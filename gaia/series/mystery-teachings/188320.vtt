00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember your dreams?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever
experienced a dream that

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.930 align:middle line:10%
felt like it really happened?

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:10%
Or have you ever become
lucid during a dream,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:10%
aware of the fact that
you were dreaming?

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:84%
We spend nearly one third
of our life sleeping.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.530 align:middle line:84%
What's happening
during this time?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Of course, our body is resting.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening with our
spirits, our consciousness,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.950 align:middle line:90%
and mind?

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that dreams are
another version of reality.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.560 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I was really young,
I've had super vivid dreams.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Being aware of my
dreams and sharing them

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:84%
with my parents and friends has
always been a part of my life.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, my dream time
has been a very enriching part

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.700 align:middle line:10%
Both my parents
were active students

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:10%
of the Edgar Cayce readings.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And in addition, my dad studied
parapsychology and the work

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.230 align:middle line:10%
of Carl Jung while in college.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And my mom's a college professor
of inter and intrapersonal

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:90%
communications.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.820 align:middle line:84%
Plus, she was really involved
with the Monroe Institute

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
that explores consciousness
and journeys out of body.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So we developed a
family tradition

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:84%
of sharing dreams and
interpreting them, especially

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.920 align:middle line:90%
when they felt significant.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.140 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, I'd
like to share with you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
some of what I've learned about
our life in the dream time.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Dreams can be such a
useful guide in our life.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
They can help us solve problems,
receive insights, and higher

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:90%
teachings from higher planes.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Learn about ourselves
and so much more.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like to share some
useful methods with you

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
for becoming more in tune
with your dream time.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
dreams, the first question

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that often comes up is,
does everybody dream?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Some people swear
that they don't dream.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.410 align:middle line:84%
But science shows dreaming
is a part of our sleep cycle.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Even if we aren't aware of
it or remember our dreams

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.660 align:middle line:90%
when we wake up, we all dream.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
Everyone goes through
a couple of REM cycles

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
at night, which is marked
by rapid eye movement

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:90%
during our sleep.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And during this
time, the brain is

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.590 align:middle line:84%
firing off with similar
patterns to when we're conscious

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:90%
and awake.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Only in this case,
we're dreaming.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.040 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, our brain can't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
tell the difference between
dreaming and wakefulness.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:90%
So everybody dreams.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Whether we remember it or not
is another matter altogether.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
when we dream?

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Are dreams meaningless
or meaningful?

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And how can we
engage our dream time

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
to support our
overall progression?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:90%
There are many types of dreams.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.510 align:middle line:10%
I have learned to group
them into four categories.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:10%
The first is what we can
call subconscious dreams.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
These are the dreams
that we're not aware of

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and the dreams that
are happening based

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.460 align:middle line:90%
on our subconscious processing.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But as we start to
become aware and we

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
engage more
consciously with trying

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.920 align:middle line:84%
to understand what our
subconscious is telling us,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.660 align:middle line:84%
we start entering the early
stages of conscious dreaming.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:84%
There are several
levels of conscious

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.890 align:middle line:90%
dreaming that we'll explore.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Then there's also
lucid dreaming,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
which is when we learn
to control our dreams.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth category is what
I call astral dreaming, where

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.630 align:middle line:84%
we are literally doing
work on the astral planes

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.665 align:middle line:90%
during our dream time.

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And then we have some
recall of that work.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's first talk about dreams
that are purely subconscious.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.540 align:middle line:84%
A good majority
of our dreams tend

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
to be like this, at least
until we start to engage

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:90%
with them more consciously.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
These are when the
deeper parts of our brain

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:84%
are trying to process
events from our day.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.579 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they were
influenced by what we ate,

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.329 align:middle line:84%
or something we saw on
TV, or some other stimuli

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
that we were exposed
to during our day.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Such dreams can
often seem random

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's hard to
follow their sequence.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps, there
are things that

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.170 align:middle line:84%
have been suppressed in the
subconscious such as fears,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:84%
emotions, or unacknowledged
parts of ourselves.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.230 align:middle line:84%
These are trying to make
their way to the surface

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.270 align:middle line:90%
of our awareness.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe something's been
bothering us in the background.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
We haven't given it
our conscious attention

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.950 align:middle line:84%
or we might even
be pushing it away.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, have you ever had
a dream where you did something

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.290 align:middle line:84%
that was so embarrassing and
when you woke up from it,

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:84%
you were feeling
a little anxious?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my
teens and early 20s,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.760 align:middle line:84%
this was a recurring
theme for me.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
I'd have dreams where
I'd go out in public,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but maybe I'd forgotten
to put on makeup

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps, I'd be only half
dressed or something like that.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And the perfectionist in
me would be so embarrassed

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and stressed about
it the whole dream,

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
until I woke up with
a sigh of relief

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:90%
that it was only a dream.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
What these were revealing
to me where some of my

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.730 align:middle line:90%
fears and insecurities.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.330 align:middle line:84%
So by my mid-20s, I really
started to pay attention

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:90%
to this recurring message.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:90%
And I decided to work on myself.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
As I overcame these
fears in my life

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and stripped away much of
my vanity and perfectionism

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
that was based on
insecurity, the dreams

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.570 align:middle line:84%
transformed until
they were no longer

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
embarrassing or stressful.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
When we start to more actively
engage and pay attention

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to our dreams,
they will progress

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
from being mostly subconscious
to becoming an amazing tool

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:90%
for growth and transformation.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
This is when we start
to enter the realm

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:90%
of conscious dreaming.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
What is conscious dreaming?

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
There are many levels
of conscious dreaming,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
but it begins when our
conscious mind starts

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to observe and become aware
of what our dreams are

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:90%
communicating to us.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.650 align:middle line:84%
At first, that awareness comes
as we wake up from a dream,

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.420 align:middle line:84%
remember it, and
contemplate its meaning.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, our
dreams speak in symbols.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually not
to be taken literally.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Understanding their
messages involves

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.340 align:middle line:84%
getting to know
the various symbols

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and archetypal
characters of our dreams.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:84%
For example, when people we
know show up in our dream,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
it's usually not
about that person,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:84%
but it's about what
they represent to us.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Every character in
our dreams typically

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:84%
symbolizes some aspect
of us, even if it's

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.880 align:middle line:90%
someone we know in real life.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So if a family member or guide
appears in one of your dreams,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
first ask yourself,
what qualities

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
do you tend to think or
feel most about that person?

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Who are they to you?

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
What role do they
play in your life?

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:84%
What is their main
characteristic?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:90%
Or how would you describe them?

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
At a symbolic dream
level, it's likely

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that this person represents
that aspect of you.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:84%
As an example, if I think of
my father as more intellectual

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.340 align:middle line:84%
and my mother is more
intuitive, them in my dreams,

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:84%
they typically represent my
intellectual or intuitive

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.940 align:middle line:90%
sides.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Then I want to pay attention
to what they're doing

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and how they're
behaving in the dream.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It's important to identify
these symbols for ourselves.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:10%
A dream dictionary
isn't going to tell you

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:10%
this because they're
personal symbols.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:84%
There are, however,
certain symbols

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:90%
that have universal meaning.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:84%
For example, animals often
have shamanic symbolism.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:10%
And the go-to references
that I like best

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:10%
when it comes to interpreting
animal symbols in my dreams

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:10%
are the "Medicine Cards" by
Jamie Sams and David Carson,

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.550 align:middle line:10%
as well as "Animals
Speak" by Ted Andrews.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes we might also
have alchemical symbols

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:10%
appear in our dream.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.409 align:middle line:10%
These tend to be
more archetypal.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:40.370 align:middle line:10%
Meaning they're part of a
universal language of symbols.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the archetypes and
how they show up in our dreams

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:90%
is really helpful.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.060 align:middle line:10%
The works of Carl Jung, Joseph
Campbell, and reference guide

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.480 align:middle line:10%
to our chemical symbols can
help us to better understand

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.600 align:middle line:10%
these archetypal symbols.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
In essence, our
conscious mind needs

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.680 align:middle line:84%
to learn the language
of our dreams.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
As we learn this
symbolic language,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
we can later use
it in a reverse way

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to communicate to our
subconscious mind.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, we might engage
our active imagination

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
by working with these
characters and symbols

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.730 align:middle line:84%
through our visualization
at a conscious level.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
We can use such methods to
consciously set intentions

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
for our dreams to give
us answers to questions

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.430 align:middle line:84%
or to get the deeper parts
of ourselves working together

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:90%
better.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
One way to do that would be
to identify our intention.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And then to create a symbol
that represents that intention.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Meditate upon that symbol
and intention for a while

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:90%
before going to bed.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And then carry the symbol
into the dream time with you.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.870 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line
with all of this is

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:00.470 align:middle line:84%
that we want to become more
aware so that we can harness

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
our dreams in such
a way that really

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.600 align:middle line:90%
aids our progression in life.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:84%
The next step is to
remember our dreams.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
Are there any tricks we
can use to get better

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:90%
at remembering our dreams?

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Remembering our dreams usually
comes down to two things.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
The first is our
lifestyle practices

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:90%
and the second, our intentions.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:84%
By lifestyle practices,
we're talking

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:84%
about everything from our
stress levels to what we eat

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:90%
and how late.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
As well as whether we
consume any substances

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.740 align:middle line:90%
that might interfere.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, alcohol,
marijuana, sleeping pills,

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and many pharmaceutical
drugs are

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.570 align:middle line:84%
things that numb or
interfere with the bridge

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.720 align:middle line:84%
between our conscious
mind and our sleep state.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:10%
Watching TV late
at night can also

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.580 align:middle line:10%
interfere with this process.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
When we watch TV,
our mind is flooded

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
with images and drama, which
then has to be worked through

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.288 align:middle line:90%
during our dream time.

00:10:59.288 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Clearing the mind with things
like meditation or a ritual

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%
practice can help us to
prepare ourselves to go

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.810 align:middle line:90%
to sleep in a more clear state.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:14.396 align:middle line:84%
What else can we do to have
a more productive dream time?

00:11:14.396 --> 00:11:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, meditation is a great
tool to also help bridge

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
from our conscious
mind into our dreams.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Having a meditation
practice in general

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.760 align:middle line:90%
is a great place to start.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Building this muscle helps us
to maintain conscious awareness

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
as we transition into a deeper
brainwave states of alpha,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.360 align:middle line:84%
theta, and even delta as
we move towards sleep.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.570 align:middle line:84%
Meditating for 20
minutes right before bed

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
gives us an opportunity
to quiet our mind

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.643 align:middle line:84%
and set our intentions
for the dream time.

00:11:47.643 --> 00:11:50.421 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:53.740 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to a
second important key

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%
for conscious dreaming,
which is our intention.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.620 align:middle line:84%
This comes down to
making an effort

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.860 align:middle line:84%
to actively engage
and create a bridge

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.226 align:middle line:84%
between our conscious
awareness and the dream time.

00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:84%
The more we pay
attention to our dreams

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and consciously work with
them, the more will remember

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and the more they'll
reveal to us.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Our first intention
is to actually

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:84%
remember our dreams
in the morning

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:90%
and then to write them down.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.970 align:middle line:84%
The second intention
is what we specifically

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:84%
want to dream about or receive
guidance on from our dreams.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Keeping a dream journal is
really helpful for remembering

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and connecting to our dreams.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Before going to bed,
write down your intention

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.922 align:middle line:90%
for your dream time.

00:12:40.922 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Then whenever you
wake up, whether it's

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the
night or in the morning,

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
write down anything that you
can remember from the dreams.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't
remember anything,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:90%
just write down how you feel.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
This practice will
help you continue

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
building the bridge between your
conscious mind and the dream

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:01.830 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I've had some amazing
archetypal dreams in my life.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the most impactful
dreams came to me

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
when I was working on
a program for women.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I was co-creating
this with a colleague

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and we came to a place
where we felt kind of stuck.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.560 align:middle line:84%
We were asking, what
are we missing here?

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.150 align:middle line:84%
We knew something was missing
that's really important for us,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.230 align:middle line:90%
as women, to understand.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.920 align:middle line:84%
And we decided to
meditate on this question

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:90%
and see what comes through.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.960 align:middle line:84%
I spent a good week
contemplating and meditating

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:90%
on it every day.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And still nothing
was really coming

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.020 align:middle line:84%
through that was clear
enough where I felt

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.460 align:middle line:90%
like my ego wasn't involved.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.590 align:middle line:84%
So one night I decided to
work with it in my dreams.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I asked my guides to
bring it to me in a dream

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.200 align:middle line:84%
so that I could get my ego
filters out of the way.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
That night I had the most epic
archetypal dream of my life.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I could totally make it
into a movie script one day.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:84%
I woke up the next
morning knowing

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.820 align:middle line:90%
I had been on an epic journey.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was so
archetypal and I knew

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
this dream held the
answers to our question.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.780 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I wrote down the details
as soon as I could.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But there were things I didn't
quite understand right away.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But they were clues
and it was all perfect.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
It was exactly what I needed
to unravel the mystery

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:90%
and come to understand.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
I started by doing
a Google search

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.950 align:middle line:84%
on a unique name that was
given in the dream that

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:90%
had me somewhat mystified.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And then that led me
to finding an article,

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
analyzing the meaning
of a character in one

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of Shakespeare's plays
by the same name.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
This then led to more
clues and insights.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.575 align:middle line:84%
The dream was so
layered that I then

00:14:47.575 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
decided I'm going to share
it with some friends who

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.730 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with this
issue and the symbolism.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And through that
dialogue, we were

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.350 align:middle line:84%
able to discover the
meaning of the dream.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.495 align:middle line:90%
And it was really profound.

00:14:59.495 --> 00:15:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Now to me, this is one of
the best uses of dreams.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.040 align:middle line:84%
To help us gain insight into
the bigger things, the deeper

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.120 align:middle line:84%
The things that we need
to understand and shift

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves individually
and collectively.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Now as we get good at
conscious dreaming,

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:84%
a more advanced goal would
be to become conscious

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.640 align:middle line:90%
within our dream.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And be able to observe and
engage with it in real time.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Is this more advanced
form of conscious

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.460 align:middle line:84%
dreaming the same
as lucid dreaming?

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:90%
Not quite.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's explore the difference.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:90%
What is lucid dreaming?

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.316 align:middle line:84%
How's it different from
conscious dreaming?

00:15:40.316 --> 00:15:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, have you ever been
in the middle of a dream

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:84%
when you suddenly
realized you're dreaming?

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, you
were able to shape or change

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:90%
the dream?

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.670 align:middle line:90%
This is lucid dreaming.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.230 align:middle line:84%
I've had lucid
dreams, for example,

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.810 align:middle line:84%
where I was having a bad
dream of something chasing

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:90%
or trying to attack me.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, I
realized this isn't real.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:90%
This is a dream.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's like waking
up within the dream.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I thought, well,

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to
fly out of here.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So I'd take flight and the
whole dream would change.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
When we become lucid and
aware within the dream,

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and consciously choose to
manipulate it and change it,

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
we can go and have
a fantastic journey.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's something we
have to learn how to do.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Now one way we can
start to lucid dream

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is to program ourselves to
check-in on whether we're

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:90%
dreaming or awake.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.730 align:middle line:84%
This starts we're doing
it throughout our day when

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:38.960 align:middle line:90%
we're awake.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.080 align:middle line:84%
We could start a habit
of looking at our hands

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and asking, am I
dreaming or am I awake?

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
If our hands stay
normal, then we're awake.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But in a dream, things
don't usually stay normal.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:56.760 align:middle line:84%
They may start to do something
funny or not quite look right.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Or we may even do
impossible things.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:05.240 align:middle line:84%
These can be triggers to
becoming lucid during a dream.

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.950 align:middle line:84%
But we have to do this
throughout the day

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.800 align:middle line:84%
to program ourselves
to check-in.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Then when we're asleep, we have
that subconscious programming

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:18.650 align:middle line:84%
to trigger us to check and
wake up within the dream.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
In a lucid dream,
we're becoming more

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
conscious of what was previously
a subconscious type of dream.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And if we choose to
change the dream,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
well, now we're
applying our will.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's, kind
of, still our egos

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:84%
will that gets in
when we become lucid.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
We tend to control the
dream from our personality

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.050 align:middle line:90%
level of things.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the higher self will
come in and guide our dream.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And here comes the
main difference

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
between lucid dreaming
and conscious dreaming.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
In more advanced forms
of conscious dreaming,

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.460 align:middle line:84%
we become aware
that we're dreaming.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But rather than trying
to manipulate it

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
with our personal
will, we ask, what

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.290 align:middle line:84%
is it that I'm supposed
to be learning here?

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
We call in our higher
self and our guides

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
to teach us and help us
understand and learn.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
We take a more
receptive role, yet it's

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.460 align:middle line:84%
still proactive and
conscious within the dream.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:21.380 align:middle line:84%
As we do this, dreams begin
to unfold in a higher form.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
We begin to consciously
engage with the archetypes.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Our higher selves and our
guides communicate with us

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
through our dreams when
we're paying attention.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.130 align:middle line:84%
The more we consciously
engage with our dreams,

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
the more we open ourselves
to this communication.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
We're participating
in this conversation.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.020 align:middle line:84%
So in conscious
dreaming, we're not

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
trying to manipulate our dream
like we might in lucid dreams.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we're asking questions
and receiving guidance

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:90%
to help us with our life.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing
about conscious dreaming

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:02.250 align:middle line:84%
is that we can really start to
use our dream time to support

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.350 align:middle line:90%
our progression.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Lucid dreaming can be
fun, but it's not usually

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
supporting our progression
in any big way.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of similar
to astral travel

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.440 align:middle line:90%
for tourist-type purposes.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a phenomenon.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:84%
It can have a lot of glamor,
and allure, and it can be fun,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
but it's not always
productive, necessarily.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
When we want to make
it more purposeful,

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.120 align:middle line:84%
we can shift into
conscious dreaming

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and use our dreams
as opportunities

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:90%
to learn and grow.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.140 align:middle line:84%
This helps us
access deeper wisdom

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:90%
to support us in our life.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Now the fourth category
of dreams that I mentioned

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is what is known
as astral dreaming.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.320 align:middle line:84%
How is astral
dreaming different?

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:90%
What does this term mean?

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And how does it relate
to astral travel?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
With astral dreams,
we're actually

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.510 align:middle line:90%
engaging with the astral planes.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not just symbolic
or archetypal.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And we all astral
travel while sleeping,

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
but it's usually during the
deepest part of our sleep

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
It might only be 15 to 30-minute
period during the night

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:90%
when we are astral traveling.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And we're usually
not aware of it.

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But if we do become aware
within an astral dream,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:90%
the experience is very, real.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Like it really happened.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And it can sometimes
be validated.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, I've
had astral dreams

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:84%
where I remember going
somewhere I'd never been before.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And even receiving
a name of a place

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.420 align:middle line:84%
and then later in
my waking life,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:90%
I did physically go there.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And it looked exactly
as it did in the dream.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:84%
Another common trait
of astral dreams

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
is that events feel
more sequential.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Other types of dreams
tend to jump around

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and we may not remember how we
got from one point to the next.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Astral dreams, on the other
hand, follow a clear sequence.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Just like in our waking
life, we may remember flashes

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:84%
of those dreams and wonder, wait
a minute, did I really do that?

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.190 align:middle line:90%
Or was it a dream?

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.020 align:middle line:90%
What's happening here?

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing in the astral
realms when we're sleeping?

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, every night
during the deepest part

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.460 align:middle line:84%
of our sleep cycle,
we all astral travel

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.980 align:middle line:84%
to the Akashic zone
to record everything

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.720 align:middle line:90%
that happened that day.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.720 align:middle line:90%
It's our personal book of life.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Also, lightworkers are those
who've said to the universe,

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:90%
I want to serve in the light.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:90%
I want to help.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.150 align:middle line:84%
We're often given assignments
during dream time,

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:84%
where our higher self
is serving at some level

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:90%
within the astral realm.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
We may be on a
council of some kind.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And we might even receive some
sort of training on the astral

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.980 align:middle line:84%
so that we can serve
at a higher level.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, I often
have dreams of being

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:84%
in a classroom or a large
gathering of some kind.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
We're being taught
by a master teacher.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Or we'll go out on a
service mission, where

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.890 align:middle line:84%
we're helping people or
helping the planet by working

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:90%
with the grids of the Earth.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:84%
When we become lucid during
these kinds of astral dreams,

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
we can engage with higher
spiritual dimensions

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.820 align:middle line:84%
in a conscious way
and learn a lot.

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:84%
This type of experience makes
us wonder, what is real?

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Is reality just what's
happening in the physical?

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Or is reality what's
happening in our mind?

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Is this physical
experience an illusion?

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:90%
A projection of a hologram?

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:84%
If we are infinite
spiritual beings having

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.180 align:middle line:84%
a physical experience,
our true self

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:84%
exists somewhere beyond
this physical dimension.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.010 align:middle line:90%
Then what's real?

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:90%
And what's a dream?

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Science has shown us
that our brain can't

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:84%
tell the difference
between a real event

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and an imagined event or the
events that happen in dreams.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:84%
The patterns of neural
firings are the same.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens within our
brain while we sleep?

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:84%
One complete sleep
cycle is typically

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.540 align:middle line:90%
90 to 120 minutes long.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Within this time, we transition
through several stages

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.590 align:middle line:84%
categorized by the
different brainwave levels.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:84%
As we start to fall
asleep, we first

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:90%
drift into a relaxed state.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Here, the brain
activity is mostly

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
in what we call the alpha
range of 8 to 13 Hertz.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:90%
We're not really asleep, yet.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can easily be woken
up in this first stage.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:40.120 align:middle line:84%
The second stage comes when we
move into the theta brainwave

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:90%
level of 3 to 8 Hertz.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.810 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're deeply
relaxed and asleep.

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
At this stage, our memories from
the day become consolidated.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And any unused synapses
of the brain are pruned.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we come
into a deep dreamless

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
sleep within the delta
range of 0.5 to 3 Hertz.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:09.970 align:middle line:84%
They call this slow wave sleep
and it's highly restorative.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:14.890 align:middle line:84%
When we astral travel, it's
often during this stage.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
There's not much brain
activity happening here.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of purposeful
practice using astral travel

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:84%
methods and deep
meditation to be

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.570 align:middle line:84%
able to maintain consciousness
when the brain slows down

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.960 align:middle line:90%
to this delta range.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But even if we're not conscious
during the astral travel

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:84%
period, the experience may
later translate into our dreams

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:90%
during the REM stage.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:84%
The final phase of our sleep
cycle, called the REM stage,

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
is characterized by
rapid eye movements.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:84%
On average, this stage begins
at about the 90 minute mark

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.650 align:middle line:90%
of our sleep cycle.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.960 align:middle line:84%
At this point, our
brainwave activity

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to
when we're awake.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:84%
This period is when we
experience dreaming.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And we have the ability to
become aware in our dreams

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.680 align:middle line:90%
during this time.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I remember one astral
dream, in particular,

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.280 align:middle line:90%
that I'll share with you.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.620 align:middle line:84%
In my waking life, I'd
been to see a healer

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and she told me I had wings.

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.950 align:middle line:84%
I was like, yeah,
whatever, I'm no angel.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.880 align:middle line:90%
I didn't believe her.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Then later that week,
I had a dream where

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.220 align:middle line:90%
I was in this big meeting hall.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.770 align:middle line:84%
And I was walking
down a corridor where

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:90%
there was a mirror to my left.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.390 align:middle line:84%
I stopped and looked
at myself in the mirror

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:90%
and I saw my reflection.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
As I saw my reflection,
I was surprised to see

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
these little black
wings on my back.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh,
I do have wings.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Look at that.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:90%
They're cute.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:52.510 align:middle line:84%
But they're so tiny
and why are they black?

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Then I moved on with the dream.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I woke up, I
remembered this image of myself

00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:90%
in the mirror.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, huh,
maybe I do have wings.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we see ourselves
in a mirror while dreaming,

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.140 align:middle line:90%
it's very symbolic.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a representation
of our energetic form.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever see
your reflection

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.460 align:middle line:84%
in a mirror during a
dream, pay attention.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Now about a month or so later,
I had another astral dream

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
where I was in some
kind of training

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.880 align:middle line:84%
learning how to navigate
and fly using my wings.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:84%
In this dream, my wings were
no longer small and black.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.020 align:middle line:90%
They were much bigger.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And I was learning this new
skill of how to fly with them.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.680 align:middle line:84%
It was like learning
how to hang glide.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.660 align:middle line:90%
It felt very visceral and real.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was a challenge learning
to balance and to the steer

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.556 align:middle line:90%
to get the method down.

00:26:47.556 --> 00:26:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Now this was some form
of astral training

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.380 align:middle line:84%
that was teaching me how
to work with my wings.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that point, any
flying dreams I ever remembered

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.040 align:middle line:84%
were more like I was trying
to swim through the air using

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:90%
my arms and legs.

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.880 align:middle line:90%
This one was very different.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
There's so much for us to
explore within our dream time.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do we build a practice
of conscious dreaming?

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's review some
steps to break it down

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.620 align:middle line:90%
into a practical formula.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
First, prepare your body.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Try not to eat anything
after 6:00 or 7:00 PM.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And avoid substances
that might interfere

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:32.420 align:middle line:84%
with dreaming including alcohol,
marijuana, or sleep medicine.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.170 align:middle line:84%
We generally experience
two to three sleep cycles

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:40.490 align:middle line:84%
throughout the night, depending
on how long we sleep for.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
One technique to help you wake
up between the sleep cycles

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
is to drink a full glass of
water before going to bed.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Now I know we don't
all want to get up

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.240 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the night to go
to the bathroom, but doing this

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
will give you the opportunity
to wake up and journal

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:84%
any dreams from that
first cycle of the night.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:84%
Now the second step is
to prepare your mind.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself 20 minutes before
bed to set your intention

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:90%
and meditate.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Do some journaling to first
get clear on what questions

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.360 align:middle line:84%
you'd like answered or
what guidance you need.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.970 align:middle line:84%
Once you get clear and set
your intention, write it down.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:28.120 align:middle line:10%
Next to this intention, draw
on the symbol of Neptune.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:84%
This symbol is an invocation
of the archetypal energy

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.105 align:middle line:84%
of Neptune, which
governs the dream

00:28:34.105 --> 00:28:37.090 align:middle line:90%
time and the subconscious.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Drawing the symbol invokes
this archetypal energy

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.540 align:middle line:84%
to come in and support
the process of answering

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:48.390 align:middle line:84%
our intention or question
through the dream time.

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:53.110 align:middle line:84%
After setting your intention,
now meditate for 20 minutes.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Relaxing your body and
emptying your mind.

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Visualize a river
flowing through your mind

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and let it wash away any
thoughts or distractions.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself to inner
stillness and peace.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.690 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Once your mind is clear,
bring your awareness

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and focus back to
your intention.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:20.300 align:middle line:10%
And now identify a symbol that
represents your intention.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Trust whatever is the first
symbol that comes to mind.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to draw
from the exercise I shared

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
in the episode on astral travel,
but with a slight modification

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that is specific to creating
a doorway for astral dreaming.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Within your mind, visualize
a dot on the wall.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Again, it could be a
black dot on a white wall

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.770 align:middle line:90%
or a white dot on a black wall.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that
dot, now overlay

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
the symbol of your intention
on top of that dot.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Focus your mind, holding your
focus on the dot on the wall

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.544 align:middle line:84%
and your intention
for the dream time.

00:30:05.544 --> 00:30:07.830 align:middle line:84%
After about five
minutes of focusing

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.590 align:middle line:84%
on the dot on the
wall, expand the dot

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.760 align:middle line:84%
until it touches the
edges of the wall.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And with the dot
expanded, visualize it now

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.890 align:middle line:84%
becoming a tunnel
and walk through.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.610 align:middle line:90%


00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The journey through
this tunnel this time

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.460 align:middle line:84%
isn't to go somewhere, like
we would for astral travel,

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.350 align:middle line:84%
but to transition
into the dream time

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:90%
with more conscious awareness.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Use the tunnel to bridge
your conscious mind

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.202 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious
dream time.

00:30:39.202 --> 00:30:43.550 align:middle line:84%
From here, gently lay
down to go to sleep.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You can recreate the
tunnel in your mind,

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.380 align:middle line:84%
passing through the tunnel and
focusing on your intention.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And then allow yourself
to drift off to sleep.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.460 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up, without
shifting your body,

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.070 align:middle line:90%
first ask yourself, where was I?

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:90%
What was I dreaming about?

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.460 align:middle line:90%
How do I feel?

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The key to remembering
is that when we wake up,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:90%
we want minimal movement.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Whatever position
your body is in,

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.660 align:middle line:84%
stay still to keep
that muscle memory.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Before we start to
journal, without moving,

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.630 align:middle line:84%
take a moment to
remember where you were

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.820 align:middle line:90%
and what was happening.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Holding still, let it
start coming back to you.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Once it starts
coming back, gently

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.510 align:middle line:84%
reach for the journal near
your bed and write it out.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Or you can use a device to
record an audio description

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.220 align:middle line:90%
of your dream.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It's best to do all of
this with minimal movement

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:90%
and disruption.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:46.890 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we start
to move too much,

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.770 align:middle line:84%
we begin losing our
state of muscle memory.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes more
difficult to remember

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:90%
until we've anchored the dream.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Even if you don't remember
things at first, ask yourself,

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:90%
how do I feel?

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Am I tired?

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.560 align:middle line:90%
Well rested?

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.360 align:middle line:90%
Positive?

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Confused?

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.840 align:middle line:84%
Review the question you
wrote down the night

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:90%
before going to sleep.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, do I have
a sense of the answer?

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Even if all you remember
is a few snippets--

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe a person, or feeling of
stress, or whatever it may be--

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:22.830 align:middle line:90%
it still counts.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.290 align:middle line:90%
So write it down.

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Even a little bit of
remembering is helpful.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And the more we practice
this process of journaling,

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.330 align:middle line:84%
the more we are conditioning
ourselves to remember.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.750 align:middle line:84%
We need to make it a
practice, a part of life

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.940 align:middle line:84%
if we want to engage
with these higher forms

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.040 align:middle line:90%
of lucid or conscious dreaming.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.920 align:middle line:84%
When we make it a practice, we
condition our subconscious mind

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:90%
pay attention.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.350 align:middle line:84%
It's an active process to
build and open this bridge

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.385 align:middle line:90%
to conscious dreaming.

00:32:53.385 --> 00:32:55.590 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.020 align:middle line:84%
To fit this in, it's
best to give ourselves

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:01.500 align:middle line:84%
maybe an extra 30 minutes or
so first thing in the morning

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.320 align:middle line:84%
to reflect and journal
before we have to get going.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And when we make this
a daily practice,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:84%
we can become more and more
conscious of our dreams.

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.570 align:middle line:84%
When we're paying
attention to our dreams,

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.890 align:middle line:84%
it opens the door for
a form of communication

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.500 align:middle line:90%
with our higher self and guides.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to us
to make the effort

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:26.610 align:middle line:84%
and reflect on what is revealed
through that universal language

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.550 align:middle line:90%
of the archetypes in our dreams.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.900 align:middle line:84%
When we get more
conscious of our dreams,

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.370 align:middle line:84%
we can use them as a tool
for progression in our life,

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.680 align:middle line:90%
towards our full potential.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.460 align:middle line:84%
We can set our intention
for anything we want.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But if it's coming
from the ego, there's

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:84%
a good chance our dreams
will reflect that and try

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.350 align:middle line:90%
to set us straight.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Conscious dreaming is
about higher consciousness.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not so concerned
with the ego's wants.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from a higher
spiritual perspective.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:00.580 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
how are we going

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.510 align:middle line:84%
to use this time
within our dreams?

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.490 align:middle line:84%
If we are aware
within the dream,

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:07.960 align:middle line:84%
are we going to
use that awareness

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.679 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate our dream for
entertainment or ego purposes?

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a higher
intention to learn and grow?

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:84%
From what level of
consciousness are we engaging?

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.949 align:middle line:84%
Remember, conscious
dreaming is about becoming

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:84%
aware of the fact
that we're dreaming.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:84%
But we're not trying
to manipulate it.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Let go of the fear factor.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:90%
Become a witness and observe.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.139 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.989 align:middle line:90%
Ask, what's the lesson here?

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:37.000 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to know?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.370 align:middle line:90%
What's my guidance telling me?

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:44.110 align:middle line:84%
How does this answer my
question or help my progression?

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:84%
Just by asking the question,
it will help bring the dream

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.360 align:middle line:90%
to a higher level.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Remember if any knowledge, tool,
or experience isn't leading

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:84%
toward your progression in life,
then it's not doing any good.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge for the
sake of knowledge

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:90%
really doesn't help us.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge that leads
towards progression

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:06.250 align:middle line:84%
is about giving us a greater
awareness of our divinity.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.230 align:middle line:84%
When we apply this
kind of knowledge,

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.380 align:middle line:84%
we can make real change
and transformation

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:90%
happen in our lives.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.470 align:middle line:90%

Join me again as we venture
into the world of crystals

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:84%
and how we can work with
them to enhance our life.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.588 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:35:22.588 --> 00:35:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring the
mysteries of the dream time

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.100 align:middle line:84%
with me in this episode
of Mystery Teachings.
