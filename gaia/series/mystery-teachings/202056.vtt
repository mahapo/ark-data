00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.580 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever felt the
call to a higher destiny

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:10%
and sought out a
guide or teacher

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:10%
who could help eliminate
that path to fulfilling it?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
These are key turning points on
any path of initiation and self

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:90%
actualization.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
meet the archetypes

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.720 align:middle line:10%
of the Hermit and the Wheel.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.640 align:middle line:84%
These are the
archetypal principles

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:84%
of being guided by wisdom
and the meaning of the call

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.560 align:middle line:90%
to destiny.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.590 align:middle line:84%
The Hermit represents
finding a guide

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and receiving one's true
magical or spiritual name, which

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.810 align:middle line:84%
happens at higher levels of
initiation into the mysteries.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:84%
While the Wheel of fortune
represents the twist of fate

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:84%
that sets us on a new path to
fulfilling our true destiny.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:10%
And with strength, we ignited
the alchemical process,

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:10%
and now, with the
Hermit, it's time

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:10%
to isolate ourselves for a while
in seclusion and introspection.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
In doing so, we can
accomplish the great work

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:84%
of transformation
and transmutation

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
without that interruption
or interference

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:90%
from the outside world.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:84%
With both the Hermit
and the Wheel,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:84%
we are now entering
into the second stage

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of the alchemical process
known as disillusion.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.120 align:middle line:10%
On the Mandala Wheel
of the 231 gates,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:10%
as it rotates clockwise
to keys 9 and 10,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.180 align:middle line:10%
we come to the final
part of the descent

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:10%
down the left side of the Wheel.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We're also in the
beginning stages

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
of seeking to understand
universal laws

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and then directly experience
the alchemy at work

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.435 align:middle line:90%
within our own soul.

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:01.210 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:10%
So next, we come on the hero's
journey to meet the Hermit,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:10%
and this is our guide that helps
to shine a light upon our path

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.230 align:middle line:10%
and illuminate the way.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
This guide may take on the
form of another person who

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
embodies wisdom and offers
us some sage advice,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.890 align:middle line:84%
or it maybe our own inner
teacher or higher self

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:84%
that we meet through
deep meditation

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.660 align:middle line:90%
and time of solitude.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
The Hermit teaches us that,
by going inward and knowing

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, we can come
to know the source,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:84%
and from there,
understand the universe.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Hermetic principle
of correspondence

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
tells us, as the
inner so the outer.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.180 align:middle line:84%
The numerology associated
with the Hermit is number 9,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
and 9 is the end of the
numerical series of 1 to 9.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So 9 is the culmination
of everything

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:90%
that has gone on before it.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the completion of a cycle.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We're coming to the end
of one stage, the descent,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and we're about to
begin a new stage

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:84%
at the turning point, which is
then followed by an ascension.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And so 9 represents
the conclusion,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:10%
and it ties together all
the different key elements,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:10%
the lessons, the
insights that have been

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.015 align:middle line:10%
gained from the previous cycle.

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:10%
Now, with this ending, there
are some weighty aspects

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:10%
that come with 9, and
these are balanced, though,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:10%
by the fool, which
is 0, which is

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:10%
the gateway to any new cycle.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And that 0 represents the
youthful appreciation for life,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.820 align:middle line:90%
and it never grows old.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
But the Hermit, on the
other hand, is the end.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.780 align:middle line:90%
It's like the ancient of days.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of us that's
experienced and wizened,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's the aspects
of our consciousness

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:84%
that can be very old
and yet very wise.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.240 align:middle line:84%
He is the culmination of
all the fool's experiences

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.655 align:middle line:84%
in the first nine
steps of this journey.

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
imagery of the Hermit.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:10%
First, I want you to take a look
at the lamp that he's holding.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.840 align:middle line:10%
This lamp is a universal symbol
of light in the darkness.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's shining the light
for us to find our way

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:84%
through the darkness, and
it represents beliefs,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.930 align:middle line:84%
which help bring
light to our lives,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and it signifies the light
of wisdom and of truth.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.360 align:middle line:84%
The Hermit holds this
light up for the seekers,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and the light that is shining
from his lantern has six rays,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and it shines out from
a six pointed star that

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:90%
is inside the lantern.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.120 align:middle line:84%
This represents the
principal and the union

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.770 align:middle line:84%
of above and below, a fire and
water, masculine and feminine,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:90%
or spirit and body.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:10%
And this union is what
creates the light of beauty

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.130 align:middle line:10%
that can guide us in our life.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:10%
Now, for support, the
Hermit leans on a staff,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:10%
and this represents the
spiritual practices which

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:10%
helped bring belief
to life, and they're

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:10%
thereby would help create
support within our daily lives.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But this staff is also
representing the middle pillar

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:90%
of the tree of life.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
As the Hermit stands there, he
is holding that middle pillar.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:90%
He is aligned.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:10%
His body is even aligned
with that middle pillar.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, upon his head is
a blue hat, and blue

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:10%
represents the high priestess.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:10%
And as the high priestess
represents the subconscious

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:10%
mind or the great mind, the
stuff from which all material

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.020 align:middle line:10%
comes from, this means
that the Hermit is crowned

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.170 align:middle line:10%
with the powers of the mind.

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.450 align:middle line:84%
We come to understand that
the highest aspect of our mind

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.120 align:middle line:84%
is this illuminated
mind with wisdom.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Hermit's whole
robe is blue, again,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.660 align:middle line:10%
which relates to
that subconscious

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:10%
of the high priestess.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:10%
And because he is
robed in blue, it's

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.970 align:middle line:10%
an indication of how our
subconscious or these deeper,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:10%
wiser aspects hidden
within the subconscious

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:10%
are also somewhat hidden from
casual access or observation.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So we can't expect to find
our innermost self just

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.052 align:middle line:84%
parading around anywhere,
such as out at the mall.

00:06:28.052 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:84%
This is something
we have to search

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
for deeply within, because it's
hidden deep within ourselves.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So this involves the process
of solitary development,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
where we isolate and
find our own space

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:84%
within our own environment in
order to connect deeply within.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's also gray
coloring within his robes,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:84%
and this represents the
blending of the opposites

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.370 align:middle line:84%
of black and white or any
complementary set of colors.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And as they blend
perfectly, they

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
come into this gray color,
which represents that wisdom

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:90%
and the oneness of identity.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.720 align:middle line:90%
So this is balancing polarity.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the Hermit stands
up on a mountain peak

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.090 align:middle line:84%
in the darkness, because what's
behind our personifications

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
of supreme reality is
dark and incomprehensible.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond our
knowing in some way.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And what this is
teaching us is that there

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.400 align:middle line:84%
are dark and unknown parts
of our greater self that

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
are necessary for us to explore
and be able to incorporate them

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:90%
in.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And so before the experience of
wholeness of our individuality

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:84%
can be actualized, we need to
incorporate all these hidden

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.805 align:middle line:90%
aspects of ourself.

00:07:48.805 --> 00:07:51.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.560 align:middle line:84%
So the Hermit stands at
the peak of the mountain,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:84%
and that means that he's climbed
that mountain of the great work

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and accomplished that self
awakening and individuation

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.510 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So he's come to
understand the laws

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.560 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmos, the universe of
spirit, and he, at the peak,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is really truly bridging
heaven on Earth.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So with this understanding
of these universal laws,

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
the Hermit is trying to help
us awaken our consciousness

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.210 align:middle line:90%
to that understanding as well.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And he holds the lantern
so that it casts away

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:84%
the darkness of the unknown
and shines more light brightly

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.010 align:middle line:84%
upon our consciousness,
until it lasts, ultimately,

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:84%
as we follow that light and we
climb that mountain ourselves,

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
we will also find ourselves
at the heights to which we

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:90%
currently now aspire.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So what's the Hermit
trying to teach us

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:48.290 align:middle line:90%
with all the symbolism?

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
This card releases energies that
help us to realize that there's

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:90%
always illumination for us.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.730 align:middle line:84%
There's always that next level
higher that we can go to,

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and it helps us realize that
we're never truly alone.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
There's life and energy
on all planes around us.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So the Hermit's path is one
of healing and illumination.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a path of understanding
that all we need to do is ask

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and it shall be given.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Knock and the door
will be opened.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:84%
The problem,
however, usually lies

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
within finding the
right way to ask,

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.850 align:middle line:84%
and then that is what these
energies are teaching us.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:10%
It's all about how to ask
the right questions so

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:10%
that the answers can
truly be revealed to you.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the Hermit,
it's like we found ourselves,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:90%
and it's an exciting experience.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a contact with
our higher self.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.810 align:middle line:90%
We actually may see the light.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:48.700 align:middle line:84%
First, we see the
light and then we

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
recognize the being
who is the Hermit

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.510 align:middle line:84%
but is our inner guide
or our higher self.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And we turn inward,
questioning all

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.770 align:middle line:84%
that we've learned
from the outer world,

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.730 align:middle line:84%
and we try to now find
the answers from within,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as finding a
sense of inner peace.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:84%
As we start to gain
this higher perspective,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
we'll realize that it's really
the way that we look at things

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:90%
that makes all the difference.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And the Hermits not just
about the need to be alone

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.470 align:middle line:84%
or to isolate, as many
people might associate

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.930 align:middle line:84%
being a Hermit
with, this is really

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:84%
about setting the
right conditions

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.830 align:middle line:84%
for experiencing what's truly
meaningful and significant.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:10%
If we can't get that
with other people,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.170 align:middle line:10%
then the Hermit would
rather have us be alone

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:10%
so that we can turn
inwards to access

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:10%
a profound state of oneness
with the divine from within,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:10%
and that comes from
knowing ourselves.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:84%
What are some other important
correspondences of the Hermit?

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, its secret
name or its esoteric title,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:90%
is the prophet of the eternal.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Or he's also called the
magus of the voice of power.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, his element
is Earth, but it's

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.500 align:middle line:84%
immutable Earth,
which is associated

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
with the astrological
sign of Virgo.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So one of the key attributes of
Virgo is this desire to serve.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, Virgo
is the virgin, as well as

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
the sixth sign of the zodiac.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So Virgos go about
their duties in a very

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
efficient and unassuming
manner, and they can actually

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.160 align:middle line:84%
become embarrassed, even,
when other people take notice

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.790 align:middle line:90%
of their accomplishments.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So Virgo's a sign
that is committed

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.320 align:middle line:84%
to attending to the
details, to organization,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:84%
as well as creating
beauty around them.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, in astrology, Virgo is
ruled by the planet Mercury,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.400 align:middle line:10%
which is exalted in this
sign, and it's also the planet

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.780 align:middle line:10%
associated with the magician.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.790 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the magician
is the inner nature

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.490 align:middle line:10%
of the Hermit, which
is why the Hermit is

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:10%
one of three cards in
the major arcana that

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:10%
has the esoteric title of
the magus of something.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:10%
The other two cars are the
Magician and the Hierophant.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:10%
So the Hermit is called the
magus of the voice of power.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Some other key words
or concepts that

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
are associated with the
Hermit include this concept

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of illumination, being a
seeker, completion, revelation,

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:31.120 align:middle line:84%
introspection, being the
strong and silent type.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.790 align:middle line:84%
The strengths that the
Hermit can help us to achieve

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:84%
or the virtues he shows us is
responsiveness, realignment,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:90%
dependability.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
These strengths are the
balanced and pure expressions

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.172 align:middle line:84%
of the Hermit, but if we either
have too much or not enough

00:12:49.172 --> 00:12:50.880 align:middle line:84%
of these qualities in
our life, then they

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:84%
become weaknesses or distortions
of the Hermit, which show up

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.600 align:middle line:90%
through the shadow side.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
things to watch out for

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.480 align:middle line:90%
could include isolating.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:10%
When we withdraw
because we're actually

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:10%
getting into our
fears or our ego,

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:10%
that's different from solitude.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Fearing things from the past.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Also, a fear of
introspection or that

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.330 align:middle line:84%
will actually lead to
a spiritual emptiness

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
because we're not in
touch with our inner self.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be an
extreme dependence

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
on a spiritual leader or
guru, or an extreme dependence

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:84%
on a psychic counselor or a
Tarot reader or an astrologer.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere that we're
giving our power away.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Another way that the Hermit
shadow might show up in us

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
is when we're cutting
ourselves off from the world

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:84%
because we don't like
people, so we just isolate.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Or we're running away
from our problems

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.310 align:middle line:90%
rather than facing them.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So as we recognize any of these
weaknesses or shadow aspects

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.470 align:middle line:84%
that are manifesting
themselves in our own life,

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
we can then start to
work with the Hermit

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
to transform them and bring the
shadow to light, and as we do,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.765 align:middle line:90%
it reveals some gifts.

00:14:02.765 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So different ways that we
can bring the shadow to light

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
will include seeking solitude
in order to find inner strength.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Also, being able to
accept the rhythm--

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.250 align:middle line:84%
the natural rhythm
of our life, which

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
includes aging and death and
coming to peace and acceptance

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.170 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
We may also find ourselves
at a crossroads of decision

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:84%
and needing to make a
decision that truly renews us.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Also, there's the ability
to solve our own problems

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.830 align:middle line:84%
through introspection
and listening

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to our own inner guidance,
which is the Hermit within us.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
A Hermit is about radiating
a higher force and light.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Think of when you first
stepped onto your path

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual growth
and discovery.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.630 align:middle line:84%
It's likely that the Hermit
showed up in your life

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.050 align:middle line:84%
at that time, whether as
another person who helped

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
point you in the
right direction or who

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:84%
offered some advice and some
wisdom that really supported

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
your awakening, or it could have
been the Hermit within you that

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
might have been what shined
that light upon your path

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
and upon your consciousness
to help you wake up

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
and self initiate.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And the more you
come to recognize

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.490 align:middle line:84%
the Hermit in yourself,
the more you also then

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:22.670 align:middle line:84%
be able to connect with one
of your other parallel lives

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.532 align:middle line:84%
where the Hermit is
the dominant archetype.

00:15:26.532 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, what might
our parallel life

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.020 align:middle line:84%
be like under the
archetype of the Hermit?

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, in times past, he
would have been the wise sage

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:10%
or the teacher of initiates.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Think of Merlin or
the alchemists who'd

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
go into isolation in order
to immerse themselves

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
in the great work
without any interference

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.090 align:middle line:90%
from the outside world.

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.580 align:middle line:84%
They'd become the Hermit
during their operations

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:84%
of transformation
and transmutation.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
But as for more
contemporary examples,

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Hermit people might become a
monk, a spiritual counselor,

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.260 align:middle line:84%
a philosopher of
esoteric teachings,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
a guide of the mystery
school tradition,

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:90%
or a behind-the-scenes advisor.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Hermits have a deep regard
for order and harmony in life,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.781 align:middle line:84%
as well as a love of
solitude and quiet.

00:16:18.781 --> 00:16:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, Hermit people also have
a high degree of integrity,

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
and they're meticulous,
and therefore, they're

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.310 align:middle line:90%
also well respected.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, other
people might put them

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.140 align:middle line:84%
into leadership
positions, whether they

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
want to be in that
position or not,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and they wind up leading more
by example than anything else.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Their life is a
testament of doing

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
the great work of
self-improvement,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and this embodiment is what
shines that light for others

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:47.150 align:middle line:90%
to see.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:10%
By working with the Hermit
and invoking its energies

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:10%
into your life, you, too,
can awaken your ability

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.175 align:middle line:10%
to connect to your
inner guidance.

00:16:59.175 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:10%
Our next step on
the hero's journey

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.095 align:middle line:10%
brings us to the
Wheel of fortune.

00:17:10.095 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Wheel is at the bottom
of the involutionary descent

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.050 align:middle line:10%
into matter.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:10%
It's also the turning point
to where we'll soon begin

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:10%
our ascension in consciousness.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
So the Wheel is a portal
or a gateway to ascension.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:90%
What happens at this gateway?

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, once we're hooked
up with our inner guidance

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.810 align:middle line:84%
from the Hermit and we're
connected to our higher self,

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:84%
we start to now feel
a little more at home

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.390 align:middle line:84%
and centered and balanced
within ourselves.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
This comfort doesn't last
long, as now our resolve

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.870 align:middle line:84%
is going to get tested
by a spin of fate.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We feel perhaps a call
to a higher purpose,

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and at this point, the universe
spins the Wheel of fortune

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
on us and this sets us
off on a new direction

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that we might not have
predicted based on anything

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:90%
that we had experienced before.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.130 align:middle line:84%
It's always pushing us
out of our comfort zone

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.646 align:middle line:90%
so that we can grow and evolve.

00:18:16.646 --> 00:18:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the numerology associated
with the Wheel of fortune

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is the number 10, and 10 is
the first double digit number

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.270 align:middle line:84%
that we've encountered
on this journey.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Any time we have more than
one digit in a number,

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
we should take the
combined meaning

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
of each number that forms
it, as well as reducing it

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.690 align:middle line:90%
to the sum of the numbers.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So what I mean by that
is that 10, for example,

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.390 align:middle line:84%
combines the ideas of number
1 and number 0 together.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:51.460 align:middle line:10%
The 1 represents individuation
and self-consciousness,

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.530 align:middle line:10%
while the 0 represents the
eternal nothing or the ine.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:01.470 align:middle line:10%
So these are the magician
and the fool coming together.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.920 align:middle line:84%
The individual, which
represents number 1,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
walks through a gate,
which is the number 0,

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.820 align:middle line:90%
and then it begins a new cycle.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.350 align:middle line:90%
So 10 is a powerful number.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
It also relates to the number
of sefirot on the tree of life,

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, it represents,
again, completion, very much

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:90%
like the number 9 does.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
But when we add the 1 plus
the 0, it gives us 1 again,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%
so this is also returning
to the unity's source.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And it shows us that the
inner essence of the 10

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
is the number 1, meaning the
inner essence of the Hermit

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.890 align:middle line:90%
is the magician.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:10%
Let's explore the imagery and
the symbolism now of the Wheel.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.540 align:middle line:10%
In the four corners, we see
the four holy living creatures,

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:58.360 align:middle line:10%
which have the bodies of a bull,
a lion, an eagle, and a man.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:84%
These are the guardians
of the four watch towers,

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
and they also represent the
four fixed signs of the zodiac.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:84%
They are the four
angelic beings that

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:84%
are mentioned, both in
Ezekiel and Revelations.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the center is
the Wheel, and there

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.500 align:middle line:84%
are three other
creatures around it.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Wheel
itself is a symbol

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:10%
of the whole cycle
of cosmic expression,

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.440 align:middle line:10%
and it's divided up into three
concentric circles surrounding

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:10%
a center point.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
And these represent
different planes

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.540 align:middle line:84%
of creation, which in Kabbalah,
we call the four worlds.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The very center
represents the source.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It is the idea or
the divine spark.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
The inner circle
just around that

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:84%
is then divided by
eight spokes, and this

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.660 align:middle line:84%
represents a universal
radiant energy

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.210 align:middle line:90%
that flows out from spirit.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
The middle circle
has, then, symbols

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
for the three essentials of
alchemy, mercury, sulfur,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and salt, which represent
the spirit, soul, and body.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And we also see another
alchemical symbol,

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.720 align:middle line:84%
which represents the
stage of dissolution,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.170 align:middle line:84%
which is the part that we're
in now in this journey.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And disillusion means to stir
and to dissolve into a aqueous

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.490 align:middle line:90%
or watery-type solution.

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Then the outer circle of the
Wheel represents the material

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:27.295 align:middle line:84%
world of manifestation, and
here, we see the letters Taro,

00:21:27.295 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
T-A-R-O on the four directions,
as well as four Hebrew letters

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:84%
within the four corners that
spell out the divine name,

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.500 align:middle line:90%
The Yod Heh Vav Heh.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, this Wheel presents us
with the Sphinx's riddle.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.930 align:middle line:84%
It conveys the whole
alchemical process

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:84%
of separating, purifying,
and recombining the three

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.780 align:middle line:84%
essentials through various
cycles of transformation.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.300 align:middle line:10%
The letters of Tarot
can also be per mutated

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:10%
into five different
words, and there

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:10%
is a well-known esoteric
motto that says,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:10%
Rota Taro Orat Tora Ator,
which roughly translates

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:16.420 align:middle line:10%
from Latin as the Wheel of
Tarot speaks the law of Hathor,

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.530 align:middle line:10%
or nature.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:22.330 align:middle line:10%
Ator is another name for the
Egyptian goddess, Hathor,

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:10%
who is also related to the
empress or mother nature

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.721 align:middle line:10%
in Tarot.

00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a
look at these beings

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:33.120 align:middle line:84%
are just on the outer
rim of the Wheel.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Around the outside, we see a
yellow serpent whose movement

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.160 align:middle line:84%
is in this wavy fashion down
the left side of the Wheel,

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and this movement of the
serpent represents the vibration

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
or the involution of cosmic,
radiant energy descending down

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:90%
into matter.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.083 align:middle line:84%
Then, just towards the
bottom and turning up

00:22:55.083 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
on the right side
of the Wheel, we

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.400 align:middle line:84%
see the jackal headed being
called the Hermanubis, which

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:84%
is a combination of
Hermes and Anubis,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and this represents the
evolution of consciousness

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.900 align:middle line:90%
from lower to higher forms.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And this Hermanubis actually
depicts the current level

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.380 align:middle line:84%
to which humanity has achieved
as a whole in our evolution

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.790 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Very few people have actually
gone beyond this level

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.420 align:middle line:84%
into the upper realms
of spiritual or cosmic

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.000 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Finally at the top,
we see a Sphinx,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
and this Sphinx represents
our true self who

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.470 align:middle line:84%
is beyond the veil
of personality

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and has finished its
evolutionary journey

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.100 align:middle line:90%
and cycle of manifestation.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So the Sphinx is always
positioned at the top,

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:90%
even as the Wheel spins.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.840 align:middle line:84%
While the other two, the
serpent and the Hermanubis,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
will move with the cycles
of involution and evolution.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Sphinx symbolizes
the work of regeneration

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.340 align:middle line:84%
and the integration that comes
at the heart of the great work.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx's human head
symbolizes the achievement

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:84%
of higher consciousness and
the victory of the mind,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and it holds a sword,
which is crafted

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:90%
from a sharpened awareness.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
That Sphinx holds the
power of liberation.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.070 align:middle line:84%
It is free from the
cycles of the Wheel,

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.150 align:middle line:84%
and identifying
with the Sphinx is

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
what can get us off the
merry go round of the Wheel.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:10%
Also, notice the color
of the Wheel, which

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.660 align:middle line:10%
is mostly an orange color.

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:10%
This represents the solar force.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like the energy
coming off from the sun,

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.630 align:middle line:10%
and then the clouds
that are surrounding it

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:47.560 align:middle line:10%
represent Jupiter, which is
associated with the Wheel,

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.130 align:middle line:10%
and Jupiter is a lord of rain
and is responsible for keeping

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.010 align:middle line:10%
the Earth alive.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.600 align:middle line:84%
The Wheel, as I
mentioned before,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:84%
is part of the alchemical
process of disillusion.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:84%
This process comes after the
burning or the calcification

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
of the first step, where the
material or what we start with

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.340 align:middle line:90%
is burned to ash in calcination.

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.770 align:middle line:84%
And we get to that
part of calcination

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.540 align:middle line:84%
through the chariot
and the strength key

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.390 align:middle line:84%
in particular where
we light that fire.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And this calcination is
about releasing the spirit so

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that it can now
transform and evolve

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and that release is
represented by the Hermit.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:84%
The next step of the alchemy
is to now take all of that ash

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and stir it up in water and
mix everything together.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this disillusion
process, some of it

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:84%
dissolves into the water,
but other parts of it

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:84%
will not dissolve and they
then sink to the bottom.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the stage of disillusion
at a personal level

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:90%
can feel rather disorienting.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.240 align:middle line:84%
It will often stir
up our emotions

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:84%
as it involves water, which
relates to our emotions.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Old patterns and thought
forms might go away from us

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.850 align:middle line:84%
as new perceptions and
understandings come in.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
This is all about
purifying, and this

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:84%
is how we become a
new creature through

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:11.620 align:middle line:90%
the alchemical operation.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.455 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it's about becoming
more of our true selves.

00:26:14.455 --> 00:26:18.040 align:middle line:90%


00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.550 align:middle line:84%
So what's the Wheel of
fortune trying to show us?

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, this path is the
universal principle of abundance

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:90%
and prosperity and expansion.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
the Wheel of fortune,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
but these things only
come with a willingness

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:84%
to change and to
keep things moving.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And the way we do that
is by taking risks,

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.490 align:middle line:84%
so we need to follow and harness
and utilize the laws of cycles

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.440 align:middle line:84%
and the universe,
but we also need

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to be open to new
opportunities as we do.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a path that teaches
us that there's also

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:56.020 align:middle line:84%
a flux and reflux, or an
ebb and flow within nature,

00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and this also creates a
rhythm within our own lives,

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and we need to learn how
to work with these rhythms.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through some other
correspondences of the Wheel.

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:11.860 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric title or the
secret name of the Wheel

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
is the lord of the
forces of life,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and the elements associated
here are a combination

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.670 align:middle line:84%
of air and fire, which
relate to the planet

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter, which is the
astrological correspondence.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jupiter is often called
the Great Fortune, or the Lord

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:84%
of Fortune, and is said to
have tremendous influence

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.410 align:middle line:90%
on prosperity.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter rules a
sign of Sagittarius,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:84%
which relates to temperance
that we'll encounter later,

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and also is co-ruling Pisces,
which is ruled by the moon

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.550 align:middle line:90%
card and the 12th house.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So its elemental energy is a
combination of air and fire.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.550 align:middle line:10%
And Jupiter is also said to
be exalted in cancer, which

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:59.790 align:middle line:10%
represents the chariot card.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.740 align:middle line:10%
And so you can see there's a lot
of connections coming in just

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:07.000 align:middle line:10%
into this one card and this
one astrological sign that

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:10%
relates to that Wheel.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jupiter is the largest
planet within our solar

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.790 align:middle line:84%
system-- at least
that we know of--

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.830 align:middle line:84%
and it represents
expansion and growth.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:22.720 align:middle line:84%
It brings luck, money,
abundance to whatever

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:90%
it comes into contact with.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:84%
So usually, when Jupiter
moves into a good house

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:84%
or a good aspect to your
planets in your natal chart,

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.090 align:middle line:84%
that usually is going to bring
luck and a positive expansion

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.542 align:middle line:90%
and growth into those areas.

00:28:36.542 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, other key words that
are associated with the Wheel

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:84%
and with Jupiter
include accomplishment,

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.870 align:middle line:90%
mastery, success.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.160 align:middle line:84%
These strengths are the pure
or the balanced expression

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Wheel, but if they get
into too much or not enough,

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.140 align:middle line:84%
we fall into the distortions and
the weaknesses of the Wheel's

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.420 align:middle line:90%
shadow side.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.610 align:middle line:84%
So some of these weaknesses
include entrapment, apathy,

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.690 align:middle line:84%
compulsion, inability
to see our choices.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Believing yourself to be a
victim of fate or feeling

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.480 align:middle line:90%
stuck in a rut.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Also, fighting change
and resisting it

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and not recognizing
opportunities when they come.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.590 align:middle line:84%
So as we recognize how
the various shadow aspects

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and weaknesses might be showing
up within us in our life,

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:84%
we can then acknowledge
them and start

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:37.780 align:middle line:84%
the work of transforming the
shadow of the Wheel into light.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:10%
So how are some ways that we
can bring the shadow to light?

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, first, we can
understand that there

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:10%
is an orderly plan
behind what might

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.980 align:middle line:10%
seem random aspects of our
life or random changes.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Trust that there is some
kind of order behind it all.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Some kind of greater plan.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Also, accept that
nature is about cycles,

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's about change,
and every situation

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:09.255 align:middle line:84%
is a potential for learning
through those cycles of change.

00:30:09.255 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Think of times
when you've either

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:84%
encountered the Wheel in life
or it's really shown up for you.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, any time when
you've had an unexpected change

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:84%
in life, whether it was an
ending or a new beginning

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.700 align:middle line:84%
or a sudden windfall
or a big loss

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that forced you to
reinvent yourself.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.500 align:middle line:84%
These are all
experiences of the Wheel.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.710 align:middle line:84%
It's also possible that you
became the Wheel for others.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you were stimulated

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:84%
by some creative
and original idea

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and you saw ways in which
you could put something

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
into a new context that
hadn't been considered before,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.590 align:middle line:84%
this might have then
started a catalytic process

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that changed things for
other people as well.

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.560 align:middle line:84%
The more you come to recognize
the Wheel in your life,

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.450 align:middle line:84%
the more it will
also connect you

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
with one of your parallel
lives, where the Wheel

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.340 align:middle line:90%
is the dominant archetype.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:84%
What might our parallel life
be like under the archetype

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.660 align:middle line:90%
of the Wheel?

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, one example of the Wheel
manifesting is as an alchemist,

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.920 align:middle line:10%
actively working in the lab
with the cycles of disillusion

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.400 align:middle line:10%
and distillation
and transmutation,

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.500 align:middle line:10%
and careers might
include things like being

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:22.330 align:middle line:10%
an entrepreneur or a strategic
advisor to big companies,

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:10%
or a financial advisor in stocks
and foreign exchange markets.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And because of their strategic
foresight and understanding

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.710 align:middle line:84%
of how to ride out
the cycles of change,

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.780 align:middle line:84%
they're very good at
making money and building

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.320 align:middle line:84%
wealth no matter what's
happening with the economy.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:84%
They'll have had their
success, and they'll have also

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.840 align:middle line:84%
had their falls
in their failures,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:47.260 align:middle line:84%
but those times have all taught
them to reinvent themselves

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.920 align:middle line:84%
and to rise again, making
them stronger and wiser

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.840 align:middle line:90%
with each cycle.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Think of how the iPhone changed
our world or social media

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:01.130 align:middle line:90%
or AI and space travel.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Think of the people who are
at the helm of these types

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:08.380 align:middle line:84%
of inventions and who are always
pushing the edge of innovation.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.720 align:middle line:84%
These are the
Wheels of our world

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.830 align:middle line:84%
that move us forward
as a collective,

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.920 align:middle line:84%
but until they
become the Sphinx who

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:22.330 align:middle line:84%
is free from the cycles of
material world pursuits,

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.940 align:middle line:84%
they'll never really fully
achieves their potential,

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:84%
because what the
world really needs

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.490 align:middle line:84%
right now are spiritually
enlightened innovators who

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:84%
want to put their gifts into
service of human evolution

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.100 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Not just into science and
technology and moneymaking.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.520 align:middle line:84%
By working with the Wheel
and invoking its energies

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.030 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you, too,
can awaken the change agent

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.460 align:middle line:90%
within you.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Join me, again, as
we explore further

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.350 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.250 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:00.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.090 align:middle line:10%

the mysteries of Tarot

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.010 align:middle line:10%
