00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Is there a harmony to all
that happens in our universe?

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.810 align:middle line:84%
Could we be part of
a cosmic symphony?

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we discover
why the laws of physics

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.689 align:middle line:10%
are potentially the same
as the laws of harmony,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.360 align:middle line:10%
and how the strings of
the cosmic orchestra

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:10%
are plucked to
create our universe.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's dive into our
multi-dimensionality,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:84%
string theory, and
some mystery school

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:84%
teachings on how to
harness vibration.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
The great Albert
Einstein, who always

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know the
thoughts of God,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
was convinced that
quantum mechanics was not

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.690 align:middle line:90%
the final answer or real thing.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:10%
He said, "Quantum
mechanics says a lot,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:10%
but it does not
bring us any closer

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:10%
to the secrets of the old one."

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.080 align:middle line:10%
Einstein spent the last 30
years of his life searching

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.430 align:middle line:10%
for a theory of everything,
a single theory that unifies

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.620 align:middle line:10%
all the forces into one.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
It would be a formulation
that describes the universe

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.220 align:middle line:84%
before all the shatterings
and symmetry breakings that

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
occurred in the first
seconds of the Big Bang.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Finding such a
theory would not only

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.060 align:middle line:84%
explain some of the
mysteries of our universe,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:84%
it would give us insight into
the nature of the multiverse.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
While Einstein was not
successful at accomplishing

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
this in his lifetime,
his legacy has lived on

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:90%
to inspire many generations.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Today, physicists
are still searching

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:90%
for this theory of everything.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Many ideas have been proposed.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.090 align:middle line:84%
None have yet been verified
beyond the standard model.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 align:middle line:84%
But there is a leading
candidate called

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.450 align:middle line:84%
M-theory that unified several
string theories together

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
into a sophisticated
and elegant framework.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:90%
What's unique about this model?

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.620 align:middle line:84%
For starters, it goes
deeper than quarks

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and says that the truly
fundamental components

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.780 align:middle line:84%
of a reality are
harmonically vibrating,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.080 align:middle line:84%
supersymmetric
strings and membranes.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:84%
What's meant by strings
and membranes here?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
A common analogy is to
imagine a guitar string

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.390 align:middle line:90%
or the membrane of a drum.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.030 align:middle line:84%
When we pluck the string
or strike the drum,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.060 align:middle line:84%
we cause it to vibrate at
certain frequency or note,

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.770 align:middle line:90%
producing a sound.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Recall from other episodes
that cymatics has shown us

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
how the vibrational energy of
sound can also shape matter.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way, string
theory and M-theory

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
say there are vibrating
filaments of energy that

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.840 align:middle line:84%
are the cause of all
particles, forces,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:84%
and even the dark matter in our
universe and the dark energy.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.590 align:middle line:84%
These different
particles and forces

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
are thought of as different
notes or frequencies

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
of vibration playing on the
quantum string or membrane.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.710 align:middle line:84%
This idea ties in
with the concept

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.410 align:middle line:84%
that everything is energy,
as well as the Hermetic

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Principle of Vibration that
says everything vibrates.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:84%
This principle explains
that the differences

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:84%
between different manifestations
of matter, energy, mind,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and even spirit result
largely from varying

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:90%
rates of vibration.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So what is this
energy of vibration?

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.160 align:middle line:90%
What is its essence?

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, M-theory says it's
the strings and membranes.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:90%
But what actually is vibrating?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.830 align:middle line:90%
What are these things made of?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
String theory has proposed that
it's the fabric of space itself

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
that is folded or curled up
in a certain geometric pattern

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:90%
at every point.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we see this
folding up of space though?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's two reasons given.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.540 align:middle line:84%
First, it's happening through
seven extra dimensions

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
beyond our usual perception
of three dimensional space.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And second, these
extra dimensions

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:84%
are only found at the
smallest microcosmic scale,

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:84%
smaller than quarks
and electrons

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
at 10 to the minus 32
centimeters across,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.310 align:middle line:90%
which is very tiny.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.920 align:middle line:84%
These quanta of space
are far too small

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.320 align:middle line:84%
for even our most powerful
detectors and particle

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
accelerators to access directly.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Even though these extra
dimensions are hidden,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.500 align:middle line:84%
they still have an impact
on things we can observe.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
This is because the shape
of the extra dimensions

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.070 align:middle line:84%
constrains how the
strings can vibrate.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Just to recap, what
we're exploring here

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
is the possibility
that space time

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is curled up into some
multi-dimensional geometry.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.350 align:middle line:84%
As this vibrates at
different frequencies,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
it produces all the
energy, particles, forces,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and various other parameters
that make up our universe

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:90%
and make it what it is.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.790 align:middle line:84%
These different
particles and forces

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.840 align:middle line:84%
are then responsible for all
the splendor and diversity

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:90%
we see in the world around us.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Now on that note, recall
from other episodes

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that our universe
just so happens

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.600 align:middle line:84%
to be finely tuned for life and
consciousness to evolve in it.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
There are over 20 fundamental
constants in our universe

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that are all necessary for
the development of life.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Change any one of those values,
and the universe we know

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:90%
would not exist.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
How is it that our universe
is so finely tuned?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Well string theory
has proposed that what

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
determines this fine tuning and
all the unique characteristics

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.230 align:middle line:84%
it brings to our universe
is the particular geometry

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
of the extra higher
dimensions that

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.960 align:middle line:84%
govern the formation of
these strings and membranes.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Here again, we see physicists
talking about things

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
that metaphysicists
have said for ages,

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.230 align:middle line:84%
namely that our universe is
built upon sacred geometry.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Although in this
case, the geometry

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.490 align:middle line:84%
is only found at
the quantum scale,

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:90%
in 11-dimensional hyperspace.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Mathematics of
string theory only

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:84%
works in a universe of
10 dimensions of space

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and 1 dimension of time, giving
a total of 11 dimensions.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:84%
This breaks down into some
significant numerology

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:90%
of 1, 3, 7, and 11.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.100 align:middle line:10%
1 dimension of time plus 3
dimensions of regular space

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:10%
and 7 extra dimensions
of hyperspace

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:10%
that curls up on
itself, bringing us

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:10%
to a total of 11 dimensions.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, numerologists like
to add numbers together.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.970 align:middle line:84%
So when we add 1
plus 3 plus 7 plus 11

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
we get 22, which
also reduces to 4.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about these numbers

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
is that they are all
highly significant

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:90%
in a cabalistic framework.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The 1 represents the spark that
initiates creation and sits

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:90%
at the apex of the tree.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.580 align:middle line:84%
3 represents the top triad
of the realm of spirit.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
7 represents all the rest
of the tree below the abyss,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.850 align:middle line:84%
as well as the number
of vertical levels

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:90%
there are on the tree.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
11 is the hidden numerology
that the tree reveals to us,

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:84%
represented by the
hidden sefirah called

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:90%
da'at, which means knowledge.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.090 align:middle line:84%
22 is then equal to the
number of connecting pathways

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.400 align:middle line:84%
on the tree, which
also correspond

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
to the number of letters
in the Hebrew alphabet.

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:middle line:84%
And 4 shows up in
many ways on the tree,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
but most prominently,
we talk about the four

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:90%
worlds of creation.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I find it fascinating that the
mathematics of string theory

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:84%
reveals the same significant
numbers as Kabbalah.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are
accustomed to thinking

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:90%
of space time as continuous.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But to find a unified
theory, we need a way

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:90%
to account for quantum gravity.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
According to Einstein's
general relativity,

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.880 align:middle line:84%
gravity is the
bending of space time.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:84%
This indicates that
one possibility

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.870 align:middle line:84%
for getting a quantum gravity is
to quantize space time itself.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Recall that when
something is quantized,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.770 align:middle line:84%
it means it is discrete
instead of continuous.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:90%
It has gaps.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And within that gap
is the quantum vacuum.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So rather than
thinking of spacetime

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.590 align:middle line:84%
as a continuous
sheet, think of it

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:84%
more as a finely
woven fractal grid.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And as we go down to
the quantum scale,

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.370 align:middle line:84%
we can imagine that there are
gaps between the junctions

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:90%
of the grid.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.910 align:middle line:84%
And at the junctions
are the points

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.710 align:middle line:84%
where space is curled up into
multi-dimensional geometric

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:90%
shapes that vibrate.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:84%
These quanta of space have a
complex interwoven geometry.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.799 align:middle line:90%
What geometry is it?

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the big question that
scientists don't know yet.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
But one example often given is
called the Calabi-Yau manifold

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:90%
shown here.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.040 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine
that all around us

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
is this grid of quantum
geometric shapes,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:90%
and we can move through them.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:84%
These extra dimensions are right
in front of us and around us

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
all the time, but we
aren't aware of them

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:84%
because they don't register
with our five physical senses

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
How often are we moving
through energies and dimensions

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:90%
that we aren't even aware of?

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, whether
we're looking at it

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.090 align:middle line:84%
from a scientific
perspective, psychological,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual perspective,
it's all the time.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:84%
This is a good reminder
for us that just

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:84%
because we don't see
or feel something,

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean it's not there.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Can we become more
aware of these things?

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.920 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we can.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
It requires training our mind
to access higher consciousness,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.130 align:middle line:84%
as well as the proper knowledge
of how to shift our vibration.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
This brings us back to
the Hermetic Principle

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
of Vibration, and how the
mystery schools trained

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
initiates to master and apply
this principle at physical,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:90%
mental, and spiritual levels.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
In music, different
instruments are

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:84%
capable of making
different types of sound

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and at different
frequency ranges.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
The vibrations capable
of being produced

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.140 align:middle line:84%
depend on the shape
of the instrument.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:84%
For example, an electric
guitar makes different sounds

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:90%
than a bass guitar or violin.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Then, for any
particular instrument,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
the person playing it
can also interact with it

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to create different sounds,
harmonies, and music.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Each instrument
has its limitations

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.490 align:middle line:84%
depending on the allowed
vibrations or notes

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
it is designed to play.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:34.970 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way, we can imagine
these geometrically enfolded

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.630 align:middle line:84%
bits of multi-dimensional
space are

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.050 align:middle line:84%
a type of instrument, which
type depends on the underlying

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:90%
geometry.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
String theorists say
that our universe

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.260 align:middle line:84%
would have just one
type of geometry

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:90%
at every point in space.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So only one kind
of instrument plays

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:90%
the symphony of our universe.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But that instrument
or geometry can

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:84%
play a variety of
vibrations and notes,

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
each one producing a
different particle,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.780 align:middle line:84%
force, energy, or
fundamental constant

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.820 align:middle line:90%
that governs our universe.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Each point in space could
be playing a different note.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So we can imagine
a cosmic orchestra

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
all using the same instrument,
yet this instrument

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:84%
is quite diverse and
beautiful in the vibrations

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.790 align:middle line:90%
it is capable of producing.

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
the orchestra is not

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
really limited by having
only one type of instrument,

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.750 align:middle line:84%
plus the instruments are
finely tuned in our universe

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.270 align:middle line:84%
to create life
and consciousness.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, who are the players
of these instruments?

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics has verified
that physical particles

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
or waves only exist
upon observation.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
When we observe things,
it changes things

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:84%
depending on how we
choose to observe

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
or the assumptions we make.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Once we have made
an observation,

00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:84%
that thing we observe then
becomes entangled with us.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So it continues to exist
because we observed it,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
because we have knowledge
or information about it

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:90%
in our memory.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
The physical
particles themselves,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.490 align:middle line:84%
while they are sentient, meaning
they can sense and interact

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
with things in
their environment,

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.940 align:middle line:90%
they are not self thinking.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
They are not equipped with
their own mind and will.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Another way of putting that
is that they cannot observe

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:90%
themselves into being.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Could it be then that we,
as conscious observers, who

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.340 align:middle line:84%
have mind, will, and volition
are the ones who determine

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and also change
physical reality?

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
If so, does that mean
that we are the players

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:90%
of these instruments?

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Ancient mystery teachings
say, yes, our thoughts

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.210 align:middle line:90%
create our reality.

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts are
directed by mind,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.740 align:middle line:90%
and mind is directed by will.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
But the question is, which will?

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Is it the ego's will
coming from selfishness,

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:84%
or is it the collective will, as
in being swayed by programming

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:90%
or herd mentality?

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Is it the will of
nature and the universe,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:84%
meaning we are aligned with
the universal laws and flow

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:14.370 align:middle line:84%
of nature, but also
then bound by them?

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the will of
our eternal divine self,

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
spirit's will, God's will, which
is infinite and has no limits.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Becoming aligned and in the flow
with that highest divine will

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
is what we must
become attuned to.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.600 align:middle line:84%
So consider it like
the master tuner

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that each player
in the orchestra

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.410 align:middle line:84%
needs to tune
their instrument to

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
in order to be in
harmony with the whole.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:84%
If we are players in
a cosmic symphony,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.650 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it be nice if we could
become well-trained musicians

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:51.330 align:middle line:84%
who know how to tune, and then
use these instruments properly?

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.920 align:middle line:84%
As of now, most
people don't know

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:84%
how to use their instruments
well or even at all.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So the symphony
we are producing,

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.140 align:middle line:84%
at least here on Earth,
is chaotic and dissonant.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.250 align:middle line:84%
And since we are connected
with the entire universe,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
our chaos is sending
ripples across the cosmos.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.710 align:middle line:84%
The things we think, do, and say
send ripples through the Milky

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Way and beyond.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So again, how can we become
more masterful at playing

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:90%
the strings of creation?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we don't
become virtuosos

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
by doing nothing to
improve our abilities.

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Ask any maestro and they
will all say the same thing.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.510 align:middle line:84%
We only master the art
through proper training, lots

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.280 align:middle line:84%
of daily practice,
and then having

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
bigger and bigger opportunities
to perform at the best.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what the ancient
mystery schools were all about.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's return to the Hermetic
Principle of Vibration.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticists have been
revealing these phenomenon

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:84%
long before modern
science and string

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.180 align:middle line:90%
theories were been around.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years, initiates

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:84%
to the hermetic
lineage have taught

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
that everything is of one
essence just manifesting

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:84%
at different degrees
or modes of vibration.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And by everything,
it means all of it,

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:84%
from the densest of matter
to things like sound, light,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:84%
the forces of nature, down to
the subatomic particles which

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
are vibrating at
very high rates,

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.080 align:middle line:84%
and then moving even beyond
that into mind and all

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:84%
its varying expressions
through our thoughts,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.780 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and desires,
and all the way up

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.540 align:middle line:84%
to the highest realms
of pure spirit.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.290 align:middle line:84%
It is all the same
essence, just vibrating

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:90%
at different frequencies.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.890 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, could
we adjust the frequency,

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:84%
like turning the
dial on the radio

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
to transform and transmute
from one mode or manifestation

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:90%
of that essence into another?

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and this is the
core of true alchemy.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:57.720 align:middle line:84%
It is the art and
science of transformation

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and transmutation
through the process

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
of extracting the essence and
then shifting its vibration,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
primarily with the aim
of raising vibration.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Even string theorists
today are saying

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
that if we were to pluck one of
these vibrating superstrings,

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
it would change mode
and transform from

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:90%
say a quark to a neutrino.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Pluck it again in a different
way and it becomes an electron.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
That would be true
transformation.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
String theory aside, we already
know from particle physics

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that, with enough
energy, we can get

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
quarks to pop out of
the quantum vacuum

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and generate new
types of matter.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And modern atomic
physicists have

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.830 align:middle line:84%
proven that we can indeed
turn lead into gold

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:90%
using particle accelerators.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just not cost effective
the way that scientists

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.720 align:middle line:90%
are doing it today.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, the
Hermetic initiates

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:10%
also say there is an
ethereal substance that

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:10%
is the connecting link between
the forms of vibratory energy,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:10%
known as matter on the one
hand, and energy or force

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.090 align:middle line:10%
on the other.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:10%
They describe this ethereal
substance as of extreme tenuity

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.849 align:middle line:10%
and elasticity, and it
pervades universal space,

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:10%
serving as a medium
of transmission

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:10%
of waves of vibratory energy.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:10%
As a side note, Nikola Tesla
used very similar wording

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.390 align:middle line:10%
in his essay on Man's
Greatest Achievement.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.180 align:middle line:84%
He said, "Long
ago, man recognized

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.880 align:middle line:84%
that all perceptible
matter comes

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
from a primary substance of a
tenuity beyond all conception

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:38.370 align:middle line:90%
and filling all space."

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Makes one wonder
if Tesla might have

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:84%
been one of the three
initiates who authored

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:90%
the "Kybalion" in 1912.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
At any rate, they are clearly
talking about the ether

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.750 align:middle line:84%
here, which we now know is
not so much a physical medium,

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:55.560 align:middle line:84%
but rather the quantum
vacuum or zero point field.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:84%
This vibrational
level of the ether

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
matches up with the level for
these hyperdimensional strings.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But the Hermeticists go further
with the vibrational spectrum

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.000 align:middle line:90%
than do physicists.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.290 align:middle line:84%
They push higher into the
realms of mind and spirit.

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:90%
What is all this saying?

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:90%
How can we use this?

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Well first, it is
important to realize

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:84%
that the connecting point is
the ether or the quantum vacuum.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Mind and spirit are above
that vibrational level,

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:90%
while matter is below.

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:33.000 align:middle line:84%
This puts superstrings or
etheric energy in the middle.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
This is the transition
point or mediator

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.050 align:middle line:84%
between what we typically call
physical and non-physical.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But it is really all
the same essence, just

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
different vibratory rates with
the so-called non-physical

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:84%
levels vibrating
at such high rates

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:84%
that most of our detectors are
not able to directly measure

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%
them yet.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysically, however, we can
interact with these energies.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.400 align:middle line:84%
How do we influence
etheric energy?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's through the will,
which we mentioned just

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
a moment ago as the driving
force behind the observer

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:90%
effect.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And yes, will is a force.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Will moves our mind, which
directs our thoughts,

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.470 align:middle line:84%
that then determine our
actions and what we manifest.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Mystery school teachings
say that etheric energy

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:90%
is made of the essence of will.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:90%
Whose will?

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Where does this will
energy come from?

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Well there are actually
three layers to it.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.740 align:middle line:84%
At the highest vibrational level
is the will of divine source.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.540 align:middle line:84%
We could say it is
the will of God,

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:84%
but by using the
word "God" here,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:84%
we mean the ultimate
source, which

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:84%
in Kabbalah is called
ein sof, meaning

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:90%
infinite and without end.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:84%
We could also call it
the will of spirit,

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.610 align:middle line:84%
meaning our infinite
eternal self.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
As the will of source
flows into the universe,

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.380 align:middle line:84%
it then forms
another layer, which

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:84%
we call the will of
nature and the universe.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
This will keeps things flowing
in the order established

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:90%
by the laws of nature.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:10%
And finally, the
third layer comes in

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.170 align:middle line:10%
as the will energy flows into
our collective human will,

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:10%
which we call the
will of humans.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.520 align:middle line:10%
This third layer of
the will of humans

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.300 align:middle line:10%
is its own layer because the
spiritual teachings all tell us

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:10%
that humans were given
the will to choose

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:10%
between good and evil.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.250 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.190 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard the
story in Genesis

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.290 align:middle line:84%
where Adam and Eve ate
of the tree of knowledge

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.390 align:middle line:84%
of good and evil
and then felt shame

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.330 align:middle line:84%
and were subsequently
sent out of the Garden.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And usually when
we're told this story,

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.490 align:middle line:84%
it comes with the dogma of
us having sinned and being

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.190 align:middle line:84%
punished by God because
of it, leaving us

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.850 align:middle line:84%
with a burden of guilt and
a sense of unworthiness.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah tells the story
from a different perspective,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:84%
or actually several
different perspectives.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.970 align:middle line:84%
One cabalistic version
says that similar to how

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.910 align:middle line:84%
there was an initial shattering
or symmetry breaking that

00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:84%
kicked off the Big
Bang, it was inevitable

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that humanity would
go through its own

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.080 align:middle line:84%
shattering or breaking with the
oneness of source or spirit.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Because only by going
through this process could

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.390 align:middle line:90%
we then have choice.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And only by making choices,
and learning from the results

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and consequences
of those choices,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
do we grow in understanding,
and hopefully wisdom.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So rather than this physical
life being a punishment,

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:84%
it is a gift that grants us the
opportunity to learn and grow

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:90%
by our own efforts and choices.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And the whole notion
of sin in Kabbalah

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:84%
is more about an accumulation
of friction or karma

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that we create as
we miss the mark.

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:44.940 align:middle line:84%
What's meant by
missing the mark?

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, it comes back
to our use of will.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Similar to how the
shattering of the Big Bang

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:84%
broke up the unified superforce
into separated force fields,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.450 align:middle line:84%
so too did the
shattering of humanity

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.920 align:middle line:84%
not only make us feel separate
from each other and paradise,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
it also caused
the will of humans

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to break away from the
will of the divine.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.590 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that the
collective human will now

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:14.930 align:middle line:84%
tends to flow contrary
to the divine will.

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:10%
And we established
in other episodes

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:10%
that the will of nature
and the will of spirit

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:10%
prefer to move in a
clockwise flow, which

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:26.220 align:middle line:10%
is a flow that builds towards
life and its progression.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:84%
If the will of humans
flows contrary to that,

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:84%
then it tends to flow
counterclockwise.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.940 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of evidence
in our human-made world

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.620 align:middle line:84%
to see how our collective
trends flow more

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
against nature,
against divinity,

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and even unconsciously
seem to prefer

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.212 align:middle line:84%
counterclockwise
movements over clockwise.

00:22:47.212 --> 00:22:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Just start paying
attention to this

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:90%
and you will see for yourself.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we imagine these three
layers of etheric energy,

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:84%
two of them are
flowing clockwise,

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
while the third is
flowing counterclockwise.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.030 align:middle line:90%
What will that generate?

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
How about friction,
resistance, tension,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:90%
wasted energy, and stress?

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And at a personal
level, when we are

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to connect to the
light flowing in from source,

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like an Indiana
Jones obstacle course,

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.950 align:middle line:84%
trying to get that light through
to reach us here at this level,

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.520 align:middle line:84%
or that we have to go
through within our own mind

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.880 align:middle line:84%
in order to rise above the
static of the collective mind

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
and into the
experience of oneness.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.730 align:middle line:84%
Another way we could say this
is that it blocks the light.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we might
feel indecisive or pulled

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.370 align:middle line:90%
in different directions.

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Part of us wants this,
another part of us wants that.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.320 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to freely
choose by our own will

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.580 align:middle line:84%
to align with the
higher wills, to align

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:84%
with the flow of
nature, to align

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:90%
with the flow of divinity.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And when we don't,
that is when we

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.420 align:middle line:84%
miss the mark and
this resistance

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.640 align:middle line:90%
accumulates in our energy field.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:84%
But when we do, that is when
we feel the most in the flow.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:12.190 align:middle line:84%
We feel alive, full of joy,
love, passion, and desire

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.650 align:middle line:90%
to serve our fellow humans.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
This brings us into
a coherent state.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
And remember, if we want to
influence the quantum realm,

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:90%
we must be in a coherent state.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So influencing etheric
energy or learning

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.020 align:middle line:84%
to pluck the strings of
creation is really more

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
about aligning our
will with higher will

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.550 align:middle line:84%
to come into that coherent
and congruent state of being.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:44.380 align:middle line:84%
When we do, things will flow
and manifest for us like magic.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.390 align:middle line:90%
This is a major key.

00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The question now is,
how do we do that?

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
How do we know what
that divine will even

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.030 align:middle line:84%
is if it's so hard
for us to reach it

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.110 align:middle line:90%
in our daily awareness?

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we discern
between our ego's will,

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:84%
the collective will,
and higher will?

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
First, we need to
know ourselves and get

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.370 align:middle line:84%
good at tuning in to when
we feel that inner tension

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.050 align:middle line:90%
or resistance.

00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, we can turn again to
the ancient mystery teachings

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:90%
for guidance and support.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's start by defining what
good and evil really mean.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:24.820 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, the
primordial will to good

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
sits at the top of
the tree of life.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:84%
In other words, this
is the divine will.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:84%
It is the will to create
goodness, the will

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.180 align:middle line:84%
to progress towards
the full realization

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.010 align:middle line:90%
of divine potential.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
The vibration of this
will is pure agape love.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Not the kind of love we
humans typically think of,

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:51.220 align:middle line:84%
but the limitless force of
creation that is the divine

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:53.770 align:middle line:90%
love flowing from source.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.500 align:middle line:84%
That agape love is
the master frequency

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.980 align:middle line:84%
we want to tune our
instruments into.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:84%
We want to let it
fill us completely.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.280 align:middle line:84%
This energy of love,
the divine will,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.800 align:middle line:84%
is always present,
just waiting for us

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:90%
to open up and receive it.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.450 align:middle line:90%
How do we open up to receive?

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.620 align:middle line:10%
We can start with meditation
and quieting our lower mind.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:10%
But more than that,
we must also have

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.650 align:middle line:10%
enough faith that,
one, it's here,

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:10%
and two, that we are
worthy of receiving it.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:31.270 align:middle line:84%
If we doubt too much, lack
faith, or feel unworthy,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.240 align:middle line:84%
that is our lower mind kicking
in again and blocking us

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.290 align:middle line:90%
from receiving.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I find the best way to
trust and have faith

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:90%
is to shift into the heart.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately though, so many
people have shut their hearts

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:84%
down due to past
traumas and that we

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.650 align:middle line:84%
need to first heal in order to
feel safe in that open heart

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And for those people, just
know that there is always hope,

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.540 align:middle line:84%
hope that things can get
better, that we can heal.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And that when we take steps in
the direction of our healing,

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that is aligned
with the divine will

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.270 align:middle line:84%
because it is an
act of self-love

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:90%
to pursue our healing.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Then as we move further,
we must cultivate

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.330 align:middle line:84%
faith, faith in ourselves
and our worthiness, faith

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.510 align:middle line:84%
in the divine presence and
the goodness that is all

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
around us, faith in love.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.240 align:middle line:90%
Faith is what opens the door.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Then in time, after
enough direct experience

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:34.380 align:middle line:84%
of receiving that love,
we move beyond faith

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.830 align:middle line:84%
into knowing and
truly understanding.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a great passage in
the Gnostic Gospel of Philip

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
that says, "Faith is
receiving and love is giving.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Non can receive without faith,
and none can give without love.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.330 align:middle line:84%
When we believe, we are
then capable of receiving.

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:58.170 align:middle line:84%
We give so that we
may experience love.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Whoever gives without
love experiences

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.126 align:middle line:90%
nothing of importance."

00:28:02.126 --> 00:28:06.410 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to
a third key when

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
it comes to aligning with
the flow of divine will,

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.380 align:middle line:84%
and that is to give
from divine love

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
without condition or attachment,
to give in pure service.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
And by service
here, we don't mean

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
to give to others at
the expense of ourselves

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:84%
because that is not
sustainable in the long run.

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.820 align:middle line:84%
When we are truly in service,
we are following love and giving

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:34.380 align:middle line:90%
from love and nothing else.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.010 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
truly do that and not

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.710 align:middle line:84%
allow our ego to
pollute the love

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
is if we fill ourselves
wholly and completely

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.410 align:middle line:84%
with that vibration
of agape love.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, we serve ourselves
first by filling our cup,

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.780 align:middle line:84%
and then from our overflow, we
then give and serve to others.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
The service to self comes from
having a spiritual practice,

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
as well as taking
care of ourselves,

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.920 align:middle line:84%
actively pursuing our healing
and improvement of our skills

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.310 align:middle line:84%
so that we can better serve
others in the long run.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, we don't want

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
to wait to be in service to
others before we're 100% healed

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:90%
and in our own mastery.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work that way.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:84%
As Philip said, we give so
that we may experience love.

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
By actively stepping
into service to others,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.950 align:middle line:90%
that love flows through us.

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And from this, we continue to
grow and heal and become better

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:90%
able to serve at higher levels.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.190 align:middle line:10%
This is what leads to
mastery and wisdom.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:84%
If we are players in
a cosmic symphony,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
and if geometrically vibrating,
multi-dimensional strings

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:84%
are the instruments,
which exists

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:51.570 align:middle line:84%
at the vibrational level of the
ether or quantum vacuum that

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:55.560 align:middle line:84%
is influenced by
coherent will, then how

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.960 align:middle line:84%
do we become more
masterful at playing

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:90%
these strings of creation?

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:04.260 align:middle line:84%
By aligning with divine
will and filling ourselves

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:84%
with the vibration
of agape love.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.580 align:middle line:84%
When we embody the
vibration of love,

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.570 align:middle line:84%
we also emanate the
vibration of love.

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:16.050 align:middle line:84%
On the flip side, when we
are full of doubt or judgment

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.830 align:middle line:84%
or negative vibration, then
that is what we emanate.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Empaths tend to
be people who are

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.980 align:middle line:84%
more sensitive to feeling these
vibrations that others emanate.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And while they
may sometimes feel

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:31.040 align:middle line:84%
like it's a curse to the
person who is empathic,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.100 align:middle line:84%
it is actually a gift that
we can use when we also

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:84%
become more masterful
at harnessing

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.880 align:middle line:90%
the principle of vibration.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:84%
This relates to what is known
in science as entrainment.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
Briefly, entrainment
is the phenomenon

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.410 align:middle line:84%
of getting vibrating systems
to vibrate together in sync.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We humans have many
frequencies we can vibrate at.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Mastering the
principle of vibration

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
is about being able to set
our vibration to the desired

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:04.450 align:middle line:84%
frequency at will, and then
intentionally emanate this

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
out to others to entrain
them to that frequency.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:84%
When we are coming from the
frequency of agape love,

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that is when we are truly
aligned with the highest

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.650 align:middle line:84%
divine will and in
service to those

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.320 align:middle line:90%
we touch with this vibration.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Those we touch still have to
choose to let it in and receive

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:84%
it, but we are holding that
possibility and invitation

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.610 align:middle line:84%
without any attachment
or judgment for them

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:84%
to lift up to their
own inner potential

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:38.350 align:middle line:84%
to remember and embrace
that they are love,

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that they are divine
eternal beings.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.240 align:middle line:90%
That is service.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is how we
become virtuosos

00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:52.580 align:middle line:84%
in our human ensemble of the
cosmic orchestra of life.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:84%
With this new
level of awareness,

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.080 align:middle line:84%
our minds expand to
greater knowledge

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:84%
of our multi-dimensionality
and the potential

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.520 align:middle line:90%
that is within us.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.250 align:middle line:84%
As the Hermeticists
say, he who understands

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:08.990 align:middle line:84%
this principle of vibration has
grasped the scepter of power.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.290 align:middle line:84%
The power is indeed
within our grasp.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Even though string
theory remains

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.340 align:middle line:84%
to be confirmed by
experimental evidence,

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
it is a particularly
beautiful model.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.790 align:middle line:84%
As physicist Michio Kaku
writes, "The universe

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.670 align:middle line:84%
is a symphony of strings,
and the mind of God,

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.400 align:middle line:84%
which Einstein
eloquently wrote about,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:84%
is cosmic music resonating
through hyperspace."

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Vibration determines
everything in string theory.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.420 align:middle line:84%
The challenge
physicists now face

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.150 align:middle line:84%
is identifying
the exact geometry

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:90%
of the extra dimensions.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.820 align:middle line:84%
They have many candidate shapes
that are allowed by the math,

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.820 align:middle line:84%
over 10 to the power of
500 possibilities, which

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:84%
is such a huge number
that we might as well

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:90%
say it's infinite.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%

of physical laws and tuning.

Rather than saying there can be
only one right answer resulting

in only one universe,
namely ours,

string theorists are
now going even further

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:15.020 align:middle line:84%
by proposing that perhaps
all of these possibilities

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
exist somewhere
in the multiverse.

Join me again as we
expand into the multiverse

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.680 align:middle line:84%
to explore what lies
beyond our universe.

Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.860 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with me in this
episode of "Mystery Teachings."
