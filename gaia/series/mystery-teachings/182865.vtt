>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.350 align:middle line:10%
We often hear talk of ascension
in various spiritual circles.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:10%
But what, really, is it?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we take a
look at what this process is

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:10%
and why now is the
time for humanity

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:10%
as a collective to
make this great leap.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the ages,
humans have sought ways

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:90%
to fully realize our potential.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:84%
Over the millennia,
Mystery Schools

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:84%
have accumulated knowledge,
understanding, and wisdom

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.780 align:middle line:84%
for how we can ascend, both
individually and collectively.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:84%
This method for
reaching new heights

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:84%
in our spiritual
evolution is what

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
is known as the art and
science of ascension.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.595 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:59.595 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people associate the
idea of ascension with leaving

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
the Earth density or
transcending the body.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But this is a
misleading concept.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.760 align:middle line:84%
That is what happens
after physical death

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:90%
not while we're still alive.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Ascension is not about leaving
the physical body behind

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:90%
and escaping the Earth.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it's about
ascending the body with us,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
taking it up to
higher vibrations,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.710 align:middle line:84%
while simultaneously embodying
more of our full divine

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:90%
potential into this body.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.640 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, we have
to transform and transmute

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
the physical body into
the body of light.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.630 align:middle line:84%
There are many traditions
that talk about this process.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
In the Tibetan and
Eastern traditions,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:84%
there's the idea of the rainbow
body, or the great perfection.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.750 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalistic tradition,
we talk about the Adam Kadmon,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.040 align:middle line:90%
the perfected human.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:84%
The ancient and secret
Kabbalistic science

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:84%
of building the
Merkabah, an ascension

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.040 align:middle line:84%
vehicle for our transformation,
is still practiced today,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
although it is not what many
in the new age think it to be.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:84%
Some even talk
about the apotheosis

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
of George Washington,
which is intriguing,

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.520 align:middle line:84%
as we know many of the founding
fathers of the United States

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
studied with an initiatory
path with true lineage roots

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
in the Western Mystery
School tradition.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:10%
And then alchemy talks about
the Philosopher's Stone

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.200 align:middle line:10%
as the culmination
of the great work.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.220 align:middle line:10%
Hermes Trismegistus
called himself

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:10%
thrice great because he
fully attained the three

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:10%
parts of the philosophy
of the whole world,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:10%
meaning the perfection of
the body, soul, and spirit.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:84%
What is the scientific basis
for this transformation

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
of the physical body
into a light body?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
The key is within
the quantum physics

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and atomic
consciousness, where we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
can learn to tap
into what alchemists

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:90%
called The Secret Fire.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the core
essence of source

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.940 align:middle line:84%
as it flows into our
physical atoms and DNA.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
This source in the physical is
within our own consciousness.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:10%
Modern-day alchemist
Dennis William Hauck

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:10%
says, "The alchemists
believed that the driving

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.390 align:middle line:10%
force behind the
evolution of matter,

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:10%
the connection between the
mental and physical reality,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:10%
was fire."

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:84%
This fire must operate
at the quantum level

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:90%
within the zero point field.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
In essence, alchemists sought
to harness the secret fire,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that power of higher
consciousness,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.730 align:middle line:84%
in order to access
the central fire

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.080 align:middle line:84%
or divine spark within
matter and draw it out.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
They believed that
through this process,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.860 align:middle line:84%
they could transform matter into
its ultimate perfected state.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:84%
If we can learn to achieve
a coherent state of being

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and have a daily practice
with meditation every day,

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.320 align:middle line:84%
we can activate more and more
of that secret fire within.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.950 align:middle line:84%
This then draws to it what we
can call the celestial fire

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.820 align:middle line:84%
or light that is the smallest
particle of consciousness

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:90%
from source.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.950 align:middle line:84%
This is the smallest
building block of matter.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.190 align:middle line:84%
It is at the central
core of every atom.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.899 align:middle line:84%
And this particle
of consciousness

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:90%
is within the nuclei.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:84%
It acts as a portal through
which divine consciousness

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
enters into manifestation.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
It is the essence of
source in this world.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It has the seed of
divinity within it.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
This seed is something that we,
as conscious and aware beings,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
can tap into using our own
secret fire of consciousness

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:90%
to reach it.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.710 align:middle line:10%
As we achieve a state
of coherence within,

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.960 align:middle line:10%
we raise our
vibration and activate

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:10%
that secret fire of our
own quantum consciousness.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:10%
We begin to then draw
into us more and more

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:10%
of the celestial fire, more
light from the universe.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:84%
And as it begins to accumulate
within us over time,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
this transmutes our physical
body into a body of light.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
What are the indicators
are signs that ascension

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.100 align:middle line:90%
is starting to happen?

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, to begin with,
we may experience

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.230 align:middle line:84%
what could be called
symptoms of ascension.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:84%
As the light particles
come in, they hit densities

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.630 align:middle line:90%
within our body and soul.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And these densities
may block the light

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.150 align:middle line:84%
or have difficulty
interacting with it.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
These can be physical,
mental, and emotional toxins

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:90%
or blockages.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
The light begins to break
down these densities little

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:90%
by little.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Some of these toxins
that pollute our system

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
may have become
buried deep within

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and are currently
in a passive state.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And as that breakdown
process starts,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.060 align:middle line:84%
it moves them into
a more active state,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
bringing them to the surface to
be eliminated from the system.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Physical toxins may get
flushed into the bloodstream

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
or other systems of
elimination within the body.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
But at the emotional
level, things

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.885 align:middle line:90%
unearth from the subconscious.

00:06:07.885 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And we may start to feel
the emotion rise up.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:84%
We may not know why we're
feeling that emotion,

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:90%
but we are.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It's like a detoxing or
catharsis, a healing process,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
where we first have to feel in
order to choose to let it go.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And at the mental
level, we may also

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:84%
have belief systems come
up into our awareness.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:84%
We may ask, is this
true for me anymore?

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We become aware of
our belief systems

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and begin to question
them and make new choices.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And with any of these processes,
there's always a choice.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:90%
We can suppress or address it.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And we can let it keep
moving out of the system.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
With the physical detox,
we may also feel symptoms

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.660 align:middle line:84%
like headaches or nausea,
fatigue, or what we sometimes

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:90%
call density drops.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.640 align:middle line:10%
The body is physically
trying to fight off a toxin

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:10%
and eliminate it
from the system.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to when
we catch a cold,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and the body's immune system
is trying to fight it off.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And in these cases,
we need to make

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:84%
the right choices that support
our physical healing process.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Rather than ignoring
the physical feelings

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.050 align:middle line:84%
or masking it with drugs
or other addictions,

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:90%
we should listen to the body.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's telling us to slow
down, rest, drink more water,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
or load up on those vitamins
and minerals and herbs

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:90%
that will help you get well.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Only when we give our
body what it really

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
needs to heal and
become stronger can

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.355 align:middle line:84%
it push out whatever
the toxin is.

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And with ascension, we
are raising our vibration

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:90%
within our physical body.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So we want to avoid things
that have denser vibrations

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
or that alter our consciousness
in a way that's not controlled

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and coherent application
of the right tools.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Things like drugs, alcohol,
cigarettes, and the like

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.050 align:middle line:84%
can interfere with the
process of ascension.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
In order to ascend, we must
access higher consciousness

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
by creating a sustainable way
for our own inner alchemical

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.250 align:middle line:84%
process, rather than relying on
external sources to shift us.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:84%
It's really about eliminating
the denser vibrations

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and things that weigh
down our system.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.260 align:middle line:84%
We also have to go
through the healing

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.810 align:middle line:84%
process for emotional
and mental trauma.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.810 align:middle line:84%
These are also
toxins to the soul

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.199 align:middle line:84%
and create energy blocks
within our aura and mind.

00:08:33.199 --> 00:08:34.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes the
emotions can be

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
stored within the organs
or the tissues of the body.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.169 align:middle line:84%
Mental belief systems can create
blockages of the perceptions.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
the things that we

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.600 align:middle line:84%
need to work on clearing
in order to ascend.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it will require
a level of discipline.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't mean that
life will be boring.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Living the Middle
Pillar lifestyle,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
like what we're
talking about here,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
is full of joy, clear awareness,
greater consciousness,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:84%
True ascension is a process
that becomes a lifestyle.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to access
a broad spectrum of vibrations

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.400 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can have
a weekend experience,

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and we can have a peak moment
during that type of experience.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
we've integrated it

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:24.440 align:middle line:84%
into our life as our new
foundation or base for life.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Ascension is about
raising our baseline

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:84%
through a cyclic
process that we call

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
the evolving triangle of
knowledge, understanding,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
We progress and serve through
this process over and over

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And as we do, it
raises our baseline,

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
bringing the physical
up to higher levels.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
We can have many peak moments
as we go through this process.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.970 align:middle line:84%
But even more important
is that as we continue

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:84%
to follow this
process of ascension,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
the more our new low
points will be higher

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.170 align:middle line:90%
than our previous high points.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
the high points

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:90%
will also reach new heights.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:84%
So what is the evolving triangle
of knowledge, understanding,

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.257 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom?

00:10:09.257 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
This teaching comes from
the Modern Mystery School

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and is something that I have
directly experienced as true.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a powerful way to
live a meaningful life.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It's also called the Hermetic
Science of Ascension.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with knowledge.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:90%
What do we mean by knowledge?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's about seeking
new information that will

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.470 align:middle line:90%
help us to grow and progress.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:10%
But knowledge must be
applied if it's going

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:10%
to lead towards progression.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
We won't know it
until we live it

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:90%
and integrate it into our lives.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.340 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge for the
sake of knowledge

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.180 align:middle line:90%
won't get us anywhere.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But knowledge that
can be applied to life

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and lead to progression--
that's what we're seeking.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most important
knowledge is that of the self.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:90%
What are our gifts?

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.030 align:middle line:90%
What is our purpose?

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the knowledge
we should be seeking.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And rather than having
the concept or idea of it,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
we must apply it
through application.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:90%
We grow in our learning.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.980 align:middle line:90%
We refine, and we get results.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.430 align:middle line:10%
Then we can always course
correct if we're not

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:10%
applying it in the right way.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.670 align:middle line:10%
And from this process, we then
come to greater understanding

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:10%
of what was once a concept.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.190 align:middle line:10%
We ultimately come to
master it for ourselves.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:10%
From here, in order
to continue forward,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:10%
we have to take
that understanding

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:10%
and now strive towards wisdom.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:84%
What gets us from
understanding to wisdom?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.520 align:middle line:84%
What can take us beyond
our personal understanding?

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.810 align:middle line:90%
We've already applied it.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:90%
We've integrated it.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:90%
And we're living it.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And this brought us
to understanding.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.120 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that can take
us further now and raise

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
our vibration up
to wisdom is now

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
stepping into an
active role of service,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.990 align:middle line:90%
serving with what we understand.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.260 align:middle line:84%
If we have knowledge and
start teaching the information

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.920 align:middle line:84%
without understanding, then we
won't have a strong foundation

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.330 align:middle line:90%
to stand on.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to work with it for a
while through selfless service.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:84%
Service is what raises our
vibration up to higher planes

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:90%
to reach wisdom.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.880 align:middle line:90%
What is service?

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, service is
about helping others

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
remember and progress toward
their full divine potential.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are steps
in this process.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.100 align:middle line:10%
The first three steps
include service to self,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:10%
service to others, and service
to God or the greater whole.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And we start with
service to self, which

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%
is about our own physical life.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.570 align:middle line:84%
It's about having joy in
life, taking care of our body,

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:84%
doing what we need
to fill our cup.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's not from a place
of selfishness, though.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Rather, we serve ourselves
and fill our own cup

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
so that we can truly serve
others more sustainably.

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:10%
And from our overflow, we
serve and flow to others.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.690 align:middle line:84%
When we're not
serving ourselves,

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and we try to do so
much for other people,

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:90%
we can get depleted.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And when this
happens, we won't be

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
able to sustain service
for the bigger picture

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:90%
or in the long run.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we have to
serve ourselves first.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
But we shouldn't
wait until we're

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:84%
100% good and perfect before
we start to serve others.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.810 align:middle line:84%
When we step into
service to others

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.520 align:middle line:84%
from a place of selflessness,
from love and honor,

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.060 align:middle line:84%
rather than from any kind
of agenda or obligation,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.770 align:middle line:84%
when we do it from
the right place,

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
we feel full of light,
joy, and love from feeling

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.670 align:middle line:90%
connected to our own divinity.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.790 align:middle line:10%
And we want to then help
others remember their divinity

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.110 align:middle line:10%
and feel that love, joy,
and connection as well.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And when we are full of love,
all we want to do is give.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.050 align:middle line:84%
And we have plenty
of energy to do so.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Service to others is
about fulfilling our soul.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We actively pull the
light into us from source,

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and this fills us.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
From our overflow,
we then flow it

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:84%
to whoever we are in
active service to.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
This process raises
our vibration

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
because the light is filling us
as we are flowing it to others.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the method
of how we raise

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.430 align:middle line:90%
our vibration through service.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.880 align:middle line:84%
However, for it
to truly work, we

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
can't be doing it
for our own sake.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.740 align:middle line:84%
It has to be for
a higher purpose,

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to benefit the greater whole.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.970 align:middle line:84%
This then brings us to service
to the spirit or the divine.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.630 align:middle line:90%
It is the great work.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.930 align:middle line:90%
It's about a bigger purpose.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.530 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer just serving
one individual or small groups

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:90%
of people.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a mission of
helping create a better

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.800 align:middle line:84%
world, a world of peace, truly
helping humanity to awaken,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:90%
to be a part of the shift.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I as an individual am not
going to be the one who

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.140 align:middle line:90%
does this on my own.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But I can be a part of
helping the collective

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:90%
to awaken and ascend.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Being part of a
mission that is aligned

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
with creating a world
of peace and balance,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that fulfills our
spirit and brings joy.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And along that path of
service, as we grow,

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.900 align:middle line:84%
our capacity to
serve also grows.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
As we serve with
that new capacity,

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:90%
we also feel stretched.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.470 align:middle line:84%
So we still have to be
serving ourselves, which

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:90%
allows us to continue growing.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
This then becomes
a feedback loop.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:90%
We grow as we serve.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:84%
We raise our
vibration as we serve.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're not
just learning from

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.190 align:middle line:84%
our own personal application
and the results of our own life

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:01.790 align:middle line:84%
but also through the
reflection of those we serve.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Through service, we gain
a deeper and different

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.010 align:middle line:84%
perspective because
the needs of others

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.500 align:middle line:90%
are different from our own.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we integrate in a
new way and learn a more

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
universal application through
the dynamic reflection

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.540 align:middle line:90%
of others.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:10%
And through this process
we grow beyond ourselves

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.120 align:middle line:10%
and our own perspectives.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
This is what brings us to
ultimately gain wisdom.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:10%
And once we've achieved
wisdom, have we then arrived?

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:84%
The wise man knows
he knows nothing.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:10%
So he or she always
adapts an attitude

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.310 align:middle line:10%
of the beginner's mind.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.610 align:middle line:10%
We empty our cup, remain
humble, and continue

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:10%
to seek new knowledge
in new areas

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.690 align:middle line:10%
so we can continue
to grow and progress.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.930 align:middle line:84%
When someone climbs the mountain
top, and they're at the peak,

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%
they have this incredible vista.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:84%
But at the peak,
they then realize

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
there's all these other
mountains to climb.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:90%
They see how much more there is.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So they go back down,
empty their cup,

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
and seek the next mountain
to begin a new climb.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:84%
We are never so good that
we can't become better.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
It is so important
that we empty our cup.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:84%
If we try to stay on top of
the mountain, we stop growing.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.460 align:middle line:90%
We stop flowing.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:90%
We stagnate.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.550 align:middle line:90%
We must stay humble.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Confident and
strong, yet humble.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.320 align:middle line:84%
And we can remind
ourselves that we

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:90%
don't know what we don't know.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
There is always more
room for growth.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Thus, with the
beginner's mind, we

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.010 align:middle line:84%
seek new knowledge
and progression.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Even while we empty
our cup, we can never

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.290 align:middle line:84%
go back to where we were
before because we've

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:90%
grown through the cycle.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.200 align:middle line:84%
We know and understand
more, and we are wiser.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Our baseline is
now at a new place.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So we seek new knowledge,
apply it, and progress.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And through this, we
gain more understanding.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Then we step into
active service.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And through that service,
we gain further wisdom.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:90%
We see that there's more.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So we empty our cup, stay
humble, and seek new knowledge.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And we begin anew to
climb the next mountain.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And this cycle goes on and
on and on, without end.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Our true potential is infinite.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And we are on an eternal
journey of our spirit,

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.780 align:middle line:84%
to become fully realized
in our infinite potential.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
From the human perspective,
it may seem overwhelming

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:84%
that this process
is never-ending.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
But from the Spirit's
perspective, we are eternal.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And it gets easier and easier
the more we do the cycle.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a way of life.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
The key is to not
allowing the ego

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to get attached to
being the person

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:90%
at the top of the mountain.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
As the Hermetic principle
of vibration says,

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:90%
everything moves.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.360 align:middle line:90%
Everything vibrates.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:90%
There is no standing still.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:10%
There is only movement
forwards or backwards,

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.910 align:middle line:10%
progressing or regressing.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.890 align:middle line:84%
This ancient Hermetic
science of ascension

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.250 align:middle line:84%
shows us how we keep
moving forward--

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:84%
progressing, ascending,
and raising our baseline.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.440 align:middle line:84%
The art is in how
we apply it, how

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
we uniquely live
it and express it,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
serving in our own unique
way by harnessing our gifts

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.550 align:middle line:90%
and potentials that are ours.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Thus, along the way, we have
to come to know ourselves more,

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:84%
to know our unique gifts
and way of expressing.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We also must overcome
our fears and the places

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%
where we might
sabotage ourselves,

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.080 align:middle line:84%
where we don't really feel
worthy or good enough.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Through this process, we come
to greater levels of recognition

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:90%
that we are all one.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.450 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:58.590 align:middle line:84%
If I am attaining higher levels
but my brother and sister are

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:90%
not, we're not going to ascend.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.750 align:middle line:90%
We have to do this together.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:90%
It's all of us or none of us.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Thus, we serve.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
The more we serve ourselves
and others as divine beings,

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.850 align:middle line:84%
as embodiments of
divine consciousness,

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.030 align:middle line:84%
the more we draw in the
light, the celestial fire,

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.850 align:middle line:84%
of the alchemists,
and we transform

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:90%
into that body of light.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Where are we as a collective
in this process of ascension?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And where do we go from here?

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:84%
To answer that, let's
orient ourselves.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In our human experience, we
have multi-dimensionality.

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a common
thought among the new age

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
movement that talks
about ascension

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.860 align:middle line:90%
into the fifth dimension.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.590 align:middle line:84%
What are we really
talking about?

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:49.320 align:middle line:84%
It's actually more like
levels of expanded states

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.410 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and
vibration, rather than

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.410 align:middle line:90%
physical spacetime dimensions.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Mystery
School teachings say

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.960 align:middle line:84%
there are 12 dimensional levels
within the physical and 7

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:90%
spiritual levels.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.903 align:middle line:84%
And within each of these
levels are many sublevels.

00:21:05.903 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the Modern
Mystery School teachings,

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.370 align:middle line:84%
we say that the first physical
dimension of consciousness

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:84%
would be like the consciousness
of the elements of Earth,

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:90%
water, air, and fire.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we could think of
the consciousness of a rock

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:84%
from the mineral
kingdom as an example.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:84%
With the second
dimension, we describe

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:29.230 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of plants,
the plant kingdom as a whole,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
as well as some of
the animal kingdom.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
At this level, things take
on a group consciousness.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know that
the trees of a forest

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.730 align:middle line:90%
are really more like one entity.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:84%
They are all connected
under the soil

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.140 align:middle line:90%
through their root systems.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, animals in the wild
tend to run in herds and packs

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and flocks--

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.670 align:middle line:90%
again, operating as a unit.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the third
dimension of consciousness,

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
we begin to evolve more towards
individuated consciousness.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.010 align:middle line:84%
For example, domesticated
animals are given names.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.160 align:middle line:84%
They are treated as
individuals by humans.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:10%
And they often can take on
the personality attributes

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:10%
of their owners, yet they
still often exhibit a loyalty

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.340 align:middle line:10%
to their pack or their family.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Certain primitive
humans of the past,

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
who lived much more
simply than we do today,

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and who were primarily focused
on just a connection to nature,

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
they were also of a third
dimensional consciousness,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
meaning their existence
was usually in relation

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.730 align:middle line:90%
to being part of the tribe.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
They might have been very
spiritual and in-tune but not

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
so complex in their
mental frameworks

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:84%
as we are today, with all of
our science and technology

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:90%
and multifaceted systems.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the majority
of humanity evolved

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:84%
into the fourth dimension
of consciousness,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.490 align:middle line:90%
things became more complex.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:90%
We started to engage the mind.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:84%
We developed more advanced
arts and sciences.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
Abstract thinking
became overlaid

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.080 align:middle line:84%
on top of our emotional
levels of being.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And we also started focusing
on ourselves as individuals.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.880 align:middle line:84%
In our modern-day society,
most of the masses

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.610 align:middle line:84%
are still operating at this
fourth-dimensional level

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.110 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.090 align:middle line:84%
How do we evolve
from here to get

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to the next stage
of development?

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.380 align:middle line:84%
To answer that,
let's take a look

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:28.100 align:middle line:84%
at how we evolve
individually for a moment.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Each of us go through all
of the first four stages

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:90%
in our own development.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:38.020 align:middle line:84%
As our physical body is
growing and wiring itself,

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and our soul is being programmed
through the early stages

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:84%
of life, from infancy to
childhood to our teenage years

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:84%
into adulthood, we traverse
through these dimensions

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:90%
or levels of consciousness.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
A baby is fully focused on
stimulation from the five

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:58.540 align:middle line:84%
senses and interacting
with the elements,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.080 align:middle line:84%
feeling the air blowing on its
face or the warmth of the body

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:90%
and needing to eat.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.640 align:middle line:84%
This is a very physical
level of awareness,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:84%
a first-dimensional
consciousness.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:84%
A child starts to become
more attentive to the things

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
outside, out in the
garden, in nature.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We might have an
awareness of the fairy

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:90%
kingdom or imaginary friends.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.800 align:middle line:84%
To children, the
plants are alive.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Objects become alive,
and we can talk to them.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Adults may call it make-believe,
but children operate mostly

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
at a theta brainwave
level, a level

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.950 align:middle line:84%
where we can more
easily connect to spirit

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.990 align:middle line:90%
with our consciousness.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:84%
But then when we get
into our pre-teen years,

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
we enter the
third-dimensional stage

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.020 align:middle line:90%
of our conscious development.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Here we become self-conscious
about our social status

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.200 align:middle line:90%
among peers or our tribe.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And it is a very emotional time
in our developmental process.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:84%
We operate more on instincts,
impulses, and emotions,

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:03.870 align:middle line:84%
rather than reason, intellect,
or executive functioning.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:84%
The fourth-dimensional
consciousness,

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.430 align:middle line:84%
though, is then related
to our teenage years,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:84%
as we enter into high
school, and all the way

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.930 align:middle line:90%
into our early 20s.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Here we're learning
more abstract concepts.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:84%
We develop our logic capacities
and our mental constructs.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And on top of our
emotional life,

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.540 align:middle line:84%
we become more multi-dimensional
in our operations as a result.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, the higher we go
in these dimensions,

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.300 align:middle line:84%
the more complexity, the
more multi-dimensionality

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.470 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness is able to
perceive, consolidate, and make

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.970 align:middle line:90%
sense of.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this stage, the majority
of human thought and human ways

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.660 align:middle line:84%
of being on the
planet today are still

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
operating in the
fourth-dimensional state

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:84%
We've become a bit
stuck as a collective.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.950 align:middle line:84%
If we still lived in
a spiritual society,

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.860 align:middle line:84%
our education system would
be very different than what

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:90%
we have today.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:84%
It would include spiritual
wisdom and understanding

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.900 align:middle line:84%
of mythologies and
archetypal forces.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But instead, in our
materially-driven, utilitarian

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:13.660 align:middle line:84%
world, our education
and programming

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:84%
has become about
what's practical

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and what will make us
become a good participant

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:90%
in our social system.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.490 align:middle line:84%
What's needed is a balance
between spiritual wisdom

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.590 align:middle line:90%
and physical practicality.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Were meant to be going beyond
this fourth-dimensional way

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.520 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And if our society and
education were more balanced,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
we would naturally progress
to the fifth-dimensional

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:40.150 align:middle line:84%
consciousness by the
time we are in our 20s.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And what do we mean here
by a fifth-dimensional

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.140 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, the fifth dimension
is about archetypes.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's an awareness
of the archetypes,

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:53.560 align:middle line:84%
such as astrological cycles of
the sun, the moon, the stars

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and how they influence us, plus
an awareness of the archetypes

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.470 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness, how
they show up in our books

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and movies, in our lives
and our relationships

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
with other people, an awareness
of asking the question, what

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.900 align:middle line:90%
archetype am I?

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Or what combination
of archetypes

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:84%
do I tend to fulfill
in the lives of others?

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.090 align:middle line:84%
This fifth-dimensional
awareness is

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be the
result of our education.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.970 align:middle line:10%
But unfortunately,
since we're not

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:10%
living in a spiritual society
that passes on universal wisdom

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.430 align:middle line:10%
to the next
generation, we're not

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:32.050 align:middle line:10%
getting the kind of education
we really need to advance.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.120 align:middle line:10%
When people step onto
a path of seeking

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:10%
light and deeper
knowledge, they do

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.490 align:middle line:10%
start exploring this
archetypal awareness.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Examples can include astrology,
tarot, numerology, Kabbalah,

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:84%
and various mythologies
and cosmologies

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:84%
from ancient mystery
traditions of the world.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
These all offer windows
into this archetypal way

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.610 align:middle line:90%
of viewing things.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.980 align:middle line:84%
This step into the
fifth-dimensional state

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness is
part of our progression

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:90%
to become spiritual adults.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Physically, we might
be adults, and we may

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:90%
have advanced our knowledge.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But emotionally and
spiritually, most of humanity

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:11.530 align:middle line:84%
is stuck in that
fourth dimension.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Some are even stuck in the
third-dimensional consciousness

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.690 align:middle line:84%
due to unresolved
traumas in youth

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:84%
or because of improper
education and programming.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Yet now, in our adulthood,
through re-educating ourselves

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and through committing
to our healing journey,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.430 align:middle line:84%
we can resolve
these lower levels

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.610 align:middle line:84%
and give ourselves the platform
that we need to progress

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and ascend to higher
levels of consciousness.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.060 align:middle line:84%
The key is that we
focus on progressing,

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:45.310 align:middle line:84%
both physically and
spiritually, in a balanced way.

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:84%
If we are so focused on just
our physical life and not

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.760 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual, we may
progress physically.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
But we might feel
poor spiritually.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.300 align:middle line:84%
We may have physical wealth,
but something inside is missing.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.090 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if we
progressed spiritually,

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:05.340 align:middle line:84%
but we're neglecting
ourselves physically,

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.410 align:middle line:84%
we won't attain
our full potential

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:90%
at the physical level.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:84%
This happens when we
are trying to escape

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
our physicality, for
example, instead of living

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.320 align:middle line:90%
in this physical life.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:84%
We must balance both if we
are to master ourselves.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:84%
We should be manifesting
our full potential

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.830 align:middle line:84%
When we do, things like money
are no longer a limitation.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Resources and the ability
to make things happen

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.690 align:middle line:90%
are at our disposal.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.840 align:middle line:84%
They no longer pose
limitations for us.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Rather than hanging
out in fantasy land,

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
we know how to
make things happen

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.500 align:middle line:84%
to manifest at the
physical levels,

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.430 align:middle line:84%
yet in a way that is aligned
with spiritual purpose.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:51.750 align:middle line:84%
To do so, we must harness both
spiritual and physical sides

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:90%
of life in balance.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.120 align:middle line:84%
As we progress in this
ability, we eventually

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:84%
come to the sixth-dimensional
level of consciousness.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The sixth dimension is conscious
awareness of the higher self.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, people on a spiritual
path often access

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.150 align:middle line:90%
this level of awareness.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:84%
But the question is whether we
are living as our higher self.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
If so, our full-time job
would be fully aligned

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.030 align:middle line:84%
with our purpose in life,
not just a side thing

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:90%
to pursue when we have the time.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.580 align:middle line:84%
We'd be coming from our
higher self in our perspective

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.430 align:middle line:84%
and how we behave in
situations, rather than

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:90%
from egoic reactions.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, ego will always be there,
no matter how far we progress.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So long as we are physical,
we will have an ego.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we have to learn
to keep it in check.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the sixth
dimension is really

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.710 align:middle line:84%
just the halfway point on the
various levels of attainment.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They keep on going to higher
and higher levels of mastery

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.140 align:middle line:90%
and expanded awareness.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The higher we
attain, the more we

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.910 align:middle line:84%
should be able to also
manifest and express

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.430 align:middle line:84%
our full potential
into the physical

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:04.360 align:middle line:84%
through abundance, by bringing
hope, being in service,

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.580 align:middle line:84%
harnessing the powers
of the universe,

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and creating whatever it is
we set our will to create.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:15.310 align:middle line:84%
The highest level of awareness,
the 12th physical dimension,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:84%
is about oneness
with divine source,

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.870 align:middle line:84%
or oneness with all that is,
operating wholly and completely

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.970 align:middle line:90%
in the Agape love.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.640 align:middle line:84%
This 12th-dimensional
level of consciousness

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:32.380 align:middle line:84%
is fully tapped into the
Agape, living that oneness

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.000 align:middle line:90%
with our divinity.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Not from a place of ego but
from a place of pure awareness,

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.920 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we are
worthy, that we are divine.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Few people on our
planet really, truly

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.660 align:middle line:84%
ever attain such
a level to date.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But this is the level we
are capable of attaining

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and our one-day
prophecy to reach.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.350 align:middle line:84%
It is what the
Kabbalists call the Adam

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Kadmon, or the
perfected, godlike human,

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.350 align:middle line:84%
with a fully
transfigured light body

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and fully emanating
the vibration of love.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:09.400 align:middle line:84%
That is ascension to the
highest level of consciousness.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.340 align:middle line:10%
And it is attainable while
in the physical body.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:17.710 align:middle line:84%
This is what is spoken of
as the Philosopher's Stone.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.350 align:middle line:84%
As the Emerald Tablets
of Hermes describe,

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.740 align:middle line:84%
"Therefore, let all
obscurity flee before thee.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the strong
fortitude of all fortitudes,

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:30.010 align:middle line:84%
overcoming every subtle
thing and penetrating

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:90%
every solid thing."

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the attainment of
merging with our immortality,

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:41.260 align:middle line:84%
merging our physical body
with our eternal spirit.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:84%
It is the state of a
transfigured light body

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.770 align:middle line:84%
with no more impurities
or densities in the system

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:90%
that cause death or decay.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.920 align:middle line:90%
This is the ultimate level.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.920 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, we're still

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
operating at that
fourth-dimensional level.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.450 align:middle line:90%
And we have a ways to go.

00:32:58.450 --> 00:33:01.630 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, though, there is
a growing collective of people

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:10%
who are on a
spiritual path, that

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:06.490 align:middle line:10%
are living at that
fifth dimension, or even

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:10%
the sixth-dimensional levels
of consciousness already.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
They are helping lead the way
for the greater collective

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:90%
to also make this shift.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.580 align:middle line:90%
So what is our goal?

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Our goal would be, ultimately,
that 12th-dimensional level

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:25.540 align:middle line:84%
of unity, consciousness,
and Agape love.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.980 align:middle line:84%
We have the chance to move the
direction of the collective.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But this depends on
how much we implement

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.320 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual practice,
while also integrating it

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.850 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Not just living on the
mountaintop or monastery

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.640 align:middle line:90%
but immersing ourselves in life.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.280 align:middle line:84%
The world as a
collective is not going

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to ascend unless we do it
together at some level.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:52.660 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to be in
the world, integrating

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.640 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual practice
and philosophy

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.640 align:middle line:84%
into our physical
life and society.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Through this process, we bring
heaven and earth together.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:84%
If we as a collective
can shift, if we

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:84%
can make the leap from
the fourth-dimensional

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:11.500 align:middle line:84%
consciousness just up to the
sixth dimension, where everyone

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.639 align:middle line:84%
is fulfilling their
unique purpose

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.850 align:middle line:84%
and aligned with
their higher self,

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that's all we'd need
to create Shambala,

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:22.360 align:middle line:84%
or what we would call a
world of peace and balance.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And those who are leading
the way by living the way

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:84%
and being true to
that way, they're

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:30.580 align:middle line:84%
the ones to climb to the
higher levels of attainment

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:90%
beyond the sixth dimension.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.219 align:middle line:84%
How can a relatively
small group of individuals

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:39.274 align:middle line:84%
help to shift the
global collective?

00:34:39.274 --> 00:34:41.880 align:middle line:10%
Well, as Margaret
Mead famously said,

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.150 align:middle line:10%
"Never doubt that a small
group of thoughtful, committed

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.679 align:middle line:10%
citizens can change the world.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.145 align:middle line:10%
Indeed, it's the only
thing that ever has."

00:34:50.145 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, scientific
research confirms

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that only a small
percentage of the population

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:84%
is needed to shift
into a coherent state.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Once a critical
mass of coherence

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.880 align:middle line:84%
has been achieved and sustained
by the small percentage

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.310 align:middle line:84%
of people, then the
rest of the collective

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.910 align:middle line:84%
can spontaneously attune
to this new level.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.270 align:middle line:10%
Intention experiments using
random number generators

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:10%
conducted by the Princeton
Engineering Anomalies Research

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:22.830 align:middle line:10%
team concluded that, "With a
sufficiently large community

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:26.940 align:middle line:10%
of individuals or organisms
in resonance with each other

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:10%
and with a common purpose,
the cumulative impact

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.080 align:middle line:10%
on the manifest physical
and cognitive domains

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:36.780 align:middle line:10%
becomes significant
and measurable."

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We can speculate on what that
critical mass number may be.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
For sure, I believe it
will be less than 3%

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.940 align:middle line:90%
of the world population.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Some predictions narrow
this critical number

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:57.830 align:middle line:84%
even further to be the square
root of 1% of the population.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.190 align:middle line:84%
If this critical number
of people across the world

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.130 align:middle line:84%
dedicate themselves to
their spiritual growth

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and sustainably achieve
those coherent states

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.130 align:middle line:84%
by integrating with
their higher self

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and living their life purpose,
that sixth-dimensional level

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.780 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, we will
successfully make this shift

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:19.670 align:middle line:90%
as a collective.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
These dedicated
souls are the trail

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.400 align:middle line:84%
blazers who have the courage
and devotion to doing

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.020 align:middle line:90%
the great work.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.120 align:middle line:84%
As individuals,
these people likely

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.090 align:middle line:84%
will feel that they don't fit
in with the rest of the world.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:35.750 align:middle line:10%
But as they find each
other and bond together

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.240 align:middle line:10%
as a spiritual family
of lightworkers,

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.810 align:middle line:10%
uniting in one mission,
they will find strength

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.200 align:middle line:10%
in each other.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:84%
This is why working together in
groups versus just on one's own

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
can have an enhanced effect
on the coherence field.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.510 align:middle line:84%
When we also add to this
effort true initiation

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:55.790 align:middle line:84%
into the ancient
Mystery School lineages,

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:84%
the impact on the
collective becomes even more

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.360 align:middle line:84%
amplified and accelerated,
with 10 times, 100 times, even

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:90%
1,000 times the power.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:08.030 align:middle line:84%
When we can get this critical
mass of people, those

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:84%
who are dedicated
to doing the work

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.380 align:middle line:84%
for personal and
spiritual mastery,

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.230 align:middle line:84%
we will tip the scales
towards the awakening

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.750 align:middle line:90%
of the collective.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.160 align:middle line:84%
The masses will then
intuitively start

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.945 align:middle line:84%
to entrain into these new
levels of consciousness.

00:37:22.945 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And those who are
leading the charge

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:84%
will continue to lead
as we then implement

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:84%
these new levels
of consciousness

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.730 align:middle line:90%
to create a better world.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:84%
From a Kabbalistic
perspective, humanity

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is currently standing at the
edge of what we call the abyss.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.900 align:middle line:90%
The abyss is about separation.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.860 align:middle line:84%
Here, we are faced with our
fears, our limiting structures

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.560 align:middle line:84%
that don't work anymore,
and the things that need

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.350 align:middle line:90%
to be changed or let go of.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:84%
This point on our collective
journey is a perilous one.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It can be confusing
and tumultuous,

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.980 align:middle line:84%
with many doubts and
fears that can arise here.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And the keys to ascending
across the abyss

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:07.340 align:middle line:84%
safely and successfully
include things

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.640 align:middle line:84%
like moving beyond
ideas of separation

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.970 align:middle line:84%
into unity and divinity,
walking forward

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:18.110 align:middle line:84%
in faith and humbleness,
cutting away the old to create

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:23.660 align:middle line:84%
room for the new, having the
courage, love, and trust to let

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:90%
go of what no longer serves.

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
point of reclaiming

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.100 align:middle line:84%
the true self, our
true potential,

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.710 align:middle line:84%
reuniting with our
divinity, and recognizing

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.960 align:middle line:90%
that we are all one.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the precipice we
are at, the great leap

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:44.990 align:middle line:84%
in human consciousness and
our collective evolution.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.790 align:middle line:84%
What can we do right now
to be part of this shift?

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:54.260 align:middle line:84%
First, we must build up our
light body, our ascension

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.730 align:middle line:90%
vehicle.

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Many consider this to be the
star tetrahedron Merkabah.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.280 align:middle line:84%
But the deeper
teachings from Kabbalah

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.550 align:middle line:84%
offer us a different
perspective.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:08.000 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective of
pure sacred geometry,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.690 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of all things
is based on the triangle,

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.420 align:middle line:90%
the square, and the circle.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.600 align:middle line:84%
As we expand these
from 2D to 3D,

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.340 align:middle line:84%
they become the pyramid,
the cube, and the sphere.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:84%
These three geometries,
when stacked

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:28.130 align:middle line:84%
one on top of the other, with
the sphere at the bottom,

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:31.040 align:middle line:84%
the cube in the middle,
and the pyramid at the top,

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.360 align:middle line:84%
become the outer form of the
three-dimensional tree of life.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This three-dimensional
tree of life

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:42.260 align:middle line:84%
is the outer scaffolding
that is our true Merkabah.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.440 align:middle line:84%
This is something we have
to build up within us.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.360 align:middle line:84%
The art and science
of how to do this

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.450 align:middle line:84%
properly is something we do
through the universal Kabbalah

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:90%
system of the Mystery School.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But for now, let's begin
by visualizing the lower

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
half of the body immersed in
a sphere from the waist down.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Then imagine a cube from the
waist up to the shoulders.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And finally, see a
pyramid covering the head.

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Start with this visualization,
holding it strongly

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:19.100 align:middle line:84%
within the mind for
30 minutes per day.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:84%
After one month of stabilizing
the outer scaffolding,

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:27.050 align:middle line:84%
begin bringing in the details
now of the tree of life,

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.270 align:middle line:90%
working from the bottom up.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.510 align:middle line:84%
Start first with the
two-dimensional tree.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And then over time,
build up to working

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.462 align:middle line:90%
with the three-dimensional tree.

00:40:37.462 --> 00:40:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, proper knowledge
is important.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:44.460 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't apply it in
our lives, nothing will change.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Applying the knowledge
requires the right keys,

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.800 align:middle line:84%
which the path of
initiation gives us.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.550 align:middle line:84%
We have the tools to really help
us achieve this coherent states

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.920 align:middle line:90%
and accelerate our evolution.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Using the tools that are
going to work effectively

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.510 align:middle line:90%
takes commitment.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:02.610 align:middle line:84%
It also asks us to
do the work on behalf

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:06.750 align:middle line:84%
