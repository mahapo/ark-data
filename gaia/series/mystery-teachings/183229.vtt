00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:10%
To truly access
our full capacity

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.920 align:middle line:10%
requires that we retrain and
rewire our nervous system

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.590 align:middle line:10%
for more optimal functioning.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
To get a better feel for this,
let's use a computer analogy.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Imagine for a moment that
the hardware of a computer

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.060 align:middle line:90%
is like the body.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.980 align:middle line:84%
Its circuitry and wiring are
akin to the nervous system.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Its main processing
chip is like our brain.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And now imagine that the
operating system and software,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:84%
with all its application
and data files,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.800 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to our
individual mind and soul.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the user is our
spirit or higher intelligence,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
which is connected to
the mind of the all.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
our mind and soul

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
function as the interface
or mediator between the body

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and the spirit.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:90%
If our software, a.k.a.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:84%
our mind, has bugs or
faulty programming,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
then we're going
to have problems.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
This means that our
goal is twofold.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:10%
First, to debug the programming
of the mind, and second,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:10%
to optimize the circuitry of the
brain and neurological system.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Only then will we be able to
expand our conscious awareness

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.620 align:middle line:90%
of who and what we truly are.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
As spiritual beings
having a physical life,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than thinking
of ourselves

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:84%
as physical beings first who
are now on a spiritual journey.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's remember that we are
spirit first and foremost.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And we are here to live a
fully awakened physical life.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.380 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
begin diving into how

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.000 align:middle line:84%
we can rewire our brain
and nervous system

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.456 align:middle line:84%
for more optimal functioning
in this experience of life.

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:15.280 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.940 align:middle line:84%
How is it even possible to
rewire our system as adults?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It's possible
because of something

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.970 align:middle line:90%
called neuroplasticity.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.420 align:middle line:84%
This exciting
discovery was actually

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.410 align:middle line:84%
made by neuroscientists
starting as early as the 1800s.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that time, it was
believed that the brain

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:90%
was hardwired by the age of 25.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But since the '70s,
scientists have

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
continued to discover just
how adaptable our brain

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.620 align:middle line:90%
and nervous system really are.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
They found that
our neural wiring

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.090 align:middle line:84%
is malleable throughout
our lifetime.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.930 align:middle line:10%
This is what
neuroplasticity means.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Even though the deeper
core wiring of the brain

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
may be set by the age
of 25, the good news

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.910 align:middle line:84%
is that we can still
redirect and rewire it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.820 align:middle line:84%
through our choices, our
attitudes, and our actions.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
When we read most
books or articles

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.220 align:middle line:84%
that discuss rewiring
our brain, they typically

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.650 align:middle line:90%
emphasize a few key things.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Number one, focused
attention, such as when

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:84%
we take on a
challenging new task,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
like learning a new language
or a musical instrument.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is
repetition and practice,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:84%
making it into a
daily habit that we

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:90%
integrate as part of our life.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Research has shown
that it's only

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
after about 90 to 144
straight days of practice

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
that a new behavior becomes
more firmly wired in.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Until then, it takes motivation,
willpower, discipline,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
and self-control
to follow through

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
on achieving that new
skill or behavior.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we need is
the right environment,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
one that is conducive
to learning and change.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:84%
The right environment
includes things

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
like having supportive and
harmonious relationships,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
good physical health,
and the ability to relax.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
If we're too stressed, our brain
kicks into its fight or flight

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
survival mode, and it defaults
to old neural patterns.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore now how we can
take this deeper so that we

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:90%
can truly attain self mastery.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Our intention with this is
to expand our consciousness,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
access those
transcendent states,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
and harness our
greater capacity.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We start with the
part of our brain

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.110 align:middle line:84%
that we have the most
conscious control of--

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:90%
namely, the prefrontal cortex.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
This part of the brain
that scientists call

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:90%
"our executive control center."

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.980 align:middle line:84%
This area is highly connected
to the other brain regions.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Thus, it can govern them
through top down processing.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It oversees our decision making,
control over our impulses,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us the ability
to act with intention.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:84%
The prefrontals sit right behind
the forehead and a little bit

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.580 align:middle line:84%
up from there, coinciding with
the front part of the crown

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:90%
and forehead head area.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.280 align:middle line:84%
How we can use this
knowledge of its location

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
is by tapping on this area to
stimulate it in a rhythmic way.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:10%
For example, tapping the third
eye or just above the eyebrows

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:10%
or even up in the hairline
can stimulate our prefrontals.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:84%
So when and how does our
prefrontal cortex develop?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that this
is actually the last part

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:90%
of the brain to develop.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
That's because it's the most
recent addition to the brain's

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:90%
evolution on Earth.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Now it happens in two
stages of human growth.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:middle line:84%
The first stage occurs
from birth to age 15.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
This primary stage of
prefrontal development

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.890 align:middle line:84%
happens in parallel with the
rest of the brain structures.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:10%
Now because of this, it
becomes highly connected to all

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:10%
the other brain regions.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:84%
The extent of this
connectivity and functionality

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
depends on our experiences,
our environment,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and our social interactions
during our developmental years.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:10%
The early wiring
in our prefrontals

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:10%
is crucial to us, becoming
balanced, well-adjusted adults.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the second
phase of development

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.870 align:middle line:90%
continues from age 15 to 25.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage,
the early connections

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
have become more
deeply rooted, but now

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal themselves
continue to grow and develop

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:90%
more abstract capabilities.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
It's only in our teen
and early adult years

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that we become able
to reason with more

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:90%
complexity and forethought.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.660 align:middle line:84%
This is why proper education
is so important at this time.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Now what else are our
prefrontals in charge of?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.320 align:middle line:84%
In short, they orchestrate
the rest of the brain,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
connecting into all the
other regions and layers.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Connecting into the
cerebral cortex,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:84%
then down into
the limbic system,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and down even into
the old brain.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And while the driving
force of our will

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.570 align:middle line:84%
comes through the mind with
our goals, our intentions,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.530 align:middle line:84%
and choices, it is
our prefrontal cortex

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that orchestrates the
brain-body system.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.380 align:middle line:84%
So what's the key to
specifically rewiring

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:90%
the prefrontals?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with what is known
as hemispheric transfer, which

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
relates to the fact that we have
two hemispheres in the brain--

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:90%
the right and the left lobes.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.770 align:middle line:84%
While they look
similar, evolution

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:19.960 align:middle line:84%
has developed them into two
distinct processing styles.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
These two hemispheres
have sometimes

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:84%
been described as
a team of rivals,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.930 align:middle line:84%
processing the world through
dual streams of attention.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
They perceive in
very different ways.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.330 align:middle line:84%
In our left hemisphere tends
to be more linear, logical,

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:90%
structured, and detail-oriented.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Our right hemispheres more big
picture, gestalt, creative,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.020 align:middle line:90%
and artistic.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the side of
us that connects

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.970 align:middle line:84%
more to nature and
relationships and having fun.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And while we may think
of these two hemispheres

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
as polar opposites,
the truth is that they

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:84%
are meant to work together
for a whole brain experience.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Both the right and
left modes of operation

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.690 align:middle line:84%
are necessary for becoming
a balanced and well-adjusted

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:90%
person.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.680 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
most people tend

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to have imbalances between
these two hemispheres,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:84%
with one dominating
over the other.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And in Western society, we
tend to put much more emphasis

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.490 align:middle line:84%
on the left brain
way of doing things.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:84%
As a result, our modern world
has become very left brain

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:90%
dominant.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Values like reason,
logic, science, IQ,

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.660 align:middle line:84%
being organized and disciplined
and thinking rationally

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:84%
tend to be more emphasized
in society today.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
These have been placed
above the more right brain

00:09:55.070 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
qualities of EQ, nurturing,
artistic expression, empathy,

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.350 align:middle line:90%
intuition.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And because of this,
we live in a world

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that currently places less
value or emphasis on whole brain

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.110 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, this is
starting to change again,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
but it's taking
time for the shift

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:84%
to really reach our
societal institutions,

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:90%
like our education system.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Our education system has been on
a trend of cutting out the art

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and music programs, while
emphasizing math, science,

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.990 align:middle line:90%
and standardized testing.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
This leads to an unbalanced
programming and wiring

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.600 align:middle line:84%
of our brains from the moment
that we enter grade school.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The ideal is not to be right
or left brain dominant,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.830 align:middle line:90%
but to be whole brain.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Between the two
hemispheres is a wide band

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
of nerve fibers known
as the corpus callosum.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.080 align:middle line:84%
What we want is to have
good connectivity here.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And there are methods
we can use to develop

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:84%
a more balanced and
connected whole brain.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.960 align:middle line:10%
In Kabbalah, this is
equivalent to balancing

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:10%
the two pillars of mercy and
severity on the tree of life.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that we
have to work on ourselves

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:90%
to achieve that balance.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
happen if we just

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:84%
keep doing things how
we've always done them.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:84%
In our present state,
we experience life

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
through a set of
filters, and we tend

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
to default to relying
on our strengths,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
while avoiding our
weaknesses But this only

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.100 align:middle line:90%
reinforces the imbalance.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.440 align:middle line:84%
If we want to bring
balance, we have

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.970 align:middle line:84%
to choose to stimulate
the brain in new ways.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.550 align:middle line:84%
We can create new
neural connections

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.630 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen the areas
we're not as strong in.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:10%
Working on our weaknesses
to bring them up

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:10%
to the same level
as our strengths.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
This balances and
builds the bridges

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.320 align:middle line:90%
between the two hemispheres.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Our prefrontals are what give
us humans the ability to engage

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:90%
with the world.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
And because of it, we have
become a powerful species.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:84%
It is what gives us the
ability to act upon our ideals,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:84%
rather than just our
animal instincts.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
One author and psychologist,
Iain McGilchrist,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.390 align:middle line:84%
explores this relationship
between the two hemispheres

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.470 align:middle line:84%
extensively in his book, "The
Master and His Emissary."

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
McGilchrist sums up the
prefrontal and their defining

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:90%
role in the human experience.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:84%
He said, it made us the most
powerful and destructive

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:90%
animals.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:10%
It has also turned us
into the social animal

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:10%
and into an animal with
a spiritual dimension.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason that the
prefrontals are the gateway

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
is because by intentionally
stimulating this area,

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:84%
it automatically sends signals
to the rest of the brain

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.960 align:middle line:90%
and nervous system.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:84%
This aids us in developing
stronger neural connections

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:90%
throughout the brain.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And in addition, by using
methods such as meditation

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
to expand consciousness,
we can also

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:90%
access transcendent states.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.990 align:middle line:90%
So how does this work?

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, the general motto is, what
fires together wires together.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
This is how our neural
pathways are built.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.480 align:middle line:84%
When a stimulus comes
in, it triggers a feeling

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:84%
in the body, which then
triggers a response that

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
is based either on our ego's
desires or our body's needs.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:84%
This ultimately then leads
to a thought pattern.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.030 align:middle line:84%
All of this is firing
off neurons in the brain.

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And the more certain triggers
and patterns fire together,

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.350 align:middle line:84%
the more the neural pathway
is built or reinforced.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
When repeated enough,
this creates strong wiring

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:90%
along that pathway.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And through
repetition, information

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:15.065 align:middle line:84%
is exchanged across
the synaptic gaps.

00:14:15.065 --> 00:14:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And the more the synapses
exchange information,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:84%
the more they then rearrange
to move closer together.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.210 align:middle line:84%
This allows for greater ease
of information exchange,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and this is true for
both our positive wiring

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:90%
and our negative wiring.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:34.610 align:middle line:84%
Meaning our good habits
and our bad habits.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The more we access a
certain pattern or emotion,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.380 align:middle line:84%
the stronger that connection
becomes, making it easier

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.560 align:middle line:90%
to continue accessing.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.490 align:middle line:84%
So what can we do when we
have a negative pattern?

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:54.350 align:middle line:84%
If our brain has wiring towards
negativity or unhealthy default

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:84%
patterns, we can rewire
it to more positive ones.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
First, we must identify
what we want to replace

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:90%
the negative tendency with.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Have a strategy in place for the
new pattern or thought process

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.160 align:middle line:90%
that we want to reinforce.

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:10%
For example, if we tend to
be pessimistic or judgmental

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:10%
about ourselves or
the world, we can

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:10%
choose to replace it with
an attitude of gratitude

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:10%
and acceptance.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Then, start listing the things
that we are grateful for.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is that we
must catch ourselves in the act.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
When we find ourselves
in an old pattern,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.470 align:middle line:84%
we have to interrupt
it and redirect

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
to the more positive wiring
that we wish to implement.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.620 align:middle line:84%
When a pattern is
repeatedly interrupted,

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
the synapses stop
firing together.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And in time, they
disconnect the old pathway.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.430 align:middle line:84%
So first, be prepared for what
you are going to do, and then

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
do it any time
you catch yourself

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.830 align:middle line:84%
in that old negative
pattern or thought.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
This is how we
replace the old habits

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.040 align:middle line:90%
with new, more supportive ones.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We want to be
intentional about it.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:90%
It will take some effort.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Rewiring and instilling
new behaviors and skills

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:84%
takes practice,
focus, and energy.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.610 align:middle line:84%
We must repeat and repeat
over and over again,

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:84%
interrupting that
old pattern and then

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.080 align:middle line:90%
replacing it with a new one.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
Through that dedication,
consistency, and willpower,

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:90%
we make the shift.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
At some point, once it's
been reinforced sufficiently,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
it then becomes an
integrated pattern or habit.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We are, after all,
creatures of habit.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:90%
It's part of our nature.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's just be conscious and
intentional about those habits.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Rather than operating through
our programming or default

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:05.410 align:middle line:84%
coping strategies to determine
how we react to life,

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
we can become proactive
to build habits

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.589 align:middle line:84%
that support us in achieving
our full potential.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
This strategy is where we
start the process of mastering

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.849 align:middle line:90%
our own body's wiring.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.930 align:middle line:84%
As we rewire, we
enhance our ability

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:27.670 align:middle line:84%
to access our full potential
and build a stronger foundation

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:29.670 align:middle line:90%
to live from.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.280 align:middle line:84%
It takes effort to live
consciously and intentionally.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
it gels, becoming

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:90%
an automatic way of life.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Much of this happens
through having

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:47.100 align:middle line:84%
a daily spiritual practice,
whether that practice

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:53.100 align:middle line:84%
is meditation, yoga,
qigong, prayer, or rituals.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.580 align:middle line:84%
In the mystery
school traditions,

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:84%
we make a pattern of
living that includes

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.110 align:middle line:84%
daily rituals to establish a
flow of energy through our day.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
This includes meditation
to quiet the neural firings

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and bring in a higher level
of spiritual awareness.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And when the mind is
quiet, we can then

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:84%
begin to fire new neural
circuits that relate

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.610 align:middle line:90%
to higher spiritual impulses.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember, our brain is a
receiver, processing input

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:90%
from vibrational energies.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.330 align:middle line:84%
By understanding
how this operates,

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.170 align:middle line:84%
we can intentionally use
the right vibrational inputs

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
to stimulate our brain
in a harmonious way.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.670 align:middle line:84%
One way to do this is by working
with brainwave entrainment

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:90%
methods.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.770 align:middle line:84%
To understand how
these tools work,

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:49.230 align:middle line:84%
let's first explore what
brainwaves really are.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:84%
The neural networks
of the brain oscillate

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:90%
as they fire together.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Brainwaves are synchronized
neural oscillations.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
They're not just about
a single neuron firing

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
across the synapse, but
groupings of neurons

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.260 align:middle line:90%
firing together in a network.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And this creates
a chain reaction

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.420 align:middle line:84%
of firings between all
of the neural pathways

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:90%
that are connected.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
The result is a
wave pattern that

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
flows through the connected
sections of the brain.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And these neural oscillations
can range between frequencies

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:90%
of 0, up to 100 Hertz.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:10%
The deepest brainwave
state is called

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:35.100 align:middle line:10%
delta, which vibrates
between 0.1 to 3 Hertz.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.840 align:middle line:84%
And this state
usually corresponds

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.400 align:middle line:84%
to really deep, slow
wave sleep, one in which

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.560 align:middle line:90%
we're not dreaming.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
When in a delta, we're
typically unconscious.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.760 align:middle line:84%
A delta state allows for
the pruning of our neurons

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.300 align:middle line:84%
and synaptic connections that
are not being used anymore.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.850 align:middle line:84%
So a good night's sleep
is essential for the brain

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to have its opportunity
to clean up.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:10%
Next is the theta brainwave
state, just above delta,

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.170 align:middle line:10%
which isolates between 3 to
8 Hertz or beats per second.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:10%
Theta is a deep
meditative state,

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.990 align:middle line:10%
and it rests at
the border between

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:10%
conscious and unconscious.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:26.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the brainwave level that
we want to access and sustain

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:90%
while in meditation.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Typically, without a
strong meditation practice

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:84%
though, we only experience theta
during that brief transition

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.630 align:middle line:90%
between waking and sleeping.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And while in theta, we
may experience colors,

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.910 align:middle line:84%
shapes, images flashing
through our mind's eye.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a dreamy state, where the
ego mind is out of the way,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and yet, we still maintain
some level of awareness.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
What about using activities
like yoga, tai chi, or qigong.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:10%
Typically, these
more active methods

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:10%
are good tools for getting into
an alpha state, but not a theta

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:10%
state.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:10%
Alpha brainwaves, which
oscillate between 8 to 13

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:10%
Hertz, they're good too.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.940 align:middle line:10%
They help to relieve stress
and bring relaxation.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:10%
Things like light
meditation, guided imageries,

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:26.090 align:middle line:10%
a relaxing shower,
and daydreaming

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:10%
all tend to put us
into an alpha state.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Here, we can be tuned into
guidance and spiritual

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:84%
awareness, while still
having our mind engaged

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:38.720 align:middle line:84%
and being aware of
the outer world.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But that also means that the
ego can still engage as well.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
Only in the deeper
theta and delta

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.090 align:middle line:84%
states is the ego
out of the way.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.980 align:middle line:84%
The deeper we go,
the more we feel

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.300 align:middle line:84%
connected to the universal
mind, and our sense of self

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:01.240 align:middle line:84%
dissolves, and we become
one with all that is.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:84%
How about the higher
brainwave states?

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Between 13 to 32 Hertz
is what we call beta.

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:10%
This is actually our
typical waking state,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:10%
where we're engaged
with the outside world.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Beta is when we're more
alert and actively focusing

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
on the things that
are external to us.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
The good thing about
beta is that when

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
we want to learn new information
from an outside source,

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to be in a
harmonized beta state.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, in
our world today, we

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
tend to operate in an
unbalanced beta state,

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.690 align:middle line:84%
with too many chaotic
inputs stimulating us

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to
harmonize the hemispheres

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and access a whole
brain beta state,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:84%
that is when new information can
come in and really take root.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And this allows us to retain
the information better.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.760 align:middle line:10%
Now finally, there's also
higher range, the gamma range,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:10%
between 32 to 100 Hertz.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:10%
These are the highest
brainwave levels

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:10%
that neuroscientists
have been able to detect

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.780 align:middle line:10%
within our brains.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.400 align:middle line:84%
The main peak of the gamma waves
tends to be around 40 Hertz.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating about
this 40 Hertz range

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
is that it has been associated
with peak creativity

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and performance, as well
as visual processing

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and what we call the unity
of conscious perception.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.680 align:middle line:84%
We reach these peak states
in times of elation,

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.310 align:middle line:84%
mystical transcendence, and
when we're really in the zone.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.070 align:middle line:84%
How do we intentionally
stimulate our brain

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:84%
to create these
harmonized states

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.670 align:middle line:84%
without having 20 years of
deep meditation practice?

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:55.230 align:middle line:84%
The keys to doing so rests in
the principles of vibration,

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:90%
resonance, and entrainment.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:84%
At the neuronal
level, brainwaves

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.250 align:middle line:84%
are a form of
rhythmic oscillation.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But such oscillations
require a stimulus.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Without the stimulus,
the oscillations

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:14.610 align:middle line:84%
will dampen and lose
their coherence.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:20.910 align:middle line:84%
That is, unless we introduce a
rhythmic push to keep it going.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Think of like when we
push a child on a swing.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The push gives it more energy to
overcome any dampening effects.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.790 align:middle line:84%
It keeps the swing
going, so long

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.250 align:middle line:84%
as we keep pushing
in the right rhythm.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
This is an example
of a resonant system.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:45.570 align:middle line:84%
We can use the same principle to
intentionally bring in stimuli

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:51.550 align:middle line:84%
to help us entrain and sustain
the desired brainwave patterns.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:56.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the basis of
all neurotechnologies.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:01.500 align:middle line:84%
They use various harmonic
energy sources as stimulation.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Developers are experimenting
with all manner of ways

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.350 align:middle line:90%
to biohack our brains right now.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Such devices might
include techniques

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:14.190 align:middle line:84%
like pulsed LED lights
or tapping on the nerves

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:19.620 align:middle line:84%
and meridians or using sound
and music and binaural beats,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.200 align:middle line:90%
as well as biofeedback.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:84%
By introducing these stimuli
to activate our five senses,

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:84%
we can entrain our brain
into the desired states.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But, we must be
sure to stimulate

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.360 align:middle line:84%
in a harmonious and synchronized
way, not a chaotic or overly

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.310 align:middle line:90%
forceful way.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.710 align:middle line:84%
We can use such
oscillatory energies

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.490 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild the proper
connectivity in our brain

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.610 align:middle line:90%
for more optimal functioning.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.900 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
the corpus callosum.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.170 align:middle line:84%
What are the best methods for
creating greater connectivity

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and balance here at
this part of the brain?

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.660 align:middle line:84%
One simple exercise is
combining music and movement

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.510 align:middle line:84%
that equally engages the
left and right sides.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It can be as simple as
putting on some good music

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.810 align:middle line:84%
while going for a
brisk walk or run,

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.800 align:middle line:84%
but be sure to have nothing in
your hands and swing your arms

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.660 align:middle line:90%
as you walk or run.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.450 align:middle line:84%
This cross lateral
movement automatically

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
harmonizes the left
and right hemispheres.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Music also naturally engages
both hemispheres of the brain.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
But the type of music we choose
to listen to is important.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to equally
harmonizing the brain,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.920 align:middle line:84%
selecting music without
lyrics or chants is important.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And the reason for that is
that lyrics put extra emphasis

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.800 align:middle line:84%
into language centers of
the brain and the left side.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And in regular
situations, that's fine.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
achieving whole brain states,

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:05.290 align:middle line:84%
it's best to use music
without language in it.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Another exercise that
we can do to balance

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.570 align:middle line:84%
the hemispheres of the brain
is more of a visual process.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:84%
This one is an open
eye meditation,

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.770 align:middle line:84%
focusing on a mandala with
balanced and symmetric

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:90%
geometries.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:84%
When meditating on a mandala,
focus on the center point

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.050 align:middle line:90%
or the balance points.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
After connecting to it strongly
with the eyes open, eventually,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:38.670 align:middle line:84%
we then take it inward
and reconstruct it inside.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
All of these
exercises will really

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.760 align:middle line:84%
support this rewiring,
especially the prefrontals

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and the corpus callosum, for a
more balanced and whole brain

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.260 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
As we build a stronger
connection between the mind

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and the brain, and as we
balance the two hemispheres

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.020 align:middle line:84%
for optimal functioning,
we gain more authority

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:90%
over our brain and body system.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And with this, we then
have greater ability

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to master ourselves and
this vehicle of the body.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:84%
Mastering our
thoughts and emotions

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:19.310 align:middle line:84%
is also essential
if we want to step

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:84%
into our next phase
of human evolution

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
and become more fully
realized beings.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we
discover how to unlock even

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.020 align:middle line:90%
more of our brain's potential.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries
