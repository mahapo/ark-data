>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:10%
In spiritual lingo,
we often hear

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.410 align:middle line:10%
people talking about the light.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:10%
Be one with the light and flow
with the light, and so forth.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.560 align:middle line:10%
What does this mean?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
We also hear people
say everything is light

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:90%
like everything is energy.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:90%
What is the light?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with these concepts
of spirit, and love, and light,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and all of that, but
I pushed a lot of it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
away when I got into
my academic studies.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
In physics when we
talk about light,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.420 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about a
very specific thing.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.890 align:middle line:84%
In science, light is defined
as the visible light spectrum.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the colors
like red, orange, yellow,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.080 align:middle line:90%
green, blue, and so forth.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And then we talk about the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:84%
which is a broader
spectrum that includes

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:84%
ultraviolet light, gamma
rays, radio waves, and so on.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
And once I experience
my spiritual reawakening

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and started to seek out a
sense of spiritual community,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
I was attending expos and
science and consciousness

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:90%
events.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And at these events, I'd hear
people talk about the light.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:90%
And I wondered what do you mean?

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Do you mean visible light?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
I'd be guided through a
meditation, for example,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and they'd say,
imagine the light

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
coming down through
the top of your head

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.438 align:middle line:90%
and filling your body.

00:01:41.438 --> 00:01:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And the question that
would come to my mind

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:90%
was what color of light?

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it gold light, or
white light, or purple?

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I wondered whether
metaphysics defined

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.210 align:middle line:84%
the light more like
a scientist would

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than this vague
notion of spirit or energy.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Can we understand the
light, how to use it,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:90%
and how it relates to us?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I was
pleased to finally find

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.285 align:middle line:84%
a more rigorous
philosophy about the light

00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:12.535 align:middle line:84%
when I found my way into the
Mystery School teachings.

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, let's dive
into what the light really is,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.530 align:middle line:84%
including how it
flows from the source,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.530 align:middle line:84%
manifest down through
the plains of vibration

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:84%
into this physical
experience, and let's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.971 align:middle line:84%
also explore our
relationship to the light.

00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:32.545 align:middle line:84%
But to begin with,
let's start by exploring

00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:36.148 align:middle line:90%
where does the light come from.

00:02:36.148 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:84%
In season one of
"Mystery Teachings,"

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.900 align:middle line:84%
we explored quite a bit about
the quantum sea of potential

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.100 align:middle line:90%
and the zero-point field.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.640 align:middle line:84%
We also correlated this with
the Kabbalistic teachings

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and the concept of this
limitless source or the Ain

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.875 align:middle line:90%
Soph.

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Now in many ancient
traditions, whether it's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, or Taoism,
or alchemy, we

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
have this notion of an
infinite source where

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.140 align:middle line:90%
all potentiality is there.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Everything that could come into
being is contained within it,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:90%
but there are no distinctions.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.010 align:middle line:84%
There's not even a
notion of differences.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
It's all combined together
into one infinite source

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
of potential, yet
nothing manifest.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.190 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, we call that Ain
Soph, meaning the limitless

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:90%
or without end.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a name for the
infinite source.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
We can't really
define it beyond that.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.525 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond description.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Everything we
could say about it,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:84%
we could say the
opposite as well.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But everything begins
with this source,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.190 align:middle line:84%
which is at the infinitely
highest end of the spectrum.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
There really is no end,
but you get the idea.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the highest possible
frequency levels,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and it's even beyond
this universe.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.665 align:middle line:84%
So it's hard to describe it with
words because words limit it.

00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
So we start there,
somewhere beyond.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And from this infinite
source, the light

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:90%
begins to emerge out of it.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Many metaphysical teachings
say that from the source,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.650 align:middle line:84%
the essence of light flows from
nothing to become something.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And Kabbalah is
even more specific.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
It talks about something
called the Three

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Veils of Negative Existence.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:10%
These three veils are
called the Ain, which

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:10%
means nothing, the
Ain Soph, which

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:10%
can be translated as maybe
the limitless nothing,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:10%
and the Ain Soph Aur,
which is usually translated

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:10%
as the limitless light.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And they exist above and
beyond or surrounding the tree

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:84%
of life, meaning they precede
the highest spiritual realms.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And as the rays of
creation from source

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:84%
pass through these three veils,
they go from limitless light,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:84%
to limitless
nothing, to nothing.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And then as they emerge
from the nothing,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:84%
they become something which then
forms into the tree of life.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.504 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:07.504 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Now what starts all
of this process?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.396 align:middle line:84%
Why is the light
emerging from source?

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, a key teaching
here is that the light

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:90%
has a specific purpose.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
This is at the core of
understanding the light.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
The light is purpose driven, the
will of Ain Soph or the source

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
sends that light
forward with a purpose.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:84%
There's an intent mixed
with a desire for something

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.566 align:middle line:90%
to be accomplished.

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:44.276 align:middle line:90%
Now what might that purpose be?

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the
metaphysical teachings,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
we hear the purpose
is to express itself,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:84%
to expand its reach in
order to realize more

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:84%
of the full
potentials, to express

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
the full spectrum of becoming
actualized rather than just

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.940 align:middle line:90%
remaining as potential.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately,
what it's looking

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:84%
for is self-actualization
which means

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.120 align:middle line:84%
progression from potential
to full realization.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of what
follows is the result

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:90%
of the divine purpose or intent.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Now in metaphysics,
there is a teaching

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that says purpose defines form.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And as the light goes
out with a purpose,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:84%
in order to fulfill
that purpose,

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.920 align:middle line:90%
we need the proper form.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.190 align:middle line:84%
We need a plan or some
structure or order

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:84%
that's going to allow for
the purpose to be fulfilled.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.680 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Without structure or
order, what do we have?

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have chaos,
and chaos is not

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.490 align:middle line:84%
the most efficient
or effective way

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to move things
forward and progress.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.570 align:middle line:84%
In order to progress
faster, we need order.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Now order allows for a synergy
of many different parts working

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
together, where each part
serves a unique function.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And this way we have less
duplication and the ability

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:90%
to diversify it more.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
So as the light
flows out to fulfill

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
the purpose of self-realization,
expansion, and progression,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.410 align:middle line:90%
it needs to organize itself.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:84%
So it creates a structure,
an ordered system of light.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.646 align:middle line:90%
But how does it do that?

00:07:29.646 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the highest
spiritual levels

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.900 align:middle line:84%
as the light begins
to organize, it

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:84%
takes on unique expressions
of the one mind,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
or in Kabbalah, we call
them intelligences.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.520 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:84%
At each intersection
of light, there

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.130 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritual consciousness
or intelligence

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:90%
with a unique purpose.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
We can think of these
as rays of light each

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.920 align:middle line:84%
with the unique
frequency and vibration.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:84%
The rays, like ripples
on a quiet pond,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:84%
become the way that
the light structures,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:09.430 align:middle line:84%
divides, and recombine to
form many unique combinations.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:13.715 align:middle line:84%
But these rays are intelligences
or conscious beings

00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:14.515 align:middle line:90%
in their own right.

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Now what are we
talking about here?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:10%
Well, different spiritual
traditions around the world

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.920 align:middle line:10%
have deities of some kind.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're archangels,
angels, gods and goddesses,

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.340 align:middle line:90%
and various other spirit beings.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.320 align:middle line:84%
They may be given
different names.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
at their essence,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
they all have the same
archetypal signatures.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of the
names we give them,

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.979 align:middle line:84%
they're all part
of this structure.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:48.370 align:middle line:84%
So here we have all the myriad
of spiritual beings populating

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:84%
the realms of the
spirit, and yet

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.100 align:middle line:84%
they organize themselves
according to certain orders

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.223 align:middle line:90%
and number sequences.

00:08:56.223 --> 00:08:57.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalistic
tradition, they

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.650 align:middle line:84%
talk about the rays
dividing from one,

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:84%
to two, to three, then seven,
12, 22, 32, 64, and onwards,

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:90%
and onwards to 144,000 rays.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
neurological sequences

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.868 align:middle line:84%
that this ordering
can take place in.

00:09:16.868 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to get
into all the details here.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But for now, let's call
this whole structure

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.310 align:middle line:90%
the hierarchy of light.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
It includes all the
realms of the spirit

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and the centers of consciousness
that operate at these levels.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
These are the highest vibrations
of the spectrum consisting

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.610 align:middle line:84%
of the rays of light that
flow from the source.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
What does the light look like
at each level of the structure?

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, purpose
defines form.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And each ray has
a unique purpose.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And as those rays
diversify, they

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:90%
take on a more specific purpose.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Higher up within the
structure, the purpose

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is more all encompassing
or more general.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
But as the rays divide and we
move down towards manifestation

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.900 align:middle line:84%
in the physical,
the purpose becomes

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.805 align:middle line:90%
more specific and diverse.

00:10:09.805 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.680 align:middle line:90%
All of this comes from the one.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But the one must diversify
itself and become the multitude

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.590 align:middle line:84%
in order to manifest the
fullness of its potential.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.480 align:middle line:84%
So here we can see how
monotheistic, pantheistic, and

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
panpsychic spiritual traditions
can all be reconciled.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.020 align:middle line:84%
We could say that there
are many gods and goddesses

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and that all things
contain the divine within,

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.331 align:middle line:90%
and yet it all comes from one.

00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Now to get a better
idea of this,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.770 align:middle line:84%
I like to use the law
of correspondence.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.292 align:middle line:90%
As below, so above.

00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And what do we have
here below that

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
could be a good correspondence
to the structure

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.760 align:middle line:90%
of the hierarchy above?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to look
at man-made hierarchy.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We all know how flawed
those systems are.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And we see the results of
those flaws in our corporations

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:90%
and governments.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.040 align:middle line:84%
But in nature, we have
systems of hierarchies

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.280 align:middle line:84%
that are naturally
made, and, ultimately,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the ancient metaphysicians
said, man know thyself.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And they also said that man
is the measure of all things.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:84%
When we come to know ourselves,
we come to know the divine.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at
ourselves, what do we see?

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm one whole
body, one whole being.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And within my being, there are
many levels and structures.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:84%
There's order in
how it's organized.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.180 align:middle line:84%
If we look at just
our anatomy, it's

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
a very interconnected system.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.480 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.100 align:middle line:84%
We have major systems like
the circulatory system,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.810 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system, digestive
system, the respiratory system,

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.330 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And these major systems
allow for the functioning

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:90%
of the whole.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And within these
major systems, we

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.910 align:middle line:84%
have the organs
that then run them.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:12.110 align:middle line:84%
We have the heart, the brain,
the intestines, the lungs.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
systems, and they're

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.910 align:middle line:90%
run by these major organs.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And then within any organ, there
are compartments and different

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.700 align:middle line:90%
ways in which it functions.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:90%
It's divided up in certain ways.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And then when you get into
the tissues, and the muscles,

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.740 align:middle line:84%
and go even deeper
into the cells,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:84%
we can see how it
continues to divide.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Different types of cells
have different functions,

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and yet they all
operate together

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:90%
to orchestrate the whole.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.065 align:middle line:84%
Each step deeper into the
system becomes more specialized.

00:12:47.065 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And we can go even deeper to the
proteins, and the amino acids,

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and the DNA and then
all of that going down

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
into the atomic and subatomic
levels of this organized

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.030 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And this coordination
at every level

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:84%
allows for the health
and functioning

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of life of the whole body, and
yet we are one whole being.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is a good way to think
of the hierarchy of light.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
The hierarchy of light is like
the body of divine source.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And the major
systems of this body

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
could be like the officers
or orders of the archangels

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%
or the gods and goddesses.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the major organ is
like a specific archangel

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.880 align:middle line:84%
with a specific area
of responsibility.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
The compartments and
the cells of that organ

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.000 align:middle line:84%
are then like the
angelic hosts that

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:90%
operate under the archangels.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:45.320 align:middle line:84%
We can go deeper until we come
into the core DNA level or even

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the atomic level, the
most basic building

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.776 align:middle line:90%
blocks of the whole system.

00:13:50.776 --> 00:13:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Now how far does the
spiritual hierarchy

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of light, the
system of order go?

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, it reaches
all the way down

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:84%
to this physical density
to us here on Earth.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.810 align:middle line:84%
We're a part of it
too, and every part

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
is needed for the
functioning of the whole.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
No one part is any
better than any other.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a coordinated symphony
of creation and manifestation

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.505 align:middle line:84%
to build the functions
of this universal body.

00:14:19.505 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
So we have this spectrum of
energy flowing from the source,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.050 align:middle line:84%
diversifying, specializing,
and then expressing

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.600 align:middle line:84%
the potential of the divine
into a physical manifestation.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:40.110 align:middle line:84%
The higher we go in the system,
the more functions each part

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
has to oversee, the more all
encompassing its purpose.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.450 align:middle line:84%
But the further down we go,
we get more into the details

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
with more specific purposes
and specialized roles.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
This is the true nature of
hierarchy created by the light.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the way
things are ordered.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Now spiritual beings of every
tradition around the world

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.800 align:middle line:90%
are all a part of this system.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
They're all part of
this universal body.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:84%
They all have a purpose
and are flowing the light

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.200 align:middle line:90%
according to their purpose.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.760 align:middle line:84%
They take that light coming
down from the level above it

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and then distribute it
to the levels below.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Another term that
we can give this

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:90%
is the cosmological structure.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Now as the light moves beyond
the realms of pure spirit,

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
it comes into the
realms where it

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.296 align:middle line:84%
starts to manifest within
the physical densities,

00:15:34.296 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and we participate
in this process.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
As spiritual beings
here in the physical,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.570 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability
to wield this light

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to create and manifest from.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Now from perspective
of metaphysics,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
which is both a scientific
and a spiritual philosophy,

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.160 align:middle line:84%
understanding the light
starts with knowing ourselves,

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
knowing how we stand in relation
to the powers of the universe

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.195 align:middle line:84%
and to the light and everything
that forms this universe.

00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:84%
If we know how we stand in
relationship to the rays

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and understand what
they are, we can then

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
understand how to
harness them more.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
We can use them to unlock more
of the potential within us

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.195 align:middle line:84%
to manifest and create
within this physical density.

00:16:20.195 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:90%


00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.790 align:middle line:84%
Now what is the
ultimate function

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.832 align:middle line:84%
of this hierarchy of light
that I've just described?

00:16:28.832 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, beyond it
being about order,

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:84%
the main function of this
structure is about service.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:84%
The light must be distributed
to the rest of creation.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And the function is to serve
that will of the divine source

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:84%
and to express
itself and progress.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Now as the light
flows from the source,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:84%
it starts at that highest
vibration of the spectrum.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And the hierarchy
of light then helps

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
to slow it down and
direct the light

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:90%
to serve its ultimate purpose.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Where does the light
go next from here?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
As the light is shifting
from the spiritual realms

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:84%
through the councils of
the hierarchy of light

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:84%
and into the realms of
physical manifestation,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:84%
now here is where we can start
to perceive the energy more

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.240 align:middle line:90%
directly.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.170 align:middle line:84%
It's all one big spectrum and
all these different levels

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And in season one, we
talked about vibration,

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:84%
and different density levels,
and how light manifests itself

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:90%
through the plains of vibration.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And throughout each level
of this light spectrum,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.662 align:middle line:84%
remember the light
is purpose driven.

00:17:35.662 --> 00:17:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But first the light comes
into the manifested realm

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.570 align:middle line:84%
in the form that we know of as
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.450 align:middle line:10%
This includes everything from
gamma rays all the way down

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:10%
to microwaves, and radio
waves, and even beyond that.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And this light then creates
all things through energy.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.780 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.826 align:middle line:90%
But what do we mean by energy?

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can talk
about E about equals mc

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:90%
squared or vibrational energy.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's true that
everything is energy.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But here at a
metaphysical level,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
it becomes organized
by the archetypes.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:90%
And what do we mean by that?

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, the archetypes
organize this energy

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.405 align:middle line:90%
and begin to create forms.

00:18:16.405 --> 00:18:17.666 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:17.666 --> 00:18:19.390 align:middle line:84%
And the archetypes
include things

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:84%
like the four elements of
earth, water, air, and fire.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, they're
not yet manifested.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
These are more like
philosophical elements

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.736 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning of form, at
the higher vibrational level.

00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
The archetypes also include
the 12 astrological archetypes

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
and the union archetypes
that influence

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:90%
the mind and the psyche.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the archetypes
of numbers, letters, sounds,

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:90%
and sacred geometries.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.010 align:middle line:84%
So at this level of energy,
it's pure archetypal form

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about here.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Now as the light slows down
further from the archetypes,

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
it's then next expressed
and carried through sound.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Sound, it's still
vibrational energy.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.050 align:middle line:84%
But now it's moving
as pressure waves.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And here it's moving the
materia of whatever medium

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
it's traveling through, whether
it's air, or space, or water,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
or earth.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Sound is vibrational
energy that moves

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:23.948 align:middle line:84%
matter which we can
see through the study

00:19:23.948 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and demonstrations of cymatics.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
As the light flows down
through this level of sound,

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.433 align:middle line:90%
how does it manifest next?

00:19:33.433 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer that,
let's take a closer look

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.530 align:middle line:84%
at the structure of sound
and see where this leads us.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The octave is a scale of seven
notes with the eighth note

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:90%
stepping up to the next octave.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, this isn't the only
way to divide sounds.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:84%
In other traditions, there
are seven notes, for example,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:90%
or 24 notes.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.700 align:middle line:84%
But the seven note octave
is aligned with the notion

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.850 align:middle line:90%
of the sacred number seven.

00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And this number
corresponds with the way

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.080 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritual realms
organize themselves,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.020 align:middle line:84%
while the number 12 is more
related to the physical realms

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.710 align:middle line:84%
So in this seven note octave,
we have do, re, mi, fa, so,

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:90%
la, ti.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is the original
sound spectrum based

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.830 align:middle line:90%
on the seven rays of creation.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
we divide this up

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.237 align:middle line:84%
is by working with
the infinity loop.

00:20:27.237 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:84%
When most people think
of the infinity loop,

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.500 align:middle line:84%
they think of two even
loops with the note

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.570 align:middle line:90%
at the very center.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But this is not the
true infinity loop.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
The two halves of the
true infinity loop

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.295 align:middle line:90%
are actually not equal.

00:20:41.295 --> 00:20:43.275 align:middle line:90%
Now how can I say that?

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, because when we're
talking about the laws, of sound

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
we're also talking about the
laws of music, which means

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.000 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
the laws of harmony.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:84%
And these are the same as
a laws of sacred geometry,

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.700 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's all
about proportion.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So we ask what
proportions of things

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
can we work with so that they
are in harmony with each other?

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.308 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:10%
Goethe described sacred
geometry as frozen music.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:84%
The proportions that make
things beautiful and pleasing

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
to the eye are also what make
things pleasing to the ear.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
In music, we talk
about something

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
called the perfect 5th, which
is a 3 to 2 type of ratio

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:84%
or the fifth note
in a scale of seven.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:35.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the note of so, the
perfect fifth, the so chord,

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.900 align:middle line:84%
is what we'd call
the harmony point.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:84%
So if we draw the infinity
loop around the musical scale,

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the node where the two parts
of the infinity loop cross,

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.205 align:middle line:84%
that balance point
must be at the note

00:21:49.205 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
of so, that perfect fifth.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.310 align:middle line:84%
What we see here is that
it's not a 50-50 split.

00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.460 align:middle line:84%
There are four notes on one
side and two on the other.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And it relates more
to the Fibonacci

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:84%
sequence and the golden ratio
as opposed to a 50-50 ratio.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.605 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:07.605 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
important when

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the flow
and slowing things down

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.485 align:middle line:90%
towards life and creation.

00:22:14.485 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
What happens if we put the
balance point at 50-50?

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's no movement.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.565 align:middle line:84%
We have stagnation
or a stalemate.

00:22:25.565 --> 00:22:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Now what this note so
reveals is that asymmetry

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
with perfect harmony
is the proper balance.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Now we have harmonious
movement and flow.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And a key here is that
this balance point

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:84%
forms what we call the
central core to all things.

Now at this balance
point, the light

what we call a tunnel of light.

center axis of all things.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.590 align:middle line:90%
is the template of information.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.870 align:middle line:84%
It is the holographic
encoding level.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the boundary
surface of the universe

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
that the light gets
projected through

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:84%
to manifest the
universe that we know.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Now that encoding level
might be the outer edges that

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.740 align:middle line:84%
surround the physical
universe we know,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
or it could be within
every point of space

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:90%
known as the zero-point field.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the interference patterns
of waves upon the surface

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.440 align:middle line:90%
of the quantum sea.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And light is projected
from the implicate order

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:84%
or from that source, those
higher spiritual realms,

onto the surface and then into
the explicate order creating

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.428 align:middle line:84%
the hologram or the physical
universe that we experience.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Now after light passes
through this Akashic zone,

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.290 align:middle line:84%
it next moves through
the seven astral planes.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And with each of these
levels, the vibrational energy

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:84%
of the light slows
down even more.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
These seven planes
correspond, again,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.790 align:middle line:84%
to that seven notes on the
octave scale which are governed

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:90%
by the laws of harmony.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Each of these notes comes
into the central core

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and then vibrates out from
it and forms an astral plane.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And in between these planes
are sometimes what we call

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
etheric energy, which
divides the astral planes.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.450 align:middle line:84%
And through our consciousness
and methods of astral travel,

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.520 align:middle line:84%
we can access these
astral planes,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.030 align:middle line:90%
including the Akashic zone.

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And through pure consciousness,
we can perceive these energies.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Now let's dig into
this a little deeper.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.570 align:middle line:84%
This structure of the
seven astral planes

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.105 align:middle line:90%
gives us access to knowledge.

00:26:21.105 --> 00:26:23.735 align:middle line:90%
Now how exactly do we access it?

00:26:23.735 --> 00:26:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the highest level,
the seventh dimension,

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and the Akashic zone above
it, we perceive life's energy

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:90%
by understanding the source.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:84%
All the energy from
source and the divine

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.080 align:middle line:84%
is reflected down into this
realm so that we can know

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.980 align:middle line:90%
and perceive it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Then as we come into
the sixth, the fifth,

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and the fourth astral planes,
we perceive these energies

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:55.550 align:middle line:84%
by being one with the spirit,
our own eternal being.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Here we have access to many
spirit beings and the higher

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.520 align:middle line:90%
wisdom that we're here to learn.

As we come down even
further into the third,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.990 align:middle line:84%
second, and first
astral dimensions,

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.980 align:middle line:84%
these are realms of what we
call the elemental powers.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:84%
And we perceive these
energies by working

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.870 align:middle line:90%
with the elemental powers.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
These are the powers of
elemental beings known

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:84%
as fairies, gnomes, or
other mythological beings,

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:84%
which are archetypal,
but they aren't just

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.310 align:middle line:90%
concepts or imaginary.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.430 align:middle line:84%
In these astral planes,
these beings are real,

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:90%
and they exist here.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And we can tune in
and connect with them

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.965 align:middle line:84%
by raising our vibration
up to these first, second,

00:27:36.965 --> 00:27:37.965 align:middle line:90%
and third astral levels.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Now as you can begin to see
now, there is quite a process

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that the light goes
through to reach us here

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:90%
in this physical density.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a very multi-layered and
multi-dimensional structure.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:90%
And there's still more.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.610 align:middle line:84%
As the light continues to go
down through the central core,

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.030 align:middle line:84%
it comes into what we now
call the etheric powers.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And these etheric
energies divide

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:84%
those astral planes and
correspond with a certain type

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.350 align:middle line:90%
of energy that we call will.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.380 align:middle line:90%
Now remember the light--

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:84%
it was sent out with
an intent, meaning

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.570 align:middle line:90%
a will of divine source.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, here, at this level,
there are three wills.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.460 align:middle line:84%
There's the highest
will of the divine,

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.910 align:middle line:84%
but then we also have the will
of nature in the universe.

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And we have the will of
humans as a collective.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And we can perceive
these energies

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.890 align:middle line:84%
through acceptance
of these wills.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:33.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Now what this means is that
by accepting the divine will

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.120 align:middle line:84%
and becoming one
with that will, we

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.190 align:middle line:84%
can perceive or be in
tune with this energy.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And what might this
look like in our lives?

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, imagine the
clarity we would

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:53.900 align:middle line:84%
have if we lived in alignment
with divine will all the time.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We'd be living a life
of exploring the fullest

potential not just getting

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:04.120 align:middle line:84%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And, next, to perceive the
will of nature in the universe,

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.120 align:middle line:84%
we then need to be in tune
or flowing and in harmony

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.490 align:middle line:90%
with natural law.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:84%
How often are we aware
of the world around us?

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Are we paying attention to
the subtle energies that we're

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:84%
interacting with, the
energies of nature,

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of
the earth, or do we

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.860 align:middle line:84%
tune it out and live a
one dimensional life,

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.640 align:middle line:84%
believing this physicality
is all there is?

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Or do we see the world
as alive and conscious?

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Being in tune with nature
and the greater universe

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:51.390 align:middle line:84%
is what helps us to
perceive these energies.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a matter of tuning
in and bringing our attention

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
And then the third layer
of this etheric energy

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:03.960 align:middle line:84%
is the will of humans, and we
perceive the will of humans

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.070 align:middle line:84%
by recognizing that we are
a part of the collective.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.900 align:middle line:84%
That means that
everything that happens

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.550 align:middle line:84%
within the collective will of
humanity is also within us.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:16.260 align:middle line:90%
It's not just out there.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.966 align:middle line:90%
It's also in here.

00:30:18.966 --> 00:30:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we accept that we are
part of the will of humans,

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:84%
we not only can
perceive the energy

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that is flowing through but
we can also influence it.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.150 align:middle line:84%
We can start to direct it
in a more positive way.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Now as the light
continues to flow down

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.090 align:middle line:84%
through the vibrational levels,
down through that central core,

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:42.375 align:middle line:84%
it eventually comes
into our energy body.

00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Now what does this structure
of our energy body consist of?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a light hits
the physical density

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
at this dimension, it becomes
what we call magnetic energy.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And here we mean the
electromagnetic energy

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that we can feel
with our senses.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And as we become more active
with our magnetic energy,

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:90%
we can also perceive more.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic energy is
something we can feel.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all about polarity.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:14.490 align:middle line:84%
We have the polarity of left

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:16.480 align:middle line:90%
male and female.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's also about the flow of
energy between those poles.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And magnetic energy is also
about movement and balancing,

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.705 align:middle line:84%
trying to find that dynamic
movement between the poles.

People who have strong
magnetic energies and fields,

they're often noticed as
having a magnetic personality.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We're naturally drawn to
them or sometimes we're

repulsed by them.

Now martial artists often have
a very strong magnetic field

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because they actively work
on developing their qi

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and moving that energy
between the left

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.115 align:middle line:90%
and right sides with balance.

Now in addition to
magnetic energy,

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:84%
as the light continues to flow
in through our central core,

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.100 align:middle line:84%
it also then flows out
through the chakras.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And as it flows out
through the chakras,

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.220 align:middle line:84%
it fills this bubble of energy
around us called the aura.

the more we can perceive

physical senses,

And everything that enters into
this sphere, we can perceive.

The more we use this
energy of our aura,

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.540 align:middle line:84%
the more we'll know what's
happening around us as well

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.920 align:middle line:90%
as within us.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And not only does the light
flow through our aura,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.450 align:middle line:84%
but it also flows
through our tree

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:84%
of life, which is contained
within every cell of our body

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.710 align:middle line:90%
as our DNA.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And we can perceive this energy
even more by activating our DNA

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:59.412 align:middle line:84%
and working with
our tree of life.

00:32:59.412 --> 00:33:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this, we
activate more of our potential

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:84%
here in this physical dimension
and this density level.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We're turning on
the light switches,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.740 align:middle line:84%
accessing the light of
the highest source flowing

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.465 align:middle line:90%
into us and into our DNA.

00:33:14.465 --> 00:33:16.010 align:middle line:90%

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Now as the light comes into
us and into the physical forms

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.550 align:middle line:84%
of life around us,
here we finally

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.770 align:middle line:84%
perceive this life
energy through our five

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.650 align:middle line:90%
physical senses.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.730 align:middle line:84%
By embracing these forms of
life through seeing, hearing,

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.880 align:middle line:84%
tasting, touching,
and smelling them,

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:38.890 align:middle line:84%
this is how we fully engage
in this experience of life.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And doing so awakens
more of our consciousness

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.650 align:middle line:84%
here in our physical
life bringing us

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:47.470 align:middle line:84%
to a greater awareness
of the light of spirit

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:50.390 align:middle line:90%
embodied in the physical world.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So embrace those forms of life
with all your five senses.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual light
and consciousness

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.035 align:middle line:90%
exist in everything.

00:33:59.035 --> 00:34:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And the more we embrace
the forms of life

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.620 align:middle line:84%
through a sensory rich
life experiencing all

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that life has to
offer, the more we

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:12.330 align:middle line:84%
become awakened to
spirit in everything.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:16.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is how the light flows
from the highest source down

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.909 align:middle line:84%
through the spiritual
realms, down

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.850 align:middle line:84%
through the electromagnetic
spectrum, the archetypes,

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the field of celestial
sounds, and then

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:84%
down into that tunnel of light
through the astral planes,

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.320 align:middle line:84%
the etheric field, the
magnetic energies into the aura

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.929 align:middle line:84%
and the energy body
that we have, and then,

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.560 align:middle line:84%
finally, into the DNA and
the four elements of earth

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.090 align:middle line:84%
that we experience
through our senses.

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And it flows into those physical
forms that we're surrounded by.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:46.530 align:middle line:84%
And by embracing these
forms with our senses ,

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.139 align:middle line:90%
we awaken more fully.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:51.389 align:middle line:84%
It's all about
vibrational energy

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and perceiving that
vibrational energy.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And there are many ways
that the light manifests,

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.480 align:middle line:84%
and we can perceive
it in many ways.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.880 align:middle line:84%
But the important thing here
is that it's all one spectrum.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily a
continuum, but it is all one.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And from the highest spiritual
energy to the most dense,

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.950 align:middle line:90%
it's all light from source.

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet there are a multitude
of ways that we can experience

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:90%
the expression of the oneness.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.980 align:middle line:90%

Now in the Mystery
School, we train people

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.190 align:middle line:84%
how to perceive all of
these levels of energy

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.850 align:middle line:90%
that we've talked about here.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of time, and
it starts from the bottom up.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.130 align:middle line:84%
It starts with embracing
all the forms of life

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:42.070 align:middle line:84%
and activating the DNA and then
into the magnetic, the etheric,

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:46.400 align:middle line:84%
the astral dimensions,
onwards and upwards.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.350 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalistic
tradition, we also

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.190 align:middle line:84%
talk about the ways in which the
light manifest as it flows down

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:84%
from the source into
the tree of life

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and then into the
physical world.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:84%
As a Kabbalist working with
this blueprint for creation,

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:84%
we become the masters
of manifestation

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and create like
the source creates.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We have this ability, and
this is what we're here to do.

the blueprint of manifestation

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and the magic formula for
mastering this process.
