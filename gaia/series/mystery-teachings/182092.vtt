>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:10%
What if there is
a way to harness

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:10%
the physics of time, energy,
space, and momentum by will

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:10%
alone?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:10%
Imagine how much more
we could accomplish.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.820 align:middle line:10%
We could become
like super humans.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.290 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that these
phenomenon are adjustable.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
We can master them, rather
than be bound by them.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we explore how
to intentionally use principles

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
from both science and
metaphysics in practical ways

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.275 align:middle line:84%
to expand beyond
perceived limitations.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:90%
Life today moves fast.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Old modes of operating
are no longer sufficient.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.080 align:middle line:84%
By consciously
harnessing the loss

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:84%
of nature and the universe,
we can stretch time,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:84%
enhance vitality and
energy, amp up our momentum,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:90%
and use space better.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
All these phenomenon
are interrelated,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
and our perception of them
is relative, and therefore,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:90%
changeable.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Shifting the flow
of these things

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.550 align:middle line:90%
comes down to one thing--

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:90%
vibration.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything we experience
is based on vibration.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Everything is energy, vibrating
at a certain frequency.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:84%
As Nikola Tesla
said, "If you want

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.880 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
secrets of the universe,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
think in terms of energy,
frequency, and vibration."

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:90%
What is vibration?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:84%
In physics, vibration refers
to rhythmic oscillation

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:84%
of particles or
wavelike energies.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.000 align:middle line:84%
For example, at the atomic and
subatomic levels of nature,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.710 align:middle line:84%
quarks are constantly in
flux, popping in and out

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum vacuum,
like a boiling sea.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the nuclei of atoms
are vibrating very rapidly.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.060 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the electrons that
surround the nuclei cannot be

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.040 align:middle line:90%
found in one place.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they form a
wavelike cloud of energy

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.890 align:middle line:90%
that orbits the nucleus.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%
Electrons are never at rest.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
This constant vibration is
the basis of all matter,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
even if that matter
appears to be stationary

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:90%
from our perspective.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.580 align:middle line:84%
This principle of
vibration was well

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
understood by hermetic
initiates of old.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:90%
They said, nothing rests.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Everything moves,
everything vibrates.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Vibration is about
movement, but again, it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:90%
is a rhythmic movement.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
So the principle of
rhythm also applies here.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
In physics, the
rate of vibration,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.410 align:middle line:84%
meaning how fast or slow
something is oscillating,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.490 align:middle line:90%
is called frequency.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Frequency is a rhythm.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.410 align:middle line:84%
It is measured as beats or
cycles per unit of time.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Rhythm is about the
pendulum swing to the left

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.960 align:middle line:84%
and to the right,
the ebb and the flow,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
in and out, high and
low in equal proportion.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This principle says
that rhythm compensates,

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and it manifests
itself in everything,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and that rhythm moves between
two poles back and forth.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So the principle of
polarity also applies.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Polarity is about how
things that seem opposite

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
are actually two poles
of the same thing.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:84%
They're just vibrating
at different degrees

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:90%
on one spectrum.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.530 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, take for
example, heat and cold.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:84%
These are just varying
degrees of temperature,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.620 align:middle line:84%
which is based on vibration
rates of molecules.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Whether we feel
something as hot or cold

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
depends on where our body
temperature is on that scale.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
Things that are higher
temperature than us

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:84%
will feel hot, while lower
temperatures will feel cold.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The same is true for light and
darkness, noise and silence,

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
positive and negative,
spirit and matter, and so on.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:90%
None of these are absolutes.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:84%
Rather, they are degrees
on the spectra of polarity.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And the important
thing to remember

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.210 align:middle line:84%
is that our perceptions of
various vibrational phenomena

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:84%
are all relative to
our own vibration.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Vibration is what creates
the differences in all

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive and
experience in life.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Everything, from the material
we touch, to the sounds we hear,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.530 align:middle line:84%
the flavors we taste, and
all the myriad energies

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.850 align:middle line:84%
we experience are different,
primarily because they

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:90%
have different vibrations.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
When we realize that everything
in life is about vibration,

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.930 align:middle line:84%
we'll also see how
even our thoughts

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.980 align:middle line:84%
have vibrational energy and
can affect things as much

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.430 align:middle line:90%
as other aspects of life.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:10%
These three principles
of vibration, rhythm,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.320 align:middle line:10%
and polarity, all work
together in a synergistic way.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And the cool thing is that
we can harness and master

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.160 align:middle line:84%
these principles
in our own lives.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:84%
By viewing life as energy,
frequency, and vibration,

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.800 align:middle line:84%
we can come to better
understand the fabric of reality

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:90%
and its underlying structure.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.900 align:middle line:84%
We can also discover how to
shift these things at will.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.050 align:middle line:84%
As we shift our
vibrations and rhythms

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.140 align:middle line:84%
on the spectra of
polarity, we can also

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:84%
alter our experience of energy,
space, time, and momentum.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Recall from other episodes
how these things--

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.720 align:middle line:84%
energy, space,
time, and momentum--

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:84%
are emergent properties
of our universe,

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
rather than fundamental
building blocks.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:84%
They emerge as a result
of the hologram being

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
projected into this dimension
from somewhere beyond.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
What's at the core
of these, what is now

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
thought to be the most
fundamental building

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.400 align:middle line:84%
block of our universe,
is information,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
meaning the encoded information
that generates the hologram.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:10%
But what is information,
and where does it come from?

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:10%
Is it just quantum
bits of binary code,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:10%
like what's depicted in
the movie "The Matrix,"

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:10%
or is it the
interference patterns

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:10%
from some intersecting
waves of light,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:10%
as we see in the encoding of
our hologram playing cards.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Or could it be the
vibrational notes

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
being played on supersymmetric
strings and membranes.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.880 align:middle line:84%
Cabalistic wisdom also
offers some insight.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.880 align:middle line:10%
In the Sepher Yetzirah,
it begins with saying "In

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:10%
thirty-two wonderful
paths of wisdom,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:10%
did Jah engrave his
name by three Seraphim--

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.080 align:middle line:10%
numbers, letters, and sounds."

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Could this engraving
of the name of God

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
be akin to the
encoding of information

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:90%
that creates the hologram?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:84%
If so, the numbers,
letters, and sounds

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.300 align:middle line:84%
are the building blocks used
to encode the information.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
What is meant by numbers,
letters, and sounds?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.410 align:middle line:84%
As a physicist and
a cabalist, I think

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
of these numbers as pure
quantum frequencies,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
or alternatively, as
the rays of creation

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
from source, which we could
also relate to superstrings.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Then the letters are more
like combinations or patterns

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.910 align:middle line:84%
formed as different
numbers interact.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:84%
These form a more modulated
or rhythmic combination

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies, which become
the interference patterns that

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:90%
inform the holographic encoding.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Finally, sounds are the outward
expression of the letters

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.100 align:middle line:90%
or vibrational patterns.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.280 align:middle line:90%
Sound is what shapes matter.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.860 align:middle line:84%
In the hologram
analogy, the sounds

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
could be the vibrational
energy from source

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
that shines through the
holographic encoding

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:90%
to project into the universe.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.071 align:middle line:84%
This brings us, again, back
to the principle of vibration.

00:08:56.071 --> 00:09:00.670 align:middle line:84%
Only now, we see that this
applies in the quantum realm

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and beyond into the
spiritual realm.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Vibration is not just
a physical phenomenon.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Vibration originates
with the source

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
at the spiritual levels,
when the rays or numbers are

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.710 align:middle line:90%
sent out.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Now how can we apply this?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.300 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it tells us that
numbers are the first building

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.320 align:middle line:90%
block.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Physicists would relate
numbers to mathematics.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysicists, however,
relate numbers to numerology.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words, numbers are
not so much for counting.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:90%
Rather, they have meaning.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
They are bridges or links
to the rays of creation.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:10%
Cabalistically, the
numbers are assigned

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:10%
meaning according
to the tree of life,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:10%
with the number 1 being at
the top of the tree, closest

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:10%
to the source.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.730 align:middle line:10%
And the numbers 9 and
10 are at the bottom,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.500 align:middle line:10%
closest to the physical.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.750 align:middle line:10%
So vibrationally
speaking, number 1

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:10%
is the highest vibration,
while 10 is the lowest.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.740 align:middle line:10%
One way we use
this is to imagine

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:10%
a vertical scale with the
number 1 at the top and 10

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.190 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.560 align:middle line:10%
Think of it like
tuning the dial.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:10%
When we want to raise
vibration, then we

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:10%
move the dial up the scale.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.240 align:middle line:10%
When we want to lower vibration,
we bring it back down,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:10%
and visualize the
numbers as we do this.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:84%
This is one technique we can use
for shifting our energy level.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:90%
Why specifically energy?

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, because energy
is about frequency.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore the phenomenon
of energy a bit more now.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:90%
What is energy?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:84%
In physics, energy
typically refers

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to the capacity to do work.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But at the quantum
level, energy is

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
directly proportional
to the frequency

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:84%
of a particle or a wave,
such as a photon of light.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.890 align:middle line:84%
The higher the frequency,
the higher the energy.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:84%
In the visible light spectrum
frequency relates to color.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, red has a
lower frequency and thus,

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
lower energy than
blue or purple.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Other qualities of light, such
as the intensity or brightness,

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:84%
do not affect the energy
level of a photon,

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.390 align:middle line:84%
meaning that yellow light
emitted from a burning candle

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:29.950 align:middle line:84%
has the same energy as yellow
light emitted from the sun.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:84%
The other important
physics principle

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.820 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to energy is the
law of conservation of energy.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.000 align:middle line:84%
It famously states, energy
cannot be created or destroyed.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.720 align:middle line:90%
It can only be transformed.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Hermes said something
similar over 8,000 years ago.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:10%
He said, "The universe is
the work of eternity, which

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:10%
has never come into
being and is ever coming

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.040 align:middle line:10%
into being through eternity.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:10%
For which reason, it will never
be destroyed because eternity

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.610 align:middle line:10%
is indestructible."

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.940 align:middle line:84%
He also said, death is
a kind of destruction,

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
but nothing in the
universe is ever destroyed.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
So the source does
not create energy.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Energy is already there.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
It is eternal, and there
is an infinite supply

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:90%
from which to draw.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that source
does is activate the energy

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.510 align:middle line:84%
by turning on the lights,
shifting it from potential

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
to actual, from a
quantum possibility

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.250 align:middle line:90%
to manifested reality.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:84%
This is something we can do
too if we raise our vibration

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
and harness our will properly.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Energy, thus, has to do with
frequency or rate of vibration.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:84%
It can be high or low
or somewhere in between.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:10%
Our personal energy is based
upon our vibrational state.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
By shifting or transforming our
energy levels vibrationally,

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
we can directly improve how we
function in our daily lives.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Wouldn't it be nice if we
could control our energy levels

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.730 align:middle line:84%
at will, without having to
rely on things like caffeine

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:90%
or sugar to pick us up?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly more empowering
and gives us the ability

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.850 align:middle line:84%
to sustain our energy without
going through so many ups

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.290 align:middle line:90%
and downs.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We also take in energy
through our senses.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Our senses are basically
detectors and transformers

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.170 align:middle line:84%
of energy from different
frequency ranges.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, light is
electromagnetic energy.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:84%
We know there is
a broad spectrum

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.260 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic
energy, all of which

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:84%
can be absorbed by
ourselves and atoms.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Our eyes are tuned to see the
visible light spectrum, which

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:59.140 align:middle line:84%
is just a small sliver
of the full spectrum.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.920 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea behind
color therapy, as well as

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
the many applications of
LED light therapy today,

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
is all taking in the different
frequencies of visible light

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.210 align:middle line:84%
to have different effects
on our body and psyche.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, our ears are tuned to
hear a certain range of sounds,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.930 align:middle line:84%
which are pressure waves
that vibrate the eardrums.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
These get transformed
into electrical signals

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:90%
to our brain and body.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Humans can hear sounds
over a 10 octave range--

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.680 align:middle line:84%
10 times more than
our visual capacity.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
We hear from as low as 16 Hertz
to as high as 20,000 Hertz.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:84%
But again, there is a much
broader spectrum of sound.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Some other fascinating
tidbits about the ears,

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
as a good gateway for
bringing in energy,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
our ear has three times more
nerve connections to the brain

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.260 align:middle line:90%
than the eye does.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And the auditory nerve
also feeds energy

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:84%
directly into every
organ of the body.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.290 align:middle line:84%
No wonder we feel
so good when we

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.100 align:middle line:90%
listen to our favorite music.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Similar things can be said
about our other senses

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.560 align:middle line:90%
of touch and smell and taste.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.810 align:middle line:84%
Each has a certain
range of frequencies

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.160 align:middle line:84%
we can detect and take in, but
the full spectrum of energies

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:84%
are much broader than
what our senses perceive.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Just remember, we can use our
senses in an intentional way

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to bring in energy and
help us shift vibration.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way for us to
broaden our sensory range?

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:90%
Yes, of course.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.070 align:middle line:84%
It's all a matter of
training the senses

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
to more subtle frequencies
and paying attention

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.020 align:middle line:90%
to those subtleties.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Most extra-sensory
perception is simply

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.310 align:middle line:84%
a matter of becoming more
aware of subtle energies.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Assumption is the
enemy of perception.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Far too often, people assume
what is happening around them,

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and then their brain fills
in gaps with illusions

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.710 align:middle line:90%
that match our assumptions.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
When we want to develop
our intuition and ESP,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
we must train ourselves
to not assume anything.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.560 align:middle line:84%
To really look, really
sense, pay attention

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:90%
to the details and subtleties.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.400 align:middle line:84%
The more we do this, the
more we rewire our brain

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and start using
more of our capacity

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:90%
for conscious awareness.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of tuning in
to subtle energies,

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.680 align:middle line:84%
there is a legend about the
ancient Greek philosopher

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and initiate
Pythagoras that says

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
he could hear the
music of the spheres,

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
meaning an acoustic
energy produced

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
by the movements of celestial
bodies like planets and stars.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras believed that those
of a certain bloodline who

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.109 align:middle line:84%
had been through a
series of initiations

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:84%
would also be able to
open up to the levels

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.609 align:middle line:84%
where they too could hear
the music of the spheres.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:84%
I've heard and felt
this symphony before

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:84%
in certain meditations, and it
is breathtakingly beautiful.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:84%
My own experiences would
attest that through initiation

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
and heightening
our vibration, we

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:84%
can become more attuned to
perceiving and receiving

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
a broader spectrum of
energies in the universe.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's return for
another moment to how

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
we can raise our vibration
of energy at will,

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:84%
without having to use
anything from outside of us.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.950 align:middle line:84%
This also ties into our senses
just in a different way.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
We each have sensory
tunings that differ.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:55.260 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are more visual,
some are really kinesthetic.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Others are strong in
their auditory processing,

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
and still others have a strong
sense of smell or taste.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Whichever is our dominant sense
that we are best tuned into,

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
we can consciously use
this sensory function

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:14.230 align:middle line:84%
on the inner planes
to shift our energy.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.750 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, similar to the
visualization method

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
mentioned earlier
with the number scale,

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
we can use analogous techniques
for each sensory framework.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Visual processors, for
example, can use colors

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.470 align:middle line:90%
to focus and shift energy.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Seeing the dial move towards
purple to raise energy

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
or towards red to lower
energy and ground.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:90%
Auditory people can use pitch.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Tune in to higher
pitch to raise energy

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:84%
or lower it back down
the scale to a bass

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:90%
tone for grounding energy.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Those who are
kinesthetic can feel

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
temperature shift between
high and low on the scale.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Or alternatively, we can
imagine our molecules

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:90%
vibrating fast or slow.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Usually when more
energy is flowing,

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
we will feel hot,
buzzing, or tingly.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.280 align:middle line:10%
And for those who have a
strong sense of smell or taste,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:10%
high vibration can be something
like frankincense or rosemary

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:10%
or a spice like cinnamon.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:10%
While a low earthy vibration
can be something like mugwort

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:10%
or shilajit or patchouli
or root vegetables

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.190 align:middle line:10%
that carry a grounding energy.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:84%
We must first train our
senses to become clear

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.520 align:middle line:84%
in our ability to distinguish
between different vibrations.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.250 align:middle line:84%
Once we get good
at recognizing what

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
is high frequency versus
what is low frequency

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and how they make
us feel, then we

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:84%
can use this awareness to
adjust our dial at will.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
This is how we apply the alchemy
of life to shift our vibration.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Energy responds to
our will, and our will

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:90%
is directed by our intent.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:84%
This is where a consciousness,
mastery of mind,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and hermetic alchemical
training is key.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
The biggest task is in gaining
self mastery of our will

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and mind, becoming the
captain of our ship,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:32.940 align:middle line:84%
rather than letting ego or
subconscious patterns drive us.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:90%
How about space and time?

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:90%
How are these adjustable?

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:84%
It relates to Einstein's
special theory of relativity.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.780 align:middle line:84%
This theory shows
that space and time

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are linked, while the
speed of light in a vacuum

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.860 align:middle line:84%
is assumed as a
universal constant.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The theory assumes
that nothing with mass

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.240 align:middle line:84%
can go faster than
the speed of light.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:84%
But for objects traveling
near the speed of light,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.500 align:middle line:84%
time seems to
dilate, while length

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.090 align:middle line:84%
seems to contract in comparison
to when the object is not

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:90%
moving.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Thus, Einstein's theory
reveals that our experience

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:84%
of time and distance are
relative to our state

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:90%
of motion.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.850 align:middle line:84%
It implies that time and
space can change in order

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate the immutability
of the speed of light.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:10%
One way this is
commonly depicted

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:10%
is with a thought
experiment using two twins.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:10%
One twin is in a spaceship
that is traveling

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:10%
at a constant speed close to the
speed of light for five years,

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:10%
according to their clock.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:44.900 align:middle line:90%
The other twin stays on Earth.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.420 align:middle line:84%
From Earth's
perspective, time seems

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
to run slower for the
space traveling twin

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.930 align:middle line:84%
than it does for
the twin on Earth.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:84%
The twin in space has
only aged five years,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
while the one on Earth
has aged 50 years.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
But from their own
frame of reference,

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.100 align:middle line:84%
each twin perceives time to
be flowing in a normal way.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.460 align:middle line:90%
What can we learn from this?

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.220 align:middle line:90%
How can we use it?

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, our experience
of time and distance

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
are relative to our
state of motion.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So if we can change
our state of motion,

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
then we can shift our
flow of time and space

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:90%
in a relative way.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And by state of
motion, let's not

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.830 align:middle line:84%
think of this in a
linear, classical way now.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's think of it
in a quantum way.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Every atom and particle of our
body is constantly in motion.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Everything moves,
everything vibrates.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.390 align:middle line:84%
This means that by
shifting our vibration,

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:51.760 align:middle line:84%
we can alter our experience
of time and space.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with time.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.500 align:middle line:84%
How can we alter our
experience of it?

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.110 align:middle line:84%
First, we must
establish that this is

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.630 align:middle line:90%
about our relative experience.

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.900 align:middle line:84%
It is related to our
conscious relationship

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.210 align:middle line:90%
with the flow of time.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
For us humans, we measure
time by the clock,

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:84%
which is synchronized
to a 24-hour day,

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
based on the Earth's
rotation around its own axis,

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and then 365 days in
a year as the Earth

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:90%
orbits around the sun.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth's
reference frame is

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.950 align:middle line:84%
rotating at a rate of
one cycle per 24 hours.

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Or, if we convert that into
Hertz, it comes out to about 10

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.280 align:middle line:84%
to the power minus
5 cycles per second.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.210 align:middle line:84%
This is actually very
slow by our standards,

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.690 align:middle line:84%
but Earth has another
vibrational rate

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:52.300 align:middle line:84%
that influences our biorhythms,
and especially our brainwaves.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Known as the Schumann
Resonance, this vibration

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is based on the Earth's
electromagnetic field,

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.470 align:middle line:84%
as it moves around the globe and
oscillates between the Earth's

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.960 align:middle line:90%
surface and ionosphere.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:10%
It ranges between
3 to 60 Hertz, but

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:14.740 align:middle line:10%
its fundamental resonant
peak is at about 7.83 Hertz.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, our
brainwaves tend

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:10%
to range anywhere from
about 0.1 to 100 Hertz,

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.550 align:middle line:10%
but typically are
under 40 Hertz.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:84%
The 8 Hertz level
of the brainwaves,

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.090 align:middle line:84%
which is very close to
the Schumann Resonance,

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:84%
marks a transition point
between waking and sleeping

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:90%
for most people.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:10%
So let's say that this
frequency level of the Schumann

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:10%
Resonance, or about 8 Hertz, is
the benchmark rate of vibration

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:10%
for the Earth reference frame.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we apply
this to ourselves?

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:84%
If we can raise
our vibration rate

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
to higher frequencies
than the Earth's rate,

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.170 align:middle line:84%
then we can experience a
different relative flow

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The faster our
vibration, the more time

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:84%
will expand for us relative
to its usual flow on Earth.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, we can accomplish
more in less time.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.380 align:middle line:84%
How do we raise our vibration
with respect to time?

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Raising vibration, again, is
what alchemy is all about,

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and there are many
methods that work.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
One method that is
particularly easy to use

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.240 align:middle line:84%
is to increase the
speed of our aura.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Earth
rotates on its axis

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and has electromagnetic energy
flowing around the globe,

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.490 align:middle line:84%
our aura is a sphere
of energy and light

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:90%
that rotates around us.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Most people are not
aware of this happening,

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:84%
but it is moving and
fluctuating all the time.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.300 align:middle line:84%
By becoming more
aware and by using

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
meditation and
visualization techniques,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.910 align:middle line:90%
we can adjust the speed.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:07.390 align:middle line:84%
When we want to
stretch or expand time,

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:13.930 align:middle line:84%
we can visualize or feel our
aura rotating faster around us.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
When we want to contract time,
we can slow our aura down.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.260 align:middle line:84%
In this process, it is
important to remember

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:27.550 align:middle line:84%
that we must visualize the
aura rotating clockwise as seen

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:32.680 align:middle line:84%
from above, or as seen from
our perspective looking out

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
so that it is a forward
movement of progression

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
and aligned with
the flow of nature.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Nature has a
preference of rotating

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.870 align:middle line:84%
in a clockwise direction
for it to be life-enhancing.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:50.830 align:middle line:84%
This is better known in science
as the chireality of life.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
At a chemical level, only
right-handed or clockwise

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.030 align:middle line:84%
twisting versions of
DNA and RNA molecules

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.670 align:middle line:90%
are found in life on Earth.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
This also aligns with
mystery school teachings

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
that the flow of
the will of nature

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and the flow of the
will of God flow

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.180 align:middle line:90%
clockwise as seen from above.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.870 align:middle line:84%
If we want to harness
time, then we best

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:84%
do it in alignment with
this clockwise flow

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of nature and divinity.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The other key to
stretching time is

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.160 align:middle line:84%
to get our aura rotating faster
than the Earth's frequency

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:31.330 align:middle line:84%
level, meaning faster than
eight cycles per second.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.030 align:middle line:10%
The faster we spend
our aura, the more

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.580 align:middle line:10%
our sense of time expands.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
If we think about approaching
the speed of light,

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.060 align:middle line:84%
as Einstein imagined, we'd
be talking about a frequency

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:46.150 align:middle line:84%
rate of hundreds of
trillions of Hertz,

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:90%
which is incredibly fast.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And while it's
maybe possible, it

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:84%
would require a lot
of energy, as well as

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:59.320 align:middle line:84%
becoming like the calm eye
at the center of the storm.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, for
practical purposes,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.590 align:middle line:84%
there is no need to
stretch time that much.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:84%
In this method, the key is
in the movement of our aura,

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.512 align:middle line:84%
and our aura is something
that extends through space.

00:28:14.512 --> 00:28:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Time is essentially a measure
of movement through space.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.300 align:middle line:90%
What is space?

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:10%
It's the three
dimensions we live in,

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.020 align:middle line:10%
and we measure distance
or size in terms

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.070 align:middle line:10%
of length, width, and height.

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:36.160 align:middle line:10%
While harnessing space is not
something we often think about,

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:10%
except for maybe when
decorating a new house

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.020 align:middle line:10%
or trying to organize
our workspace,

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:46.990 align:middle line:10%
it is a very important aspect of
mastering our flow and energy.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Space allows us to
express our creative gifts

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.360 align:middle line:90%
into this reality.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:59.110 align:middle line:84%
The spaces we are in can either
feel big or small, spacious

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
or cramped, depending on
how strong and expansive

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:90%
our energetic field is.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Most empaths can
relate to the feeling

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:13.730 align:middle line:84%
of walking into a crowded
room and becoming overwhelmed.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Empaths tend to be sensitive
to the energies of others.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:84%
In a crowded space,
they might feel

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.850 align:middle line:84%
a chaotic mixture of
everyone's thoughts,

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.620 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and vibes,
filling the space.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.950 align:middle line:84%
They get lost in
this swirl or worry

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
that they might absorb other
people's negative energy.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.210 align:middle line:84%
This typically causes them
to want to shrink or draw

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
into themselves, but this will
have the exact opposite effect

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.170 align:middle line:90%
of what we really want.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:50.020 align:middle line:84%
What we want is to feel
contained and safe in the space

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.190 align:middle line:90%
we are in.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
If we shrink or pull
in our energy field,

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.690 align:middle line:84%
then the space will feel
like it is caving in on us.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.020 align:middle line:84%
We will feel small
and disempowered.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.040 align:middle line:84%
To feel safer, we should
instead expand our aura,

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.710 align:middle line:84%
use our power to strengthen and
reinforce the space around us

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.810 align:middle line:90%
that is our aura.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Our aura is actually
quite large,

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.200 align:middle line:84%
as large as 50 feet
in every direction,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.360 align:middle line:84%
but most people
only pay attention

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
to about a nine foot radius
or three meters around them.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.530 align:middle line:84%
When someone is within
nine feet of us,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.630 align:middle line:90%
we're keeping an eye on them.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:84%
If they get within
three feet, which

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.190 align:middle line:84%
is about one meter
or arm's length,

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:84%
now they're in our
personal space.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And within one foot, it's
considered intimate space.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.230 align:middle line:84%
If we withdraw inwards, it
diminishes the protective field

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.960 align:middle line:84%
of our aura and allows
those other energies

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:84%
to penetrate into our
personal and intimate space.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.040 align:middle line:84%
But if we instead
expand our consciousness

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.390 align:middle line:84%
out through our field, out
to at least the nine foot

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:06.790 align:middle line:84%
radius or further, now we are
enhancing the protective field

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:90%
of our aura.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
We are all capable of gathering
our energy and pushing it out

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:13.690 align:middle line:90%
through our field.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:10%
By expanding our
field of awareness

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.870 align:middle line:10%
into more of our
aura, we can deflect

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:24.100 align:middle line:10%
other people's energies,
rather than be invaded by it.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Doing this requires a
certain energetic muscle,

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.990 align:middle line:84%
which is something we have to
condition through practice.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:84%
The more we practice and
exercise this muscle,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:38.800 align:middle line:84%
the longer we will be
able to sustain and hold

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.770 align:middle line:90%
our field of expanded state.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.770 align:middle line:84%
In any of these techniques,
however, we also

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
need to honor the
principle of rhythm.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:10%
When we shift our vibration
to a different level

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:10%
than our normal baseline, it
takes energy to hold it there.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.820 align:middle line:10%
Just like any muscle
that gets exercised,

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:02.870 align:middle line:10%
until we are conditioned
in strength and stamina

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.340 align:middle line:10%
for holding higher vibrations,
which is really about shifting

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:10%
our baseline to higher levels,
we will need proper rest

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:10%
after the exercise.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Finding a rhythm that honors our
unique energy and current level

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:84%
of experience is about aligning
with higher consciousness.

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:84%
It's also important to
create a nurturing home

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:31.130 align:middle line:84%
space where we can relax our
energy back to normal and rest.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:35.570 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to strengthen
our energy and endurance?

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It starts with creating a
routine or a practice that

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:43.640 align:middle line:84%
supports us in building up our
energy body on a daily basis.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Practices like Tai Chi, Qigong,
martial arts, breath work,

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.940 align:middle line:84%
rituals, visualization, and
meditation are all helpful.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Then, by stepping onto
the path of initiation,

00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.230 align:middle line:84%
we learn more advanced tools for
strengthening our energy body,

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:84%
protecting our field,
raising our vibration,

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:90%
creating sacred space, and more.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:11.360 align:middle line:84%
As we become more conscious
of our whole aura,

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:17.180 align:middle line:84%
we can expand into our full
potential of greatness.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:21.940 align:middle line:84%
The final principle we want
to harness is momentum.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Momentum is about the movement
of mass through space and time.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:90%
Momentum is direction-oriented.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever felt stuck
on accomplishing a goal

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.600 align:middle line:84%
and wanted to generate
new momentum in order

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.250 align:middle line:90%
to reach the goal?

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.360 align:middle line:84%
In our lives, momentum
is about how fast we move

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.310 align:middle line:90%
towards our goals and desires.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.400 align:middle line:84%
The greater our
momentum, the more

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:51.650 align:middle line:84%
force it takes to slow or
stop our forward movement.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:56.760 align:middle line:84%
This momentum has to do with
inertia versus acceleration.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:34:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Inertia is a classical
physics principle that says,

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.850 align:middle line:84%
bodies at rest tend
to stay at rest

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:90%
unless acted upon by a force.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:84%
While bodies in motion, tend
to stay in motion unless

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.580 align:middle line:90%
acted upon by a force.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
In our personal
lives, inertia doesn't

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:18.340 align:middle line:84%
mean we're just a couch potato
sitting and doing nothing.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It could mean we're stuck on
one track or pattern of motion.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.030 align:middle line:84%
We might be very busy
and even productive,

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:29.880 align:middle line:90%
yet still in inertia.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.280 align:middle line:84%
How do we overcome inertia
to create new momentum?

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.170 align:middle line:90%
We must bring in a force.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.960 align:middle line:84%
A force is some kind
of catalyst that

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.070 align:middle line:84%
will accelerate us toward a
new direction of movement.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.889 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes life and
unexpected events

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.159 align:middle line:84%
can be the catalyst
for new movement,

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.830 align:middle line:84%
but waiting for
life to happen to us

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:90%
is not the path to self mastery.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
On a spiritual path of
progression, we want to ascend.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.430 align:middle line:84%
We want to break through
inertia and generate

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:05.660 align:middle line:84%
our own new momentum to
accelerate our growth.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.720 align:middle line:84%
In the mystery
school tradition, we

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.280 align:middle line:84%
as advanced spiritual
practices and methods

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to catalyze our progression
and set forces in motion that

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.640 align:middle line:90%
have otherwise been dormant.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:20.810 align:middle line:84%
These methods include things
such as rituals, initiation,

00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
activations, ascension
up the tree of life.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.260 align:middle line:84%
These are all
spiritual technologies

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:84%
that not only catalyze
accelerated growth,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.720 align:middle line:84%
they do so by helping us to
create momentum from within,

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.110 align:middle line:90%
rather than from outside of us.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Many people in the world today
rely on external pressure

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.130 align:middle line:90%
to get them moving.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
A job, status, money,
approval-seeking, societal,

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.820 align:middle line:84%
or cultural
pressures, and so on.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.730 align:middle line:84%
This pressure from the
outside can lead us

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:00.650 align:middle line:84%
astray or into the trap of
doing things that do not truly

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.900 align:middle line:90%
serve us or others.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.000 align:middle line:84%
With external
pressures, we might

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.190 align:middle line:84%
find ourselves being driven
by greed, fear, obligation,

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:15.350 align:middle line:84%
or ego, rather than by the
internal drives of passion,

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:18.950 align:middle line:84%
love, creative expansion,
and expression,

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:90%
and devotion to our purpose.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Building our own momentum
is about being aligned

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:30.290 align:middle line:84%
with our unique purpose in life,
one that is also contributing

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.840 align:middle line:90%
to a bigger collective mission.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:36.410 align:middle line:84%
Our passion and devotion
towards our unique purpose

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.710 align:middle line:84%
becomes the fuel that
helps us generate

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.100 align:middle line:90%
momentum from the inside out.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.440 align:middle line:84%
When we do this, our
power becomes sustainable

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.960 align:middle line:84%
because we are hooked in
to a stream of energy that

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:57.320 align:middle line:84%
comes from spirit, and spirit
or love is a limitless source.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Each of these phenomena
we've addressed--

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.320 align:middle line:84%
space, time,
momentum, and energy--

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.920 align:middle line:84%
can be correlated with one of
the four elements, which are

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.740 align:middle line:90%
more like forces of creation.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Space can be seen as
the elements of Earth,

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:15.120 align:middle line:90%
time is like water--

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.700 align:middle line:90%
they both flow.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.930 align:middle line:10%
Momentum is about movement
and thus, correlates with air,

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:24.050 align:middle line:10%
while energy is
represented by fire.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:28.190 align:middle line:10%
But all these elements come
from the fifth element,

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:32.270 align:middle line:10%
the quintessence, which
is love or spirit.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:36.260 align:middle line:84%
All vibrations
originate within source.

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:84%
When the rays of
creation or numbers

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.750 align:middle line:84%
are sent out from
the spiritual levels

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and the essence of that
source is limitless love, when

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:52.160 align:middle line:84%
we tap into it, we can access
an infinite supply of energy,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.770 align:middle line:90%
joy, passion, and love.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:59.810 align:middle line:84%
By tapping into it, it means
finding that love inside us,

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.020 align:middle line:84%
rather than seeking
for it outside of us.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.190 align:middle line:84%
It means attuning our
consciousness with love,

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.740 align:middle line:90%
and love is about service.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.950 align:middle line:84%
When we are filled
with love from source,

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.280 align:middle line:84%
we want to give to
others and to serve

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:21.350 align:middle line:84%
by helping them also awaken
to love, to their divinity.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to shift
vibration comes back

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:84%
to empowering ourselves as
creators of our own reality.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Part of why we are here
is to learn to manifest,

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:36.500 align:middle line:84%
to express our divine
creativity into this density,

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:40.430 align:middle line:84%
bringing spirit to be fully
embodied in the physical,

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and thereby, transforming this
Earth into a world of peace

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.370 align:middle line:90%
and prosperity for all.

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:50.060 align:middle line:84%
We can do this because
we are here in this three

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.160 align:middle line:90%
dimensional space time.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It is here that we
have the opportunity

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to harness the laws
of the universe

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and the rays of
creation from source.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:05.970 align:middle line:84%
When we remember that we are
not just these physical bodies,

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and when we stop identifying
so much with being only human,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:16.220 align:middle line:84%
then we will no longer be bound
by the illusions of limitation.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.260 align:middle line:90%
We are energy.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.120 align:middle line:90%
We are spirit.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.860 align:middle line:90%
We are love.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.230 align:middle line:90%
We are eternal.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:84%
The more we live into
our divine potential

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and recognize that the
power is within us,

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:36.470 align:middle line:84%
the quicker we will ascend
to becoming superhuman.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:40.280 align:middle line:84%
From a metaphysical perspective,
transforming our lives

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:43.610 align:middle line:84%
and our world into
our ultimate potential

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:46.310 align:middle line:90%
all comes down to one thing--

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:48.435 align:middle line:90%
embodying our God self.

00:39:48.435 --> 00:39:51.190 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we dive
deeper into how to awaken

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and embody our full
divine potential.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.510 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with me in this
episode of "Mystery Teachings."
