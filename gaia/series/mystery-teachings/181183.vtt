00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
and this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:10%
What are we made of?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:10%
And why are we here?

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we dig
deeper into how consciousness

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:10%
works through the fundamental
components of our universe

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.665 align:middle line:10%
to fulfill a purpose.

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
In ancient times,
everything in the universe

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
was believed to be made of five
elements, earth, water, air,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:84%
fire, and ether, also
referred to as void.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
Some variation of these
five classical elements

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
was found in every
culture of antiquity.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The universe was
relatively simple.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
Then with the
scientific revolution

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:84%
through various chemistry
and physics experiments,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:90%
scientists discovered atoms.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They concluded that the universe
is not so simple after all,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually composed
of over 100 different types

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.320 align:middle line:90%
of elements.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:10%
But of these elements,
only two of them

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.860 align:middle line:10%
make up the majority
of visible matter

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.980 align:middle line:10%
in the universe,
which is about 75%

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.800 align:middle line:10%
hydrogen and 25% helium,
the two lightest elements.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
All the heavier
elements, which are

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
made in the alchemical furnaces
of stars and supernovae,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.600 align:middle line:84%
comprise only a small fraction
of a percent of our universe.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet, many of these
elements are vital for life

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.810 align:middle line:90%
as we know it.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:90%
What about us?

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.390 align:middle line:90%
What are we made of?

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We often hear the saying
that we are made of stardust,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:90%
and it's true.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are
comprised primarily

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
of the four elements of life,
oxygen, carbon, hydrogen,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.750 align:middle line:84%
and nitrogen, with small
amounts of calcium, phosphorus,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.350 align:middle line:84%
potassium, and a
few other elements.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.920 align:middle line:84%
About 90% of what
we are made of came

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:84%
from the stars that exploded
billions of years ago.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Can you feel that
connection to the stars?

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
In the last 100 or
so years, scientists

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
have searched even deeper into
the fundamental building blocks

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.870 align:middle line:90%
to discover the subatomic world.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:10%
Through the quantum revolution,
the standard model of physics

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:10%
was developed,
giving us an array

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:10%
of 17 elementary particles
plus their antiparticles.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
These include 12 fermions,
the building blocks

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.570 align:middle line:84%
of ordinary matter, which
include six types of quarks

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:90%
and six types of leptons.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:10%
In addition, there
are five bosons,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:10%
which are the force carriers
that mediate interactions

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:10%
between the particles.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
These particles
are characterized

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.920 align:middle line:84%
by their type,
mass, charge, spin,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.000 align:middle line:90%
and quantum flavor or color.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.490 align:middle line:84%
But as physicists began
smashing particles together

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.950 align:middle line:84%
at higher and higher
energies, they

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:84%
discovered more
strange particles,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
and things became
confusing again.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Around the same time came
quantum field theory,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
which said that the
universe is made of fields

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
rather than particles.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.870 align:middle line:84%
These fields vibrate at
different frequencies

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
to produce the different
particles and forces.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:84%
In their lowest energy
state, these fields

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:84%
have a zero-point
energy, which is not zero

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:84%
due to quantum fluctuations
from the uncertainty principle.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
This reintroduced the
concept of the ether back in.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, physicists didn't
really like that,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.270 align:middle line:84%
because it brought infinities
into their calculations.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So they tried to ignore it with
a mathematical trick called

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.730 align:middle line:90%
renormalization.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the last few decades,
various string theories

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.730 align:middle line:84%
have taken this concept
of vibrating fields

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%
to a whole new level.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.100 align:middle line:84%
They introduced the
idea of hyperspace, a 10

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.920 align:middle line:84%
or 11 dimensional
space where everything

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:84%
becomes like musical
notes on a cosmic violin

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.950 align:middle line:90%
string or membrane.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a rather elegant
and beautiful way

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.100 align:middle line:90%
to think of our universe.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.815 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of the
ancient Pythagorean

00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and Egyptian mystery
school teachings

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
on the laws of harmony,
music, and sacred geometry

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that said that everything
in nature and the cosmos

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.050 align:middle line:90%
follows these laws.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Our universe is a
cosmic symphony playing

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
the music of the spheres.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And according to
string theories,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.880 align:middle line:84%
this is likely true at the
quantum levels as well.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.980 align:middle line:84%
We also learned that in
the last few decades,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
scientists have discovered
that our universe is

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:84%
composed of much stranger
things than we ever realized.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Current models now focus
on three components

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
that make up our universe,
visible matter, dark matter,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.810 align:middle line:90%
and dark energy.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything described
in the standard model

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.360 align:middle line:84%
of physics and
the periodic chart

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
are what make up
the visible matter.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:10%
But this only amounts
to 5% of our universe,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.410 align:middle line:10%
while dark matter makes
up 27%, and dark energy,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.480 align:middle line:10%
the intrinsic energy
of the vacuum,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:10%
makes up the other
68% of our universe.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Yet science today is so
focused on just physical causes

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and effects that they
neglect or even deny

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
that there might be anything
beyond the physical.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Are we just products
of physics, chemistry,

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:90%
biology, and psychology?

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Or are we more than that?

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%
What about soul and spirit?

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Do they exist?

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.470 align:middle line:84%
Do they persist
after the body dies?

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:90%
If so, what are they?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalistic Tree
of Life has a pattern

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that can be applied fractally
at many scales, including to who

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:90%
and what we are.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.970 align:middle line:10%
On the Tree of Life,
the physical round

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.130 align:middle line:10%
is only the very
bottom of the tree,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:10%
and there are many
dimensions and planes

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:10%
of higher frequency beyond
what our physical senses

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.180 align:middle line:10%
and detectors can measure.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.620 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistically, the
same source energy

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.410 align:middle line:84%
of Ein Sof that flows
through the universe

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.900 align:middle line:90%
also flows through us.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
We could equate that
essence to our spirit,

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:84%
which is everywhere,
infinite, and eternal.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
In all ancient mystery
school traditions,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.000 align:middle line:84%
soul and spirit are
two distinct things.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:90%
How are they different?

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's define spirit as the
eternal essence that comes

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.160 align:middle line:90%
from source and is one with it.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.980 align:middle line:84%
In this oneness
state, spirit is often

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
assigned to the top
of the Tree of Life.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Vibrationally speaking,
it is the opposite end

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
of the spectrum
from the physical.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic
principle of polarity

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.220 align:middle line:90%
says everything is dual.

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.750 align:middle line:90%
Everything has poles.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.600 align:middle line:10%
Everything has its
pair of opposites.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.660 align:middle line:10%
But it also says that
spirit and matter

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.550 align:middle line:10%
are but two poles of the same
thing, the intermediate planes

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.180 align:middle line:10%
being merely degrees
of vibration.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
This relates to
Einstein's equation,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.790 align:middle line:84%
e equals mc squared,
which says that energy,

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
or spirit, and matter can be
transformed into one another.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Only in this case, spirit
is at such a high frequency

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:84%
that we don't yet know how to
physically detect it directly.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:10%
What then is soul?

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.520 align:middle line:10%
Well, soul encompasses
all the levels

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:10%
in between the top and the
bottom of the Tree of Life.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:84%
Soul is a mediator that
bridges and communicates

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.860 align:middle line:90%
between spirit and body.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.320 align:middle line:84%
It includes the
functions of the mind.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to become conscious
of this physical experience.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:84%
It also contains our
individuality and personality.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
We could apply a modern analogy
of a radio transmission.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:90%
Spirit is like the broadcaster.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.550 align:middle line:10%
Soul is all the radio signals
that carry information

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:10%
at different
frequencies or stations,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:10%
while body is the hardware that
receives the signals depending

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:10%
on where the dial is set.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Various alchemical traditions
from both East and West

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:90%
talked about three essentials.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.620 align:middle line:84%
These are the same as
spirit, soul, and body.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:10%
In Western alchemy, they
called them philosophical

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.400 align:middle line:10%
mercury, sulfur, and
salt. Paracelsus,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.340 align:middle line:10%
the great alchemist,
initiate, and father

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.400 align:middle line:10%
of modern pharmacology,
said this.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
"The soul unites the two
contraries, body and spirit,

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.430 align:middle line:84%
and changes them
into one essence."

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.860 align:middle line:84%
If we put these three essentials
into a more modern terminology,

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:13.260 align:middle line:84%
we could call them energy,
consciousness, and matter.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But as suggested by
physicist David Bohm,

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
perhaps all energy,
consciousness, and matter

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:84%
are emergent from
an implicate order.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
They are really one thing.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps as string
theories are proposing,

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
all things are just
different vibrations

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.490 align:middle line:84%
plucked on the strings
of a cosmic symphony.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, in alchemy, Kabbalah,
and other mystical traditions,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.710 align:middle line:84%
all these forces
and elements derive

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:90%
from two primary generators.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy calls it the
fixed and the volatile.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah calls it
form and force,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
or feminine and masculine.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Taoism calls it yin and yang.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Science calls it
expansion and contraction.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Yet these two
generators, in turn,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:90%
come from the one, the prima.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And while it is true
that all is one,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.850 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to this level
of density that we live in,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.160 align:middle line:84%
isn't that kind
of oversimplifying

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.050 align:middle line:90%
what life is about?

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Why are we here?

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:90%
Why did all of this come to be?

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose of it?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Is there a purpose?

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical
tradition would say

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:84%
that we are here
to master the art

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and science of transformation
and raising vibration,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.480 align:middle line:84%
that we are here to learn to
harness the power of the three

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
essentials, purify them,
harmonize them, and then bring

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
them together into a
perfected form, also called

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:90%
the philosopher's stone.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.620 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah has a similar idea,
but it is more specifically

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.950 align:middle line:84%
focused on the raising
of our own soul

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
up to higher planes
of spirit and uniting

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:90%
with our divine source.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
Simultaneously, we are
also here to embody spirit

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
into the physical body
and thereby elevate

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.790 align:middle line:90%
the vibration of the physical.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.405 align:middle line:84%
Another way this is talked about
is creating heaven on Earth.

00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, as a Kabbalist
goes through the cycles

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.900 align:middle line:84%
of this spiritual alchemy,
raising up to spirit

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing spirit
back down into body

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:84%
through the mediating
vehicle of the soul,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
we ultimately become what
is called the Adam Kadmon,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:90%
or the perfected godlike human.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient mystery
school traditions

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:84%
of different lineages
have similar teachings

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and employ a variety
of methods to help

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:84%
us achieve such evolution
and transformation.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Are these just mystical
teachings to give us

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
some sense of meaning,
purpose, and comfort in life?

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Or could there really
be something to it?

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Are there any clues that
we can gain from science

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:90%
to confirm any of this?

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160 align:middle line:90%
Actually, yes, there is.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.700 align:middle line:84%
They call our universe
the Goldilocks universe,

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.980 align:middle line:84%
because its conditions
are just right

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:84%
for life and consciousness
to thrive in it.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.450 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, there are over
20 fundamental constants that

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:90%
are perfectly tuned for life.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
These include things like
the mass of particles,

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
the strength of the four
forces, the speed of light,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
the energy density of
our universe, and so on.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.230 align:middle line:84%
All these values lie
within a very narrow range

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.310 align:middle line:84%
of what makes life and the
universe we know possible.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
If just one of those numbers
was tuned a little off-key

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and fell outside
that narrow range,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
then our universe
might not exist.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Stars would never
have developed.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:59.710 align:middle line:84%
Atomic elements would not
have fused or bound together.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The universe could
have flown apart.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
Earth might have been flipped
over or frozen too fast.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
DNA would never have had a
chance to form, and life as we

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.880 align:middle line:90%
know it would be impossible.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Not only is our universe
in the Goldilocks zones,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.330 align:middle line:90%
but so is our Earth.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
Earth sits at the just
right distance from the sun

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.190 align:middle line:90%
to allow for liquid water.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:27.120 align:middle line:84%
It has the just right weight
and gravitational field

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to hold the
atmosphere we breathe.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
Any smaller, and it would
not hold oxygen. Any larger,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:84%
it would be too
poisonous for us.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Earth also has the just right
amount of oceans, temperature,

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
plate tectonics,
tilt of its axis,

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and so on needed to
host intelligent life.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but the
moon is the just right size

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize Earth's
orbit, preventing it

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
from having too many
cataclysmic changes.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And the moon is also the perfect
relative size and distance

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.860 align:middle line:84%
from the Earth to be able
to fully eclipse the sun,

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.235 align:middle line:84%
even though the sun is
massive by comparison.

00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Equally important is the
presence, position, and size

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.910 align:middle line:90%
of Jupiter.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Due to its large
gravity field, Jupiter

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
has cleaned out our solar
system from asteroids and space

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.350 align:middle line:90%
debris.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.250 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter acted like Earth's
benevolent protector,

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
helping prevent many
asteroids from hitting it.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Not only is Earth in
the Goldilocks zone

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system,
but it also resides

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
at the just right distance
from the center of our galaxy.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
We are about 2/3 of the
way out from a black hole

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:90%
at the center of the Milky Way.

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:84%
If we were much closer,
we'd be scorched

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:84%
by the intense radiation
that surrounds the center,

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.080 align:middle line:84%
but much farther, and we'd
lack the higher elements

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:90%
necessary to sustain life.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:10%
As physicist Freeman
Dyson once put it,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:10%
"It's as if the universe
knew we were coming."

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Could this mean that
there is intelligence

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.490 align:middle line:90%
behind this universe?

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Or is it just a lucky string
of random coincidences?

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the
universe was designed

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
for life and consciousness
according to some grand plan

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is what scientists call the
strong anthropic principle,

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.070 align:middle line:84%
while the weak anthropic
principle simply acknowledges

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.280 align:middle line:84%
the fine-tuning
towards life but says

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.395 align:middle line:84%
that it is by the laws of
nature rather than by design.

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course, there is the
materialist atheistic view

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.310 align:middle line:84%
that dismisses the anthropic
principle altogether,

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:90%
calling it mystical mumbo jumbo.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But the only explanation
the materialists

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:84%
have been able to come up with
for the overwhelming amount

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
of lucky coincidences
is that our universe

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.430 align:middle line:84%
must be just one of a
vast number of universes

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.140 align:middle line:90%
in the multiverse.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:84%
In the multiverse,
they say there

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.310 align:middle line:84%
will be all possible
tunings of universes,

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:11.520 align:middle line:84%
so the fact that our
universe is tuned for life

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:90%
is not significant.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:84%
But the multiverse ideas are
not sufficient to explain away

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:84%
the existence of
universal consciousness

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:90%
or intelligent source.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it appear that the
physical laws of our universe

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
are finely tuned as if by
design, but the very substance

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.670 align:middle line:84%
of physicality itself
seems more like ideas

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.710 align:middle line:90%
than solid particles.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:10%
As Werner Heisenberg, one of the
founders of quantum mechanics,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:10%
said, "The smallest
units of matter

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:10%
are, in fact, not
physical objects.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.290 align:middle line:10%
They are ideas."

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:10%
Another Nobel Prize
winning scientist

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.440 align:middle line:10%
who actually started his
career as a materialist

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:10%
and then later changed his
view is Harvard professor

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.830 align:middle line:10%
of biology George Wald.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.040 align:middle line:10%
The results of his research
brought him to the conclusion

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:10.980 align:middle line:10%
that "mind has existed always
as the matrix; the source

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:10%
and condition of
physical reality.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
The stuff of which physical
reality is composed

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:90%
is mind-stuff."

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Then he hints at
a purpose for it

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
all by saying, "It is
mind that has composed

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.180 align:middle line:84%
a physical universe
that breeds life and so

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.800 align:middle line:84%
eventually evolves creatures
that know and create.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:84%
In them the universe
begins to know itself."

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.300 align:middle line:90%
What does all this point to?

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:84%
That mind or intelligence
source is the architect

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.430 align:middle line:84%
of all existence,
while matter and life

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.540 align:middle line:84%
are the intentional result
from the ideas expressed

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.370 align:middle line:90%
by that mind.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:10%
This is aligned with that
first hermetic principle

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.930 align:middle line:10%
that says, "The all is mind.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:03.060 align:middle line:10%
The universe is mental.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:10%
All the phenomenal
world or universe

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.590 align:middle line:10%
is simply a mental creation."

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.970 align:middle line:84%
The real question is, how
does this mind create,

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:16.130 align:middle line:90%
by what mechanism?

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:21.890 align:middle line:84%
We've explored how all forms and
forces emerge as fluctuations

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:84%
from the quantum sea and how
through the observer effect,

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.780 align:middle line:84%
we can collapse the waveform
to manifest things out

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:90%
of the quantum sea.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:10%
Today's standard
model of physics

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.970 align:middle line:10%
describes these forms and
forces as fermions and bosons.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.440 align:middle line:10%
Fermions include all particles
of ordinary matter like quarks,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:10%
electrons, neutrinos,
protons, and so forth,

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.680 align:middle line:10%
while bosons are the
force carriers that

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.660 align:middle line:10%
mediate interactions via
the four physical forces.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.130 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It all begins in
the quantum sea,

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:84%
which holds all memory,
information, and potentials

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.300 align:middle line:84%
of what can come
to be, while mind,

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
eternal source, or
universal consciousness

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.990 align:middle line:90%
directs the creative forces.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Before the beginning,
all potentials,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:84%
everything that
could come to be,

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:90%
was already there as potential.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.940 align:middle line:84%
These potentials
were just latent.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:90%
They weren't activated.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
In mystery school
Kabbalah, we say

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.690 align:middle line:84%
that before the
moment of let there

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.340 align:middle line:84%
be light and the big bang,
everything was in darkness.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.760 align:middle line:84%
It was all there
already as potentials,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:90%
but the lights were out.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.440 align:middle line:90%
It was as if things were asleep.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Imagine walking into an
unexplored pitch-black room.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:51.380 align:middle line:84%
We can be aware and sense
that things are there,

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:90%
but do we know what they are?

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.330 align:middle line:90%
No, we don't.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
In order to really
know what they are,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.350 align:middle line:90%
we must turn on the lights.

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.710 align:middle line:10%
Similarly, the mind of Ein
Sof went into the darkness

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:10%
and sensed all these potentials.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like
how in our own mind

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.910 align:middle line:10%
we can sense in the
unexpressed depths of our being

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:16.085 align:middle line:10%
that there is a latent
potential within.

00:20:16.085 --> 00:20:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:25.350 align:middle line:90%
In sensing, we become aware.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:31.210 align:middle line:84%
Sentience, the ability to sense
and interact, is universal.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:36.750 align:middle line:84%
It is found at all scales, from
the macrocosm to the microcosm,

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:90%
even down to the quantum level.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.545 align:middle line:84%
Sentience is the
foundation of awareness,

00:20:42.545 --> 00:20:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and it is an essential
aspect of mind.

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:90%
What follows awareness?

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, once we become
aware that something

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.280 align:middle line:90%
is there, what comes next?

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the will to know, to awaken
and express that potential.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:84%
As the will or
desire bubbles up,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
a vibration ripples
through the quantum sea.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
What is this bubbling
up, this ripple?

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
It's that first pause, the
fluctuation in the quantum

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
vacuum that initiated the big
bang, the will of Ein Sof,

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
the infinite intelligence
source, the first observer

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:29.100 align:middle line:84%
moved upon the quantum sea
or the waters of the deep.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
This will then
activates something.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.750 align:middle line:90%
What does it activate?

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.450 align:middle line:84%
First, it activates
consciousness.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Second, it activates a force.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do we mean
by consciousness here?

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
How is it different
from awareness?

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.690 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like
when we're just

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:90%
starting to wake up from sleep.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.530 align:middle line:84%
We begin coming to awareness,
but our eyes are closed

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.450 align:middle line:90%
and it is still dark.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:90%
We sense things.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:22:00.100 align:middle line:84%
We become aware of ourself
and our environment,

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
but we're not fully
awake and moving yet.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.354 align:middle line:84%
As we start to move, we open
our eyes and become conscious.

00:22:09.354 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is that coming
into awareness of something

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:90%
that is already there.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness
observes more actively

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.300 align:middle line:90%
and directly than awareness.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness can also direct
the will to do something,

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:90%
like turn on the lights.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But directing the will
implies something else.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
It implies that there is a
thought or intent behind it,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:90%
such as let there be light.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does this
intention get carried out?

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it requires
a force, and forces

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:84%
are mediated through bosons,
so bosons were activated.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And these bosons, or
forces, are sent out,

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:84%
and it causes the
lights to turn on.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
the lights turn on?

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:10%
It wakes up all those
potentials that were

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:10%
lying dormant in the darkness.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
We were also one of
those potentials.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.020 align:middle line:90%
We had to be.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we couldn't
have come to be.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.960 align:middle line:84%
But by saying we,
what do I mean?

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.604 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:23:20.604 --> 00:23:22.290 align:middle line:90%
We are energy.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:24.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything is energy.

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:90%
But what is energy?

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Well, energy is eternal.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the laws of physics
says energy cannot be created

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:90%
or destroyed.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.460 align:middle line:90%
It can only be transformed.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
This means energy
is eternal essence.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
In metaphysical terms, we call
our eternal essence our spirit.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.920 align:middle line:90%
We are eternal beings.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:51.450 align:middle line:84%
We have never been born, and
therefore we can never die.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:55.770 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the core concepts
of mystery school teachings.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And in that spirit
essence, we are all one.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So in saying we, we're not
just talking about us humans.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.770 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
universe and all its forms.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.460 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
When the lights
turned on, our spirit

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.320 align:middle line:90%
woke up and opened its eyes.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness
became activated.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.630 align:middle line:84%
We looked around
and witnessed what

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.450 align:middle line:84%
was happening, the
cosmos beginning

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to be created by Ein Sof.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.670 align:middle line:90%
What happened when we saw this?

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.670 align:middle line:84%
It stimulated a thought
in our consciousness.

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.160 align:middle line:90%
What thought?

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:90%
We thought, create me.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I want to be created,
meaning I want to live.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a part
of this creation

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:90%
in the physical universe.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And with our thought, we
reached out to Ein Sof

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:90%
and we shouted, create me.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
In doing so, we
activated another force.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And that force
kicked off a cascade

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:84%
of events that adjusted
the tuning of the universe

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.420 align:middle line:90%
so that we could be.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.250 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:84%
While Ein Sof's will is
what initiated the big bang

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and the creation
of this universe,

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:13.680 align:middle line:84%
could it be that it
was our will that

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.440 align:middle line:84%
initiated its
fine-tuning, which is what

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.940 align:middle line:84%
allows for physical forms,
life, and intelligent beings

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:90%
to evolve?

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.940 align:middle line:84%
If so, then that means
our thought eventually

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.120 align:middle line:90%
led to matter being generated.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts create matter, and
matter is made of fermions.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.090 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just any thought.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:43.650 align:middle line:84%
It must be coherent thought
from higher consciousness, which

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is why it's a lot more
challenging to do this

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.660 align:middle line:84%
from the level of
consciousness most people

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.070 align:middle line:90%
are operating at today.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.730 align:middle line:84%
But given all of
this, it helps explain

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:84%
why the Three
Initiates, in writing

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.680 align:middle line:84%
about the principle
of mentalism,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
said that "This
principle explains

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:05.250 align:middle line:84%
the true nature of
energy, power, and matter,

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and why and how all of these
are subordinate to the mastery

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.400 align:middle line:90%
of mind."

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.770 align:middle line:84%
This mastery is what
true mystery schools

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:90%
train initiates to achieve.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So why did we think
we wanted to be a part

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.420 align:middle line:90%
of this physical experience?

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Is there purpose to it all?

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.130 align:middle line:84%
To answer that, let's turn back
to science for another clue.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.430 align:middle line:84%
After the big bang, a myriad
of particles and forces

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.580 align:middle line:84%
were ushered in from
the quantum vacuum.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.880 align:middle line:84%
As the universe expanded
and temperatures cooled,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:84%
those particles were
drawn together in order

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.070 align:middle line:90%
to release excess energy.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:45.740 align:middle line:84%
At first, it was
matter and antimatter

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that drew together and then
exploded into photons of light.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But due to there somehow being
more matter than antimatter,

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.130 align:middle line:84%
another example of the
very fortunate fine-tuning

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
in our universe, eventually
the matter came to dominate.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.200 align:middle line:84%
At that point, different
types of particles

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:90%
then needed to bond.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We often hear the saying
that in the physical,

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.070 align:middle line:90%
opposites attract.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And while that is
true in some cases,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:90%
it's not the whole truth.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics tells us that
the things that draw together

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.380 align:middle line:84%
are usually of a
complementary nature.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:27.980 align:middle line:84%
First, protons and
neutrons are fused together

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.480 align:middle line:90%
by the strong force.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
Both are made of quarks
and are somewhat similar,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:90%
but they have different charges.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Next, electrons, which
are very different,

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:84%
join the nuclei through electric
attraction to create atoms.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.520 align:middle line:84%
Through bonding, they
are able to create

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.940 align:middle line:90%
more stable and balanced forms.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, atoms
then joined to form

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.430 align:middle line:84%
molecules, molecules
combined to form DNA,

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:58.670 align:middle line:84%
and all of it ultimately
leading to life.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.530 align:middle line:90%
What is this telling us?

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It means that we are meant
to seek union or bonding

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.220 align:middle line:90%
with complementary others.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Rather than seeking
our opposite or seeking

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.590 align:middle line:84%
people who are just
like us, we should

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.920 align:middle line:84%
seek to find the people
who complement us.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Opposites often explode
in a blaze of glory

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:84%
like particles
and antiparticles.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Same same may be comfortable,
but not so stable or useful

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.260 align:middle line:90%
or long-lasting on its own.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:33.800 align:middle line:84%
But with our complements, we can
fortify and balance each other.

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We can find the synergy needed
to build towards greater life.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But why come into this
physical experience

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.790 align:middle line:90%
in order to seek bonding?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Didn't we come
from unity already?

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.120 align:middle line:90%
We did.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
But in our original
unity, everything

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.880 align:middle line:90%
was a homogeneous oneness.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.640 align:middle line:84%
There were no
distinctions and therefore

00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:01.280 align:middle line:84%
no interactions, no tension,
no progression, no alchemy.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Interaction leads to
knowledge and understanding.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.840 align:middle line:84%
We and the universe
come to know ourself

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.260 align:middle line:84%
through reflection and
interaction with our lives

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and with others.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember, even the
quarks are sentient.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.190 align:middle line:84%
At the quantum
level, interactions

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.650 align:middle line:90%
are taking place all the time.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Particles exchange information
through those interactions

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and then act according
to the laws of nature.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.060 align:middle line:90%
Information equals knowledge.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Each ripple, each
interaction, and its results

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.440 align:middle line:84%
are recorded upon
the quantum sea.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.600 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, there
is a formula that

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.790 align:middle line:84%
rests at the core of all
transformation and progression.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:10%
It's called solve et
coagula, which means

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.970 align:middle line:10%
to separate and recombine.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to successfully
harmonize and unite

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:01.370 align:middle line:84%
different essences
in a synergistic way.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:06.650 align:middle line:84%
The fuel of alchemy is drawn
from the tension that arises

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.590 align:middle line:90%
between different essences.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the goals is to
harness this tension

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and harmonize the
differences, bringing them

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.470 align:middle line:90%
into a perfect union.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
When the philosopher's
stone is truly achieved,

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.150 align:middle line:84%
then the bond will be
indestructible and based

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.350 align:middle line:90%
upon eternal essence.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
In today's terminology
of quantum physics,

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.850 align:middle line:84%
we'd say this is about union
through complementarity.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:84%
This is the alchemy or
transformational process

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
taking place in our universe,
from the prima of the quantum

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.690 align:middle line:84%
vacuum to the materia of our
physical world to seeking

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:52.240 align:middle line:84%
the philosopher's
stone through alchemy,

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate union of
all these shattered

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.240 align:middle line:84%
pieces into a oneness that is
perfect and indestructible.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah calls this
tikkun, or to rectify,

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.780 align:middle line:84%
to heal the shattered vessels
left over after the big bang.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Each of us contains shards from
those shattered vessels within.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And our mission is to heal and
repair the pieces in ourselves,

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.530 align:middle line:84%
especially within
our soul, and then

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.290 align:middle line:90%
to help others do the same.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Only when we in
our diverse forms

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:84%
can reclaim our wholeness, both
individually and collectively,

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:38.380 align:middle line:84%
will we then be able to rectify
the shattering in our world.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.040 align:middle line:84%
The healing of our world
is a collective mission,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:46.810 align:middle line:84%
yet each of us has a unique
role to play in that mission.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:49.690 align:middle line:84%
The question we should
all be asking ourselves

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.350 align:middle line:84%
is whether we are on track
with fulfilling our unique role

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.280 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.070 align:middle line:84%
We can only answer
this for ourselves,

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:84%
but clearly the world
desperately needs healing

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and has a ways to go before
the vessel is repaired.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.080 align:middle line:84%
We each are responsible
for a part of that healing.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:84%
We are not here to be the
same as everyone else.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:19.950 align:middle line:84%
We are here to be different,
to express our uniqueness.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.800 align:middle line:84%
It often takes
quantum leaps of faith

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to step onto our true path of
purpose and personal mastery.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It requires facing
challenges and feeling

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.580 align:middle line:84%
the grind of the different
forces and aspects of life

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that throw us into the fire,
then douse us in the water,

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.930 align:middle line:84%
and then bang us around
a bit until we become

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:47.100 align:middle line:90%
sharp and strong as a sword.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.440 align:middle line:84%
If we run from those
challenges, then we

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.470 align:middle line:84%
miss the opportunity
to become stronger.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:84%
But when we face
our fears and break

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.650 align:middle line:84%
through our inner
resistance to moving forward

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.860 align:middle line:84%
in the direction
of our dreams, that

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
is what prepares us to
fulfill those dreams.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.950 align:middle line:84%
What dreams are inside you
waiting to be fulfilled?

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.040 align:middle line:84%
As Henry David Thoreau
wrote, "Go confidently

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.200 align:middle line:90%
in the direction of your dreams.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:10%
Live the life you've imagined."

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:10%
To summarize, what's
the purpose of it all?

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Three things, mind
coming to know itself,

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:84%
through the expression
of all the potentials

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.400 align:middle line:84%
in their myriad
forms, and finally

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.090 align:middle line:84%
progression and
transformation through healing

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and the alchemy of life until
we achieve our full potential

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.170 align:middle line:84%
and carry out the mission
that we are here for,

00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
both individually
and collectively.

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:52.340 align:middle line:84%
In physics, the philosopher's
stone or holy grail

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:84%
is to discover the grand
unified theory of everything,

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:84%
a single equation that
unifies and derives

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.230 align:middle line:90%
all phenomena in our universe.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:07.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.496 align:middle line:90%
