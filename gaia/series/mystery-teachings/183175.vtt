00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.800 align:middle line:84%
How do we tap into
superconscious states

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of awareness?

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:10%
How does this really work?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:10%
The key to this is
in our mind and soul.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
But it also involves being
able to consciously access more

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:90%
of our full brain capacity.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Doing so requires that
we rewire our brain

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:84%
for optimal
functioning and break

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:84%
through limitations in our
previous neural conditioning.

we begin exploring

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:84%
how to build
bridges and pathways

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.300 align:middle line:84%
between our ordinary
consciousness and transcendent

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.930 align:middle line:84%

awareness.

We explored in season 1
how the universe consists

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
of a unified field of sentient
awareness and intelligence,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.410 align:middle line:84%
or as hermeticists
say, the all is mind.

Physicist Menas
Kafatos identifies

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
the sentient awareness as the
foundation of the universe.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.120 align:middle line:84%
It is the source of
information and energy

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that gets transmitted
throughout the cosmos.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But like a fish whose whole life
has been lived in the water,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.470 align:middle line:84%
we may not have awareness
of the sea of consciousness

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.600 align:middle line:90%
we are swimming in.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:90%
So how do we become aware?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:84%
First, we must
realize that sentience

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is found at all levels, from
the subatomic to the cosmic.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
This sentience is then organized
into systems of hierarchies.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:84%
On the most basic
end of the spectrum,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
sentience means
something has the ability

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:84%
to interact with
its environment,

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.400 align:middle line:84%
receiving information and
responding to it in some way.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
An example of this on
the subatomic level

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
is how quantum particles
interact with each other

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.190 align:middle line:84%
through force carriers that
carry certain information.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:84%
All of this is governed by
and responsive to the laws

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:90%
of physics.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
As we move up the
spectrum of hierarchies

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to more complex
forms of sentience,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
we encounter various
minerals and crystals,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:84%
then single-celled organisms,
plants, animals, humans,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
planetary systems, and
beyond, all the way

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:90%
to the universal mind.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.990 align:middle line:84%
The cosmos consists
of the sum total

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:84%
of all these nested
systems of sentience.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
This perspective of
a sentient universe

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:84%
challenges that
materialist perspective

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
which views the capacity
for consciousness

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
more as an epiphenomenon
of the brain.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
They say that the material
or physical comes first,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and then consciousness
derives from it.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.570 align:middle line:84%
Now in the hermetic view,
where the all is mind,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
well, mind is primary, while
the material world is simply

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.945 align:middle line:84%
one macrosystem manifested
within the one mind.

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we go any
further with this,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
let's distinguish the difference
between two states of mind--

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
namely consciousness
and awareness.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is about
awakened perception.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It is the goal of
our life experience,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.020 align:middle line:84%
while awareness here is
defined as the universal field

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:90%
of intelligence and sentience.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Awareness-- we can think of it
more as an inner experience.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Like when we're coming
out of a sleep state

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
we start to wake up, but
our eyes are still closed.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:10%
At this point, we're self
aware, recognizing, I'm here.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm awake.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:10%
This moment is
like the I am state

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.190 align:middle line:10%
of awareness at the top
of the Tree of Life--

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.925 align:middle line:10%
that first emanation
from the source.

00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:90%
, it is the center of being now.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we open
our eyes, we become

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
conscious of the things
that are outside of us--

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
our environment and our ability
to expand and express ourselves

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.450 align:middle line:90%
into the outer.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
When awake, we can
take in information

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
from our surroundings and from
other forms of intelligence

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and the various stimuli that are
coming in to us from outside.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.290 align:middle line:90%
This is consciousness.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.840 align:middle line:84%
It is that more active
experience with our eyes open.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is a state of
being fully awake and aware.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We might compare it to
the beta gamma brainwave

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
states that allow us to be
aware of self and others.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
But awareness itself is the
foundation to consciousness.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It is more like the alpha
theta brainwave states

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:90%
of inward experience.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.320 align:middle line:84%
How do we begin
optimizing our brain?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, it begins with making
the correct connections

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
or bridges between our brain,
our mind, and the one mind.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.870 align:middle line:84%
When we can strengthen and
solidify these connections

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.170 align:middle line:84%
by stimulating our brain
and neurological system

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
with the proper
vibrational energies--

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
these can include energies such
as light, sound, touch, breath,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
aromas, all tuned in to
the correct frequencies.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Through this journey,
we'll explore

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
seven bridges or connective
circuits between our brain

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
regions and various
levels of consciousness.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.750 align:middle line:84%
The goal of this
exploration is to forge

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
a path that leads us from our
regular experience of life

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.400 align:middle line:84%
back to the feeling of oneness
with universal consciousness.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
The first bridge on this
journey begins with our mind.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.580 align:middle line:90%
What is the mind?

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And how is it connected
to consciousness

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.490 align:middle line:90%
and our brain-body system?

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The mind is a complex framework
of thoughts and emotions

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.905 align:middle line:84%
that directly interface
with the brain-body system.

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But first, it connects
in and through our soul.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:84%
The primary function of the mind
is to become aware of stimulus

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
coming in from spirit
or from the one mind,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and then to direct our actions
according to intention.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The mind has different
levels to it,

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and so to make it
easy for us here,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.480 align:middle line:84%
let's just try to call them the
lower mind and the higher mind.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:84%
The lower mind is programmed
through life experiences.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It is influenced by our
education, our expectations,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.580 align:middle line:84%
desires, habits, belief systems,
and emotional attachments.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It forms part of
our personality,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:84%
which is the mask we identify
with in our outer life.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the higher mind,
on the other hand,

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
is influenced directly
by spirit, or true self.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:84%
It communicates to us
through subtle energies

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.050 align:middle line:90%
of our inner world.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
We tap into these in meditation
and through intuition

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
or a sense of purpose,
meaning, and potential.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Our higher mind is part of
our original patterning,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.450 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual blueprint.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:84%
This blueprint contains
our purpose, our contracts,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and our whole reason
for being here.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, these two
levels of our mind--

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.070 align:middle line:84%
higher and lower--
they help us to operate

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.500 align:middle line:84%
within this physical
density, and also

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.800 align:middle line:84%
to connect with
our eternal spirit.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:10%
We can represent them
on the Tree of Life

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.050 align:middle line:10%
as the lower two triads.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:10%
The physical body is
at the very bottom

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.000 align:middle line:10%
of the tree, the bottom sphere.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.230 align:middle line:10%
The lower mind is the
lowest of the three triads.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.590 align:middle line:10%
The higher mind is what
we call the middle triad,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:10%
while the spirit
is the upper triad.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.080 align:middle line:84%
In addition to this arrangement
on the Tree of Life,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:90%
where is our mind located?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
If it's on the Tree
of Life, that also

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:26.260 align:middle line:84%
means it is in our
physical and spiritual DNA.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.410 align:middle line:84%
It's in every cell of the
body, not just the brain.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
But it's not only
the physical body.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
The mind extends beyond the body
and reaches out to the infinite

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.275 align:middle line:90%
to touch the one mind.

00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's try to make this
more relatable, here.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
A helpful analogy
for understanding

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
this dynamic system is that of
a radio broadcasting analogy.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Instead of a sea of
interacting waves,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
think now of how radio stations
are broadcasting their signals

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.510 align:middle line:90%
out to the field around them.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.030 align:middle line:84%
There are many
radio stations that

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:05.680 align:middle line:84%
can be tuned into from a
single receiver or radio plate.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:84%
That's because
they each broadcast

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
a slightly different frequency
in the radio wave range.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
If we're driving in our car
and listening to the radio,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.850 align:middle line:84%
we know we can always change
to a different station

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:84%
if we don't like what
we're listening to.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
What that means is
that we're moving

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.310 align:middle line:84%
through a sea of radio
signals, all being

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
broadcast from
different locations

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:90%
and at different frequencies.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
In this analogy, our
car represents our body,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:84%
while the radio receiver
is like our brain,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.190 align:middle line:90%
meaning it's the hardware.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.860 align:middle line:84%
The broadcasting stations
are like the centers

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of spirit awareness
that are sending out

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.080 align:middle line:84%
their ripples or
waves of information

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
within the mind of the all.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Individuated mind, like
our mind that we normally

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.420 align:middle line:84%
associate with, is the waves
themselves, or each radio

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:90%
signal being sent out.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Our mind thus functions as
a field of communication

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
between the spirit and
the brain-body system.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:84%
This communication flow
can also go both ways,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:84%
because in our case, the
body and physical world

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:84%
can also send signals and
information back to the spirit,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.450 align:middle line:84%
this makes the brain-body
system more of a receiver

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and transducer of m rather than
a generator of consciousness.

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
The mind, on the other hand,
not only transmits information--

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:84%
it can also analyze and
interpret those signals

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and respond back
to them according

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to its mental framework
or programming.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:84%
The brain receives signals from
spirit and the collective mind,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.240 align:middle line:84%
but it is our individual
mind that is processing

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:90%
and interpreting those signals.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.040 align:middle line:84%
While the brain is
the hardware, our mind

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:84%
is like the software or
the operating system.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
In order to optimize
this system,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
let's take a closer look
at how it functions.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:10%
It begins with a stimulus.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:10%
That stimulus comes in from
spirit, which we can also

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.880 align:middle line:10%
call light, love, or will.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:10%
When that stimulus
enters our field,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:10%
it is registered by our senses--

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:10%
either internal, intuitive
or external, physical senses.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.930 align:middle line:84%
This then triggers
the nervous system,

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:90%
and it creates a feeling--

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:90%
a physical body sensation.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
This sensation within
the body triggers

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:84%
our wants and desires, which
then leads to a thought.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.720 align:middle line:10%
And this thought
becomes an action,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:10%
which is then fed
back into the cycle,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.210 align:middle line:10%
creating a feedback loop.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:47.130 align:middle line:10%
This whole process is
the engine of the mind.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:10%
This is the operating system.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Through understanding
Kabbalah and the Tree of Life,

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.960 align:middle line:84%
we can better
understand this process

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and recognize it as a
cycle or feedback loop.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.990 align:middle line:84%
If we're not functioning
as we would like to,

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
we can interrupt the cycle
and reprogram our mind

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
for more positive
results, interrupting

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.640 align:middle line:84%
negative or destructive
self-sabotaging patterns

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring ourselves
to higher mind and higher will

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
in order to function
better in this vehicle.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.920 align:middle line:84%
While scientists have
attempted to connect the mind

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.420 align:middle line:84%
to the brain, the Tree of Life
reveals that the mind is truly

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.380 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:90%
It is infinite.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
This pattern is
seen at all scales.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we are
infinite beings,

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:41.350 align:middle line:84%
and we have traveled
through the cosmos already.

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So the experiences of our
higher mind are pretty vast.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Our mind brings awareness
and intelligence from spirit,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:90%
connecting us to the one mind--

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:84%
the mind of the Ein
Sof, or source, which

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.492 align:middle line:90%
is that quiet pond or sea.

00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
The quiet pond is a
metaphor for the zero point

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%
field, the ground state--

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
that body of water that
is completely still

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.460 align:middle line:90%
and as reflective as glass.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
But to really understand
this, let's dive

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.460 align:middle line:84%
a little deeper into
the quantum pond analogy

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and see what else it can reveal
about how our mind works.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Ripples or fluctuations
on the pond

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.910 align:middle line:90%
bring up a state of awareness.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.710 align:middle line:84%
What we can call our
individuated mind

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness could be
thought of as a grouping

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.940 align:middle line:90%
of waves on the ocean.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a wave, but
within that wave,

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.850 align:middle line:84%
there are fluctuations
and structure.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.180 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics, we
call this a wave packet.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
This wave packet maintains
its own structure and sense

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.490 align:middle line:84%
of identity, but it is
still part of the ocean.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
If we look at a wave packet,
imagine one big wave crest,

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and within that crest is a
modulation of other smaller

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.260 align:middle line:84%
There is an overall shape
or frequency to the crest,

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:84%
but inside that is all kinds
of other super positions

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:90%
or smaller wave packets.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And those are different
frequency levels,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:84%
all combining together
to give a complex wave.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.870 align:middle line:84%
The big shape of the wave
packet-- that big envelope--

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.110 align:middle line:90%
is more like our pure awareness.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:90%
It's the foundation.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And inside of that, all
that smaller, more complex

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:84%
wave patterning, this
is more like the states

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.290 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness and the
different levels of frequency

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.830 align:middle line:84%
that our consciousness
can attain.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So the wave packet of
the individuated mind

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:90%
is both mind and consciousness.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Within that, we have the
two states of awareness--

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.500 align:middle line:90%
the overall wave packet--

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness--
the structure

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.990 align:middle line:84%
of all those different frequency
levels coming together.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
This wave packet of
awareness travels, ,

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.860 align:middle line:84%
then through the
mind of the all,

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:84%
through that infinite sea
of the Ein Sof, the source,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:90%
the quantum field.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And it interacts
with other waves,

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:17.160 align:middle line:84%
meaning other consciousnesses
or individuated beings.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:90%
Yet we are all one.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.410 align:middle line:90%
We're all part of the sea.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.130 align:middle line:84%
This is how we're all
connected, and yet experience

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
different individuated
awarenesses.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back for a moment to
the higher mind and lower mind

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:90%
and bring this back to us.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Gaining awareness of
these two levels of mind

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.320 align:middle line:84%
and how they
function in our lives

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is a key to operating this
vehicle of the mind for a more

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:90%
conscious level.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
We can think of the higher
mind as the higher frequency

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
aspects of the wave
and the lower mind

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:84%
as the lower frequency aspects
within that wave packet.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, the
lower frequencies

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.310 align:middle line:84%
can seem to actually
dominate in terms

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.530 align:middle line:90%
of our waking consciousness.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.810 align:middle line:84%
These lower frequencies
are influenced

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:84%
more by our experiences
in the world,

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.090 align:middle line:84%
through our education,
indoctrinations,

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.770 align:middle line:84%
emotional attachments,
and personality.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:84%
But as we tune into
the higher frequencies

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:84%
we can access the more
subtle yet potent details

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.620 align:middle line:84%
and fine structure
of that wave packet.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.920 align:middle line:84%
The levels of the mind all
deal with our sense of self

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:90%
in relation to everything else.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, what we see on
the Tree of Life--

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.140 align:middle line:84%
there are three spheres
that relate to the higher

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.110 align:middle line:84%
mind and three
spheres of operating

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:90%
in relation to the lower mind.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's break this
down even further

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
and see what those
interactions of each

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.560 align:middle line:84%
of these spheres on the Tree
of Life really reveal to us.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.530 align:middle line:10%
Our lower mind
corresponds to the triad

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.500 align:middle line:10%
of Yesod, Hod, and Netsah.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.170 align:middle line:10%
Yesod, which means foundation,
is our subconscious.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.599 align:middle line:10%
It's influenced by our
habits and unresolved issues

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.060 align:middle line:10%
of the past that
have been buried.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Hod, on the other
hand, means glory.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:10%
It is our rational mind
which discerns and judges.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:10%
It reasons.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:10%
Netsah, which
translates as victory,

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:10%
relates to emotion,
intuition, and creativity.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.980 align:middle line:84%
All of these aspects
here just mentioned

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:84%
on this part of the tree help
to develop our personality.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%
They are our filters--

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:90%
our perceptions.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The higher mind,
on the other hand,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to
that middle triad.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And these spheres are
Tif'Eret, Gevurah, and Hesed.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:84%
Tif'Eret means beauty, and
this would be connection

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:90%
to our higher self--

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.450 align:middle line:84%
kindness, connection
to the heart,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.960 align:middle line:84%
a sense of beauty in all
things, love for ourselves.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.570 align:middle line:84%
This is our higher self from
an inner plane connection.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Gevurah, which means
severity, would be more

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.180 align:middle line:84%
the higher functions
of discernment

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
and really being strong in
our sense of empowerment

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:90%
and knowing our power.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Gevurah is like having
the courage to express

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
and also creating that proper
boundary and a way of relating

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%
to others.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Hesed, on the other
hand, is about mercy,

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and this would be more of
the higher faculties of love

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:84%
for all, greater
capacity for compassion,

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:31.450 align:middle line:84%
altruism, service-oriented
leadership.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:84%
When this triad of the higher
mind is really working well,

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
it is an embodiment of
servant leadership--

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:84%
someone who's truly
devoted to a higher

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:84%
cause, and inspiring and
uniting others in that mission.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Through the Tree
of Life, we can see

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
how our higher mind and
our lower mind operate.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And working with the Tree
of Life and Kabbalah,

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:58.210 align:middle line:84%
we can reprogram
our mind to optimize

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.150 align:middle line:84%
the functioning of this
vehicle and each sphere

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:84%
that relates to the
different aspects of mind.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.080 align:middle line:84%
This truly awakens
us to our higher will

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and helps us to
follow our spirit

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and where it desires us to go.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.250 align:middle line:84%
How do we rewire and
attune this system?

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:84%
The process to rewire
and strengthen our system

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:84%
can be compared to the analogy
of tuning into different radio

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.480 align:middle line:90%
stations.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:84%
If we want to listen
to classical music,

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.530 align:middle line:84%
we're going to charge
the appropriate station

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:90%
on the radio dial.

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.530 align:middle line:84%
But if we want to
listen to rock music,

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
we need to turn to
a different station.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
If we're looking for
traffic or weather,

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.780 align:middle line:84%
we might switch
to an AM frequency

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:90%
instead of the FM dial.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:84%
The decision to listen to a
certain station is a choice.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
We use our intention to
shift our system to tune

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:90%
in to that desired frequency.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:84%
So intention here
is truly the key

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:84%
to bridging from
our daily awareness

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:90%
to our higher consciousness.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.310 align:middle line:84%
This is what really helps us
tune into the desired radio

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:90%
station of the mind.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Setting intention is
the thought process,

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
and we act according to our
own will to turn the dial,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So within this radio analogy,
the signals of the mine field

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
are like the
specific frequencies

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
within the
electromagnetic spectrum--

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.410 align:middle line:84%
a form of vibrational energy
in the radio wave range.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:84%
They exist virtually everywhere,
and we are constantly

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.890 align:middle line:84%
receiving these signals
even if we're not

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:90%
tuned in and aware of them.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Altogether, we form a complex
and interconnected wholeness,

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
bridging from the densest
levels of physicality

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.050 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the
infinite expanse

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:90%
of universal consciousness.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
We are one whole, yet
we often believe or act

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:84%
as if we're just a
separate part struggling

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.690 align:middle line:90%
to survive in a harsh world

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:84%
The biggest rifts we must bridge
are the places in our system

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that cause us to perceive
ourselves and others as

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:90%
separate.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps these perceptions
of separation--

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe there are consequences
of complementarity

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.190 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to observe
and distinguish experiences

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:22.050 align:middle line:90%
in the physical life.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But when those
perceived separations

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:29.550 align:middle line:84%
are mistaken as real, the
rifts in our mind expand.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:84%
These misperceptions
are the result

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.140 align:middle line:84%
of faulty programming
in the mind

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and hardwiring in the brain.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
We see, for example, how
open children and babies are.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:45.230 align:middle line:10%
They seem to have no sense
of separation or limitation.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But then, by around
the age of six,

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
we start coming into
the age of reasoning.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And through indoctrination
and social filters,

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:90%
the rift begins to expand.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:84%
In our effort now to bridge
back to our sense of wholeness

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.620 align:middle line:84%
and connection to
the infinite self,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.380 align:middle line:84%
we must address our
current framework,

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
which often blocks us from
perceiving our connection

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:90%
to the greater cosmos.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.660 align:middle line:84%
To do this, we begin
with our intention.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.650 align:middle line:84%
Intention initiates
the choice to build

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
the bridge between
our awareness and

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.070 align:middle line:90%
the universal consciousness.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Intention alone,
however, is not enough.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
For change to take place,
we need to take action.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Conscious change requires us
to have the knowledge of what

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:84%
actions to take that
will successfully

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:90%
lead to our desired change.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:84%
We also need the commitment
to take the necessary steps

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and retrain our system
for more expanded states

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.890 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The blocks within
the system are due

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
to the inner and
outer perceptions.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And our perceptions
are influenced

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:02.200 align:middle line:84%
both by our mental and
physical programming.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:84%
In order to better understand
how our perceptions work

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.430 align:middle line:84%
and how to rewire
our system, let's

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
take a look at how the
nervous system receives

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:84%
signals and processes and
prioritizes that information.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Our nervous system's
spine and primitive brain

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.080 align:middle line:84%
are some of the earliest
systems to begin development

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.660 align:middle line:84%
within the embryo,
and they are also

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.600 align:middle line:84%
the last to be
completed after birth.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.790 align:middle line:84%
The development
of our neocortex,

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.410 align:middle line:84%
our most human
part of the brain,

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:90%
continues into early adulthood.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And throughout our life,
we have the ability

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.620 align:middle line:84%
to re-mold and re-pattern
our brains' wiring.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Our brain itself
is an intricately

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:50.920 align:middle line:84%
arranged system of neurons and
glial cells and biochemicals.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
The majority of the
neurons within the brain

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.610 align:middle line:84%
are actually formed
before birth.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And as the brain
develops in utero,

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
it forms three primary systems,
each building one on top

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.030 align:middle line:90%
of the other.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Evolution has
optimized this process

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
for higher levels
of functioning.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And these systems build
from the bottom up

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and then move from
the back to the front.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.900 align:middle line:84%
The first three systems are the
old brain, the limbic system,

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:90%
and the neocortex.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.250 align:middle line:90%
What are these three systems?

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start
with the old brain.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:31.070 align:middle line:84%
The old brain starts developing
three weeks after conception,

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and it primarily develops
during the second trimester

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.720 align:middle line:84%
of pregnancy, continuing,
though, through age 1

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.220 align:middle line:90%
after birth.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.440 align:middle line:10%
The structures
within the old brain

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:10%
include the hindbrain, which
is composed of the brain

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:10%
stem, the pons, the medulla
oblongata, and the cerebellum,

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:10%
as well as the
midbrain, which is

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.570 align:middle line:10%
related to our sense
of touch and balance.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.780 align:middle line:10%
The next system building off of
the foundation of the old brain

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:10%
is the limbic system,
which primarily develops

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:10%
as toddlers up to the age of 5.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:10%
This is the functioning
of our reward centers--

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.640 align:middle line:10%
the fight or flight
response as well.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:10%
The structures within
the limbic system

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.030 align:middle line:10%
include the thalamus, the
hypothalamus, the hippocampus,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:10%
the amygdala, and
the basal ganglia.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.560 align:middle line:10%
The limbic system relates mostly
to our emotions, our long term

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:10%
memory, spatial
mapping, and it's also

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.370 align:middle line:10%
related to our sense
of hearing and smell.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:34.450 align:middle line:84%
As we move higher, then,
into the neocortex, this area

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
is primarily developed
during childhood,

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.090 align:middle line:84%
with the right hemisphere
dominating development

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.620 align:middle line:84%
between the ages of 4 to 7
years old, and then synthesizing

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:48.460 align:middle line:84%
the right and left hemispheres
from the age of 7 to 11 years

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:84%
The neocortex is fully developed
by around the age 15 years old.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.510 align:middle line:84%
The primary structures
within the neocortex

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:02.230 align:middle line:84%
are the left and right
hemispheres of the cerebrum.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.710 align:middle line:84%
These include the frontal,
temporal, parietal,

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.760 align:middle line:90%
and occipital lobes.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.210 align:middle line:84%
This area of the brain
is related to our sense

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.330 align:middle line:90%
of vision and hearing.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.180 align:middle line:84%
It relates to our imagination
memory, attention,

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:21.160 align:middle line:84%
language capacities, perceptual
awareness, spatial reasoning,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.830 align:middle line:90%
and motor commands.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:90%
After birth, the fourth system--

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.070 align:middle line:84%
the prefrontal cortex
at the very forehead--

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.620 align:middle line:90%
begins to rapidly develop.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the part of the brain
that makes us the most human.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:84%
It is our executive
control center,

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and it is responsible
for decision

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.620 align:middle line:84%
making, planning-- it
helps form our personality

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.450 align:middle line:90%
and our expression.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
This prefrontal cortex
is what orchestrates

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:84%
the leadership over the other
three systems of the brain--

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:84%
at least, that's
what's intended.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
This foremost part of
the brain is actually

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
the last to develop
after birth, and it

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.930 align:middle line:84%
continues developing all
the way up to about age 25.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Beyond these four
brain systems, science

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:84%
is now also beginning
to realize that we

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:84%
have two other very
important systems that

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.010 align:middle line:84%
are part of the nervous
system and the brain.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And these two parts include
the heart and the gut.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:84%
The heart influences
the functions

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:84%
of the brain in
significant ways,

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.350 align:middle line:84%
maintaining a two-way
communication between the heart

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and the brain.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is constantly
sending signals to the brain.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.940 align:middle line:84%
It communicates through
the nerve cells,

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.250 align:middle line:84%
through hormones,
through pressure waves,

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and through the heart's
massive electromagnetic field.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:43.340 align:middle line:84%
As the rhythms of the
heart become more coherent,

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.670 align:middle line:84%
we experience shifts in
our perception, increased

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:84%
mental clarity, and heightened
intuitive awareness.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:10%
The deepest part of
this system is the gut,

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:10%
and it also contains over
100 million nerve cells,

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:04.700 align:middle line:10%
forming what scientists now
call an enteric nervous system.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.060 align:middle line:84%
An imbalance in the gut has
been connected to things

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.580 align:middle line:84%
like anxiety and
depression, affecting

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.500 align:middle line:84%
our mood, our cognition,
and our behaviors.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that relaxation
techniques such as meditation

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and yoga help to relieve
gut-related imbalances.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
It is clear that our
brain-body system

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is more than just
the sum of its parts.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:34.130 align:middle line:84%
It is operating as a complex
and interconnected system.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
As we see from this journey
through the fetal development,

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.470 align:middle line:84%
not only does the brain
develop from the bottom up,

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.010 align:middle line:84%
but MRI studies have also
shown that it then moves

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:44.855 align:middle line:90%
from the back to the front.

00:28:44.855 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But why is this important
for us to understand?

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have to know
how the brain was

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.110 align:middle line:84%
built in order to work our
way back to the foundations.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We tend to have more
conscious awareness

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.020 align:middle line:84%
of the prefrontal cortex
and the neocortex,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.180 align:middle line:84%
while the deeper brain
and the limbic system

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:84%
are usually operating
subconsciously or

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
As we embark on
rewiring our brain,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.670 align:middle line:84%
we begin working our
way from the front

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:84%
backwards and then
down, starting

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
where we can create
this intention

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:84%
from a conscious level, and
then working our way back

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:25.620 align:middle line:84%
to the deeper
foundations of the brain.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And while we may be able to
compare parts of the brain

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.970 align:middle line:84%
to different
developmental stages,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:33.300 align:middle line:90%
this is a very simplified model.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.850 align:middle line:84%
The brain itself is not
composed of separate parts,

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.230 align:middle line:84%
but it functions in
a very connected way.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:45.210 align:middle line:84%
The average neuron has anywhere
between 1,000 to 10,000

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:90%
synaptic connections.

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And beyond this, there are
biochemical communications

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.170 align:middle line:84%
between the brain and
the rest of the body

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
through neuropeptides
and hormones

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.910 align:middle line:90%
and the endocrine glands.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.330 align:middle line:84%
This inter-system
connectivity provides us

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:04.920 align:middle line:84%
the framework to enhance the
connectivity of the brain.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.440 align:middle line:84%
To bring our waking
consciousness

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
into a more transcendent
state of awareness,

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.210 align:middle line:84%
we must become more conscious
of the whole brain function.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.600 align:middle line:84%
In an ideal situation,
if everything goes well

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:84%
during the brain's development,
and if everything is

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.080 align:middle line:90%
operating in perfect harmony--

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:84%
we have built those
proper connections

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.370 align:middle line:90%
through our growth--

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:29.040 align:middle line:84%
we should be almost
like super humans

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:90%
by the time we're in our 20s.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:90%
So what went wrong?

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, typically, there are
breakdowns that happen.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:84%
We experience
improper programming

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:90%
during the developmental stages.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.300 align:middle line:84%
There's emotional and mental
attachments that can come in.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And while the evolutionary
pattern guided our brain

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:49.710 align:middle line:84%
development from the
bottom up, it often

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.610 align:middle line:84%
did so in a chaotic
and stochastic way.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:84%
We experienced trauma,
and faulty inputs,

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:59.470 align:middle line:84%
leading to bad habits,
and as a result,

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
the bridges between
the different systems

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.170 align:middle line:90%
are incomplete.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:06.660 align:middle line:84%
There's connections that
are missing and damaged

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:90%
through this process.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, if all really does
go well, the brain systems

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.640 align:middle line:84%
build in succession through
the developmental stages

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.740 align:middle line:84%
with the proper
connections forming

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.810 align:middle line:90%
at each phase of development.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Fully integrating
these brain systems

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:84%
gives us huge potential
to learn, adapt,

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.270 align:middle line:90%
and go beyond limitations.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:31.650 align:middle line:84%
But when those communications
and proper linking break down,

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.460 align:middle line:90%
we become our own worst enemy.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%
We fall into
self-sabotage patterns.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:84%
We get caught up in
limited thinking,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and we have loads of
emotional baggage.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And our task is now to
consciously repair the system

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.710 align:middle line:84%
so that we can access all
of our potential and optimal

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:90%
functioning.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.270 align:middle line:84%
The Tree of Life
provides the map

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:01.470 align:middle line:84%
showing us the pattern and how
to bring this intricate system

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.970 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We can relate these levels of
development to the pathways

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.600 align:middle line:84%
on the Tree of Life and
retrace our way back

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.120 align:middle line:84%
through the
evolutionary process,

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.360 align:middle line:84%
building a more conscious
and connected system

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.390 align:middle line:84%
that allows for optimal
functioning and expanded

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.980 align:middle line:90%
states of consciousness.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So are we doomed to
our previous wiring

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.440 align:middle line:90%
and all the faulty programming?

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, no.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
neuroplasticity of the brain,

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.850 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability to
rewire and strengthen

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.150 align:middle line:84%
these faulty connections,
and we can do this

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:40.350 align:middle line:84%
through our spiritual practice,
through our lifestyle choices,

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and through a
willingness to let go

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.830 align:middle line:90%
of our emotional attachments.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.220 align:middle line:84%
This rewiring
process is only going

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to happen through us
making the right choices

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.440 align:middle line:90%
and taking the right actions.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.260 align:middle line:84%
And for this, our attitude
and our ways of thinking

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.460 align:middle line:84%
are 95% of the battle of what
determines our ability to truly

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:90%
rewire the brain-body system.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:04.920 align:middle line:90%
So how do we start this process?

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first step to
start reprogramming the brain

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.470 align:middle line:84%
is to bring our sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.030 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.730 align:middle line:84%
If we're in overdrive
all the time,

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:22.030 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to allow
any rewiring to happen.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to start first
by relaxing the body,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.880 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the breath,
relaxing the muscles,

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.740 align:middle line:84%
emptying your mind
of any thoughts.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.880 align:middle line:84%
One exercise to work with is
to practice tuning your radio

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.350 align:middle line:84%
dial into connecting to the
universal consciousness.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:84%
We do this by tuning to the zero
point field, or the quiet pond.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.270 align:middle line:84%
This can be done with
a simple visualization

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
to bring your mind
into the state.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So to begin, close your eyes
and take a few deep breaths,

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:84%
imagining the ocean, the
universal sea of consciousness.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:05.900 align:middle line:90%
See the waves.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Visualize and sense and
begin to imagine yourself

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:16.560 align:middle line:84%
as a part of these waves,
and then sink deeper

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.389 align:middle line:90%
into the ocean.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:24.489 align:middle line:84%
Sink below the waves, becoming
a part of the ocean depth.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.190 align:middle line:84%
The deeper you sink
into the ocean,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:31.489 align:middle line:84%
also bring the ocean
into stillness.

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Begin to connect
to the background

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.035 align:middle line:90%
of stillness within the ocean.

00:34:36.035 --> 00:34:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.500 align:middle line:84%
As we connect into
that stillness,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.690 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to relax, to
surrender, and to normalize

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:90%
to ground state.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Practicing meditation every
day by bringing the mind

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.120 align:middle line:84%
into that state of
stillness is a powerful tool
