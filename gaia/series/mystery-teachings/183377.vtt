00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:10%
How can we best use our
senses to rewire our brain

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.980 align:middle line:10%
for optimal functioning?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:10%
To answer that, we must
first understand how

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:10%
our senses and brain connect.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
We can think of the
neurological system as a tree.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:84%
The brain is like the
upper part of the tree.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.500 align:middle line:10%
And the neural networks between
the different brain regions

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.040 align:middle line:10%
are like the branches,
leaves, and fruits;

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:10%
while the brain stem and
spinal cord form the trunk;

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:10%
and the nerve extensions
traveling throughout the body

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:10%
are the network of roots;
and at the end of these roots

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:10%
are the sensory receptors.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is from these
receptors that we

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350 align:middle line:84%
draw in energy and
nutrients to fuel

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:90%
the growth of the whole tree.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Thus, how we use
our senses is key.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.220 align:middle line:84%
Stimulating our senses
in the proper way

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.790 align:middle line:90%
is like watering the roots.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
We want to provide the
right sensory input

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:90%
for a strong and healthy tree.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
We may also need to do
some work to prune away

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:90%
the unhealthy branches.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And by intentionally
stimulating our senses,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.540 align:middle line:84%
we can rewire our brain,
and in the process,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
prune away old patterns
that aren't serving us.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.020 align:middle line:84%
We should view our
senses as more than just

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:84%
passive receptors of
the world around us.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Our senses feed into our
brain and body system,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and if we are proactive, we can
intentionally stimulate them

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:90%
in a harmonious way.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.229 align:middle line:84%
Just like we should be mindful
of eating a healthy diet that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.120 align:middle line:84%
supports us, we should also be
mindful of the sensory stimuli

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that we feed our
nervous system with.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
This is about creating a
lifestyle that brings us

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.830 align:middle line:90%
into a whole brain state.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
The stimuli we encounter out in
the world can be very chaotic,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and we don't proactively
engage our senses

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
in more coherent
ways, our system

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
gets thrown out of
balance very easily.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But when we do use
our senses every day

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
to create greater coherence
and raise our vibration,

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
we can re-establish that
balance that we desire.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Actively engaging our senses
to create harmony within

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.350 align:middle line:90%
is part of the alchemy of life.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So which senses
should we focus on?

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, all of our
senses are important,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:84%
they each stimulate different
regions within the brain,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.330 align:middle line:84%
yet there is one sensory
organ that stands out.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Stimulating this organ
can be especially

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
effective at helping us to
rewire our neural pathways

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and bring us into a
state of transcendence.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
It is the first sensory organ
to actually develop in utero,

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and it functions 24/7
throughout most of our lives.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Can you guess what it is?

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:90%
It's the ear.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The ear is a powerhouse
that influences us

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:90%
on so many levels.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Well there's some
fascinating research

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
into the fundamental
connections between our ear,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
the rest of our brain, and body.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.970 align:middle line:10%
French scientist Alfred
Tomatis discovered

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.590 align:middle line:10%
that the ear has three
times more nerve connections

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.480 align:middle line:10%
to the brain than the
eyes do, and it directly

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:10%
connects to every
organ in the body.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.480 align:middle line:84%
The energy received
through our ears

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:84%
feeds into all of our
organs, charging them up

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.720 align:middle line:90%
like a generator.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The ear also has the greatest
capacity for expansion.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Our eyes only perceive
one octave range

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.880 align:middle line:84%
within the visible
spectrum of light,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
but the human ear is 10
times more sensitive.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:10%
Our ears are capable
of perceiving

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.040 align:middle line:10%
a 10-octave range,
from as low as 16 hertz

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:10%
to as high as 20,000 hertz.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
We may be capable of hearing
this wide range of sounds,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean we
are conscious of perceiving

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:90%
all of them.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.840 align:middle line:84%
It is up to us to
train ourselves

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
to hear the subtleties
and the outer ranges

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
of that auditory
spectrum, and one way

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
to do this is to expose
ourselves to new sounds.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:84%
How else does the ear help
shape our experience of reality?

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Well we tend to rely a
lot on our sense of sight

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:90%
to navigate our environment.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But consider the
landscape of sound.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Our ears build a framework
of our reality through sound.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Think of how easy
it is to recognize

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
the characteristic sounds
of physical phenomenon.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.200 align:middle line:84%
The boom of a lightning
strike, the roar of a fire,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
the blowing of the
wind, the soothing sound

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.930 align:middle line:90%
of running water.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.900 align:middle line:84%
All of this can be
identified through the ears

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.770 align:middle line:84%
alone without any
visual stimulus.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And while our eyes may
rest, the ears never sleep.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
They are active before
we are even born,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and they stay active
while we're sleeping.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Our ears are constantly
transmitting energy

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.490 align:middle line:84%
into our organs and
brain, and so they

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
function like a
24/7 transformer,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:84%
continuously
transmitting information

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to charge the body
and the brain.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Another fascinating
aspect of the ears

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.360 align:middle line:84%
is how the shape
of the outer ear

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.060 align:middle line:84%
resembles the inverted
fetus within the womb.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:90%
Well what can we make of that?

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:10%
Within the Daoist and
traditional Chinese medicine

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:10%
traditions, the ear is
seen as the microcosm

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.220 align:middle line:10%
to the macrocosm of our body.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
The ear provides a
map to the whole body,

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.495 align:middle line:84%
with connections to each
of the body's systems.

00:06:51.495 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
How else can we work with
the powerhouse of our ears

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.390 align:middle line:90%
to rewire our brain?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's start by looking at
how the ear and our ability

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
to perceive sound plays out in
the development of the brain.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:84%
There was a time
in human evolution

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:84%
when the brain rapidly
tripled in size,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and this period of
growth coincided

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.220 align:middle line:84%
with the development of the
language centers of the brain.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Now while it's difficult
to directly link

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
language development
to this rapid growth,

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:84%
scientists agree that language
played an important role.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Another contributing
aspect was the development

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:84%
of more complex
social interactions.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle famously
described humans

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
as the most social
animal on the planet,

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.540 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to process
social interactions, language,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:84%
and sound relies
on a direct circuit

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that runs between
the temporal lobes

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:90%
and the prefrontal cortex.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The temporal lobes are found at
the sides of the brain directly

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
ears, and the circuit

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
played an important
role in our evolution,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.010 align:middle line:84%
and it continues to play a
critical role in our brain

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:90%
development throughout our life.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Remember how the ear
is the first organ

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:90%
to function within the fetus.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Babies in the womb hear their
mother's voice as she speaks.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:84%
They also hear the muted
sounds and voices and music

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:90%
from the outer environment.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:84%
These stimuli are wiring the
brain, creating neural patterns

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.309 align:middle line:90%
before the baby is even born.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Also, the more
sounds and language

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that we are exposed to, the
more neural wiring we develop.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And studies show
that babies exposed

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
to multiple languages quickly
develop more advanced wiring

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.986 align:middle line:90%
and language capacity.

00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Now how do the temporal
lobes process these stimuli?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Well like the prefrontal
cortex, the temporals

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
are found in both the
right and left hemispheres.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
The right temporal processes
non-verbal communication

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
through tone, pitch,
volume, and emotional tenor;

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:84%
while the left temporal
analyzes syntax, word choice,

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.320 align:middle line:90%
and meaning.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
The left temporal
compares this input

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.360 align:middle line:84%
to what it already
knows to formulate

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:84%
an appropriate response, and
the left side then also pays

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:90%
attention to the details.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Then it can be related
to more of our IQ.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the right temporal is
scanning for the big picture,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and it deals with
relationships, thus linking more

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:90%
to our EQ or emotional quotient.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.100 align:middle line:84%
If we want healthy
social interactions,

00:09:54.100 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:84%
we need to be both IQ and EQ
to be active and in balance.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
In the Pythagorean
Mystery School,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
they talked about the
sounds of the universe

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:90%
or the music of the spheres.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
They were referring to the
movement of the planets,

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:84%
the sun, and the moon
all in their orbits,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and how their relative
placement must

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.780 align:middle line:84%
be according to musical
proportions and harmony.

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Some say it was a purely
mathematical concept, not

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.470 align:middle line:84%
a literal music,
but legend has it

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that Pythagoras could actually
hear the music of the spheres.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But he apparently also
told the Egyptian priests

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:84%
that the god of wisdom, Thoth,
had given him the ability

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:48.250 align:middle line:90%
to hear the musica universalis.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
He believed that certain people
of the right bloodline who

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.090 align:middle line:84%
had been initiated
at the higher levels

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.030 align:middle line:84%
could also enter into
the inner temples

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
where they, too,
could hear this music.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
What's remarkable is that
with today's technology,

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:84%
we've been able to verify
that this music is not just

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:84%
an abstract concept, it
is a physical phenomenon.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:84%
As the planets move
in their orbits,

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:84%
they create waves of
electromagnetic energy,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
small gravitational ripples,
and plasma field vibrations.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:10%
NASA's even recorded
these vibrations

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:10%
and transformed them into a
format that our ears can hear.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And through these
recordings, we can

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
listen to the unique sounds
that each planet makes,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.500 align:middle line:84%
as well as the symphony
of our solar system.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.250 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing thing to hear.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:84%
If we come back to the
microcosm, on a smaller scale,

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
every organ in our body creates
a signature sound pattern

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
through its own
movements and operations.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Schematic studies have measured
these signature patterns

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.240 align:middle line:84%
produced by the body, and
through this research,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
we can determine
the healthy range

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.200 align:middle line:90%
of frequencies for each organ.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And when there's
illness in the body,

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
there's disharmony
in the frequencies.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
The cymatic therapies have
been used to help bring

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:90%
the body back into harmony.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:84%
They first determine
the vibrational input

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
needed to restore
harmony, and then

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
they introduce the
appropriate sound patterns

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
to entrain that part of
the body back to health.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Even our own voice can
be a powerful instrument

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:90%
for stimulating the brain.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Did you know that there are
direct channels connecting

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:90%
the throat to the inner ear?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
When we speak, sing, or tone, we
stimulate ourselves internally.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
This sound travels directly
to the ears from the throat.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Rather than just hearing
it from the outside,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we hear our own voice
from the inside.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Singing, chanting,
and toning out loud

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:84%
also activates
the neural circuit

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.260 align:middle line:84%
between the temporal lobes
and the prefrontal cortex.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
It can help us
feel good, and also

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:84%
bring us into altered
states of consciousness.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
This is why so many ancient
spiritual practices incorporate

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
techniques like
mantra meditations,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:84%
chanting, toning, singing hymns,
saying prayers, and reciting

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:90%
rituals out loud.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
They often combine sound
and musical entrainment

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.280 align:middle line:84%
with somatic breath work
to induce shamanic journeys

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.560 align:middle line:84%
All of these methods
harness the power of sound

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.940 align:middle line:84%
to create greater
harmony within the body.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:13.010 align:middle line:84%
How can we use this knowledge
to improve our lives?

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine ourselves
as a set of vibrations.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.720 align:middle line:84%
We influence and are influenced
by all the vibrations

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.130 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Using specific methods,
we can ATTUNE ourselves

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.070 align:middle line:90%
to create greater harmony.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And if we start
going out of tune,

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
we can make small,
daily adjustments

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to bring ourselves
back into balance.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But if we let it
go for too long,

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
moving further and
further out of tune,

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
this is when things
start to break down.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Disease sets in when
disharmony is present.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Recall the analogy of our brain
and body system as a tree.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
We support our overall health
by nourishing the roots

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.670 align:middle line:90%
and stimulating the senses.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
By providing
harmonizing inputs, we

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.540 align:middle line:84%
can strengthen the vitality
and overall well-being

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.280 align:middle line:90%
of our whole system.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.120 align:middle line:84%
We can use any of our
senses as an input,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.060 align:middle line:84%
but with its ability
to shape matter,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
sound has a very
broad-reaching effect on us.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
By being more aware
of this effect,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:84%
we can be mindful of the sounds
that we expose ourselves to.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can't control all
the sounds in our environment,

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
but we can do our best
to re-harmonize ourselves

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Cymatics, sound healing,
and music therapy

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:84%
are great tools to help
keep our body in balance.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle line:84%
When we also recognize
our senses as tools

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.040 align:middle line:84%
to rewire and
harmonize our brain,

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
we might want to incorporate
these tools as part

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.540 align:middle line:90%
of our regular practice.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:84%
These are simple
things that we can

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
do to maintain greater
balance and harmony within.

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
traveling through city streets

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
or on airplanes, sounds
can be more chaotic.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.750 align:middle line:84%
One thing we can do
is wear headphones

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and listen to more
harmonizing frequencies

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:90%
during our transit time.

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
proper inputs needed

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.150 align:middle line:84%
to create that harmony within
the brain and our whole system?

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.780 align:middle line:84%
One really effective
method is to use

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
specific music that creates a
synchronized brainwave state.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Certain music can create
a wave of activity

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
in the brain that
sweeps between the left

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
and the right hemispheres
as well as front to back,

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and this movement brings us into
a coherent, whole brain state.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:84%
When in a coherent state, the
whole system functions better.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So what types of
music to we use?

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
Well one attempt at
answering that scientifically

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.140 align:middle line:84%
was research
conducted in the 1990s

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:05.050 align:middle line:84%
by UC Irvine physicist Gordon
Shaw and psychologist Frances

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Rauscher.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
They studied the positive impact
that complex harmonic music

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:90%
can have on cognition.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.329 align:middle line:10%
Basically, in this
study, students

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:21.010 align:middle line:10%
were found to perform better
on an IQ and spatial reasoning

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:26.349 align:middle line:10%
test while they were listening
to Mozart versus when they were

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.780 align:middle line:10%
taking that test in silence.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.320 align:middle line:84%
So they called this
the Mozart effect.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:84%
Shaw concluded that
certain complex music

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:84%
stimulates the higher
functions of the brain

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and impacts our ability
to learn and function.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.250 align:middle line:10%
This role of music on
learning and cognition

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:10%
has led to the development of
what's called designer music.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It includes compositions that
follow harmonic patterns using

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:58.630 align:middle line:84%
certain higher keys and a
variety of rhythms and tempos.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
This designer music is
based on the Mozart effect,

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's specifically
geared towards bringing

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
us to peak performance during
times of concentration.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.880 align:middle line:84%
When properly tuned
and sequenced,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:84%
musical compositions
are also being combined

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.950 align:middle line:90%
with brainwave entrainment.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:84%
What results is something
we call meta music.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Meta means "more than."

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So meta music is
created specifically

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate brainwave
synchronization

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.860 align:middle line:84%
at certain desired
frequency levels.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Through this, we can
tailor harmonic sounds,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:84%
combine them with
brainwave entrainment

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
in order to access different
regions of the brain.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
This can aid our effort to build
those bridges that harmonize

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:51.430 align:middle line:84%
and unite the different
parts of the brain.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:10%
They can also be
designed to elicit

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:10%
expanded states of awareness.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.210 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on which
brainwave frequency patterns

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.090 align:middle line:90%
are embedded into the music.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:10%
The field of designing
such audio tools that

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:10%
use binaural beats and
meta music was first

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:10%
pioneered starting in the 1950s
by Bob Monroe and the Monroe

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:10%
Institute.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.730 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Recall from earlier that one way
to create new neural networks

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is by challenging our brain
with new inputs and tasks,

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:33.940 align:middle line:84%
such as exposing
ourselves to new sounds.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Such as listening to sitar
music and the Indian ragas,

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.360 align:middle line:84%
they were already
mentioned as one option.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
We can also use variations
from standard musical tuning.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:51.390 align:middle line:84%
Examples include what we
call 432-hertz turning,

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.730 align:middle line:84%
there's also something
called Pythagorean tuning,

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and there's the Solfeggio
frequency tuning.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Now here, we're talking
about the frequency

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
of the music itself beyond
the brainwave states.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:07.750 align:middle line:10%
Most music in the
West is now tuned

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.560 align:middle line:10%
to the note A is 440 hertz.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.680 align:middle line:84%
This is what we are
used to listening to,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:84%
and that our brains
are conditioned into.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.400 align:middle line:84%
But many sound healers
today are advocating

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:90%
for 432 hertz tuning.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.100 align:middle line:84%
They claim that it is
a pure frequency that

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
is fundamental to the sacred
geometry and the mathematics

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:32.690 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.650 align:middle line:84%
While I'm not a
musician, I've long

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:39.340 align:middle line:84%
been interested in the
potential of sound and music

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.270 align:middle line:84%
to be used for healing
purposes, so naturally, I

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:84%
wanted to know more about
why they make this claim.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:84%
What's so special
about 432 hertz?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
How does it relate to basic
sacred geometry and mathematics

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.820 align:middle line:90%
of the universe?

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
To get beyond a
superficial answer,

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.430 align:middle line:84%
it really required some digging
into the history of music.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.180 align:middle line:84%
In the late 17th century
France, under the rule

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:17.260 align:middle line:84%
of the great King Louis XIV,
art in all its forms flourished.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.130 align:middle line:90%
King Louis XIV was a visionary.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.570 align:middle line:84%
He was a Mystery
School initiate,

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.050 align:middle line:84%
and the creator of
the spectacular Palace

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:90%
of Versailles.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:10%
There are many great musicians
who graced the royal court.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.600 align:middle line:84%
However, at the time
there was no agreed

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
upon standard for tuning
their musical instruments.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:84%
It seemed the different
musicians adopted

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.710 align:middle line:90%
different tuning methods.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Around 1680, a physicist
and mathematician

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:84%
named Joseph Sauveur
was brought in

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.390 align:middle line:84%
to teach math and
astronomy to the princes

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:90%
and pages of the royal court.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
In 1689, he also became the
science and math teacher

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:84%
to the king's nephew,
the Duke of Chartres.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.880 align:middle line:84%
He was then joined by the
music teacher, Etienne Loulie,

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
who instructed the duke and
the elements of music theory.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
These two teachers
joined forces to show

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:23.150 align:middle line:84%
how mathematics and music
theory were interrelated.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Together, they
worked for many years

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.100 align:middle line:84%
on the science of
sound, which came

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.280 align:middle line:84%
to be known later as
acoustics, a word that

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:90%
means "able to hear."

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.520 align:middle line:90%
Now what did they come up with?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.670 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
correlate musical pitch

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.560 align:middle line:84%
with the frequency of sound
based on how many wavelengths

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:47.440 align:middle line:90%
fit on a vibrating string.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They also studied what
frequencies harmonized

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:84%
with each other,
as well as tuning

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and working with other
musical instruments

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.290 align:middle line:90%
and ranges of voices.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And from this research,
Sauveur developed a measure

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:90%
of intervals within the octave.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The octave is a
natural phenomenon that

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.410 align:middle line:90%
forms the basis of all music.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:16.370 align:middle line:84%
It is based on doubling
the frequency of sounds

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.340 align:middle line:90%
as we go up each octave higher.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Within one octave in
our Western scale,

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.190 align:middle line:84%
traditionally we have
seven major nodes.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:32.060 align:middle line:84%
Today, we know of these as
do re mi fa so la ti do.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
The second do is twice
the frequency value

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:41.000 align:middle line:84%
as the first do, and it
starts the next octave.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:84%
There are also
half-notes based on

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.010 align:middle line:84%
fitting only
half-wavelengths on a string,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
and this results in 12
subnotes in an octave.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:10%
In Sauveur's system, he
assigned the note of middle C,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.110 align:middle line:10%
which is the first node
on a keyboard sequence,

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.190 align:middle line:10%
to be 256 hertz.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:10%
This would then
make the note of A,

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.310 align:middle line:10%
which is the sixth whole note
or white key on the keyboard,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:15.300 align:middle line:10%
to be about 430.5 hertz.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:10%
And the reason for C
equals 256 hertz is again

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.970 align:middle line:10%
based on the octave and
mathematical harmonics.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:29.660 align:middle line:84%
256 is perfectly divisible
by 8, and it is exactly

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:90%
five octaves above eight hertz.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
The Octaves of C thus
remain a whole number

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.900 align:middle line:84%
in hertz, all the way
down to one hertz.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Now eight hertz is special.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.870 align:middle line:84%
It is a natural
frequency, and is

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.290 align:middle line:84%
very close to the main
Schumann resonance

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:84%
peak, which is the Earth's
electromagnetic heartbeat.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.490 align:middle line:84%
As we learned
earlier, eight hertz

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.100 align:middle line:84%
is also the frequency
that marks that transition

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
between the alpha and the
theta brainwaves states,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's a number found
in the Fibonacci sequence.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.620 align:middle line:84%
So for all of these
reasons, Sauveur's system

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.990 align:middle line:84%
is called scientific or
philosophical tuning.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Sauveur went even further to
try and break that octave down

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.990 align:middle line:84%
into 3,010 parts based purely
on mathematical reasoning.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But as you can imagine, this
met with much resistance

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:90%
from the musicians.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.240 align:middle line:84%
They argued that such
small differences cannot be

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.810 align:middle line:84%
distinguished by the ear,
among other complaints.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Now because of this
backlash, his proposal

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:47.724 align:middle line:84%
for a standardized scientific
system of tuning was rejected.

00:25:47.724 --> 00:25:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Now this story is a
good example of why

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:57.090 align:middle line:84%
we must find a balance between
the art and the science

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:01.480 align:middle line:84%
rather than elevating one
at the expense of the other.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.980 align:middle line:84%
What are other
alternative tuning skills

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.280 align:middle line:84%
that sound healers and
alchemists are exploring

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.870 align:middle line:90%
besides scientific tuning?

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Well several are based on
the Solfeggio frequencies.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
What are the
Solfeggio frequencies?

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Well these are derived from
a more esoteric approach

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.350 align:middle line:90%
using numerology.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla once
said, if you only

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.440 align:middle line:84%
knew the magnificence
of the 3, 6, and 9,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.320 align:middle line:84%
then you would have the
key to the universe.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.810 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that
the Solfeggios are

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.560 align:middle line:84%
tones derived from a
cyclic variation of the

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
numbers 3, 6, 9; 1, 4, 7;
and 2, 5, 8, all of which

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.640 align:middle line:90%
reduced to sums of 3, 6, or 9.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.130 align:middle line:84%
These were the original
ut re mi fa so la ti.

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:55.170 align:middle line:84%
The Solfeggios are believed
to have been used centuries

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.210 align:middle line:84%
ago during religious
ceremonies, such as in Gregorian

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.410 align:middle line:90%
and Sanskrit chants.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.230 align:middle line:84%
They were then
later re-popularized

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:09.660 align:middle line:84%
by Leonard Horowitz and
Joseph Puleo starting in 1999.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:84%
They say that music
and chants tuned

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
to these special
frequencies are experienced

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:90%
a stimulating emotional release.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:22.530 align:middle line:84%
They can help
accelerate our healing,

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:84%
alter our perceptions
of time and space,

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and facilitate
spiritual transcendence.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Today, musicians work with
nine Solfeggio frequencies

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:38.250 align:middle line:10%
that are all neurologically
consistent with the criteria.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Each Solfeggio frequency
has unique characteristics

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and applications.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:49.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, 528 hertz is
called the miracle tone

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:53.730 align:middle line:84%
because it has been linked
to healing and DNA repair.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:84%
The Mystery School
perspective on this frequency

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:84%
is that it is in tune with
universal galactic vibrations.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:07.350 align:middle line:84%
This is the original vibration
of the first ensofic ray,

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:90%
The Hermetic Ray.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.270 align:middle line:84%
It is the frequency
that we humans

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
are meant to vibrate at as
our base frequency for life.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what life could be like,
what miracles would be possible

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.750 align:middle line:84%
if we were maintaining this
higher harmonious vibration

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.180 align:middle line:90%
as our base for life.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Can we change the course
of aging and disease,

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.960 align:middle line:84%
allowing for a more
vibrant and long life?

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps one day humanity
will live this way.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
It will take practical
application and a new way

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:84%
of living life day to day to
get there, but it is possible.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:84%
To work with Solfeggios,
we have to re imagine

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.410 align:middle line:90%
tuning all together.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
What's important is that
there's some intent and reason

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
behind the chosen
tuning frequency.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.660 align:middle line:10%
It's also about the
perceived difference

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:12.000 align:middle line:10%
to our norm, that is the key
to the neurological rewiring

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:10%
process.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.730 align:middle line:10%
As modern day composer
and sound alchemist JS

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.620 align:middle line:10%
Epperson, who works
as Solfeggio music

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:10%
combined with brainwave
entrainment, has said,

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:10%
Solfeggio tones are
effective because

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.190 align:middle line:10%
of the subtle
differences in tunings.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:84%
They jolt our brains into
perceiving something foreign.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, they
are inherently exotic,

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and at times alien relative
to what we are used to.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.700 align:middle line:84%
We reflexively pay
more attention to them,

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:84%
allowing our brain
to rewire faster.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we combine the
Solfeggio frequencies

00:29:55.190 --> 00:30:01.220 align:middle line:84%
with the Pythagorean scale, now
we have a winning combination.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Pythagorean tuning
is based on intervals

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.500 align:middle line:84%
that are in golden
proportion to each other.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.500 align:middle line:84%
This is based on
the proportions that

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:13.980 align:middle line:84%
are found in nature,
which is a 3 to 2 ratio.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:84%
This ratio is called the
pure or perfect fifth,

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:84%
because it is the most in
harmony and easy to tune

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.960 align:middle line:90%
by the ear.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It may sound ever so slightly
off-key to the well-trained ear

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that is accustomed to
the standardized tuning

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:36.290 align:middle line:84%
of our Western system,
but it feels better.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.020 align:middle line:84%
It creates harmony
within, and it brings us

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.080 align:middle line:90%
into greater homeostasis.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.410 align:middle line:84%
If a musician were to work
with any of the Solfeggio

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.670 align:middle line:90%
frequencies--

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:51.920 align:middle line:84%
my favorite one is 528 hertz,
but any of them are good--

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and then from that
particular frequency

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:84%
build an octave off of
that frequency using

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Pythagorean tuning or
golden ratio intervals,

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that could make for some
powerful healing music.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Now how do we make this
practice a way of life

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.780 align:middle line:84%
to entrain ourselves
into these frequencies?

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.740 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply these methods
for rewiring our braising step

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.470 align:middle line:90%
sound?

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, beyond listening
to the music tuned

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:84%
to these frequencies,
let's take a look

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.860 align:middle line:84%
at some other
practical tools we can

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.380 align:middle line:90%
begin to work with right away.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest tools
we have for specifically

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:84%
stimulating the
connective circuit

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.230 align:middle line:84%
between the temporals
and the prefrontal cortex

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:38.570 align:middle line:90%
is our own voice.

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.390 align:middle line:84%
We can use toning
to shift ourselves

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.540 align:middle line:84%
into more expanded
states of consciousness.

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Toning words of power,
like the Sanskrit word,

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.670 align:middle line:84%
ohm, creates a resonant
effect within our system.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Ohm is a very holy word.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.170 align:middle line:10%
It is said to be related
to the Sri Yantra,

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.270 align:middle line:10%
and it represents one of
the most mystical sounds

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.010 align:middle line:10%
of creation.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:08.910 align:middle line:10%
A daily practice of toning
ohm for 10 minutes each day

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.720 align:middle line:10%
is a powerful method
to bring yourself

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.780 align:middle line:10%
into a higher vibration.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.790 align:middle line:84%
If you also want
to tune your pitch

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.730 align:middle line:84%
to a particular frequency,
there are many apps

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.770 align:middle line:84%
that we can download on
our phones today that help.

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Another toning practice is to
work with the vowel sounds.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.618 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:32:30.618 --> 00:32:34.006 align:middle line:90%
[TONING]

00:32:34.006 --> 00:32:43.710 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.710 align:middle line:84%
This toning
synchronizes the brain

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:50.030 align:middle line:84%
from left to right, front
to back, and top-down.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to achieve
a whole brain state.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.920 align:middle line:84%
It also moves energy in the
different levels of our body.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.200 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Another tool to explore is
using somatic breath work.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.630 align:middle line:84%
With this technique, we
use our breath and sound

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:12.140 align:middle line:84%
to release tension
anywhere within our body.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
As we inhale, breathe
into that area of the body

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
where you feel
tension or discomfort.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Then, as you exhale,
allow a sound

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.640 align:middle line:90%
to come out with the breath.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It may sound like a sigh or a
grunt or primal animal sound.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:36.830 align:middle line:84%
However it sounds, it's OK,
the body needs that release.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We see animals do
this all the time.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.450 align:middle line:84%
They use sound not
only to communicate,

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:47.000 align:middle line:84%
but to semantically release
tension within the body.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.350 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we continue our
journey deeper into the brain

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and explore the
seat of our emotions

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and deeper states
of consciousness.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.400 align:middle line:84%
