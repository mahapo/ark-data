00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.710 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:10%
And today, I'm going to lead
you through a meditation

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:10%
on the archetypes of The
Magician and The High

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:10%
Priestess.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:10%
Now, together, these
awaken within us the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.515 align:middle line:10%
divine masculine and
feminine energies.

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:40.070 align:middle line:10%
The magician also shows us
how to contact and direct

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:10%
source energy, while The
High Priestess helps us

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.830 align:middle line:10%
with self-reflection,
introspection,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:10%
and gaining access
to hidden knowledge.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's now explore some practical
and experiential things

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to work with both
these archetypes, The Magician

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.370 align:middle line:90%
and The High Priestess.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Here's a formula to follow
for invoking these two

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.840 align:middle line:90%
archetypes into your life.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We'll first work with
one card at a time,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.240 align:middle line:90%
beginning with The Magician.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, find the
Magician card in your deck

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a meditation
stool or a cushion,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that with
a table in front of you.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And place the card
upright on the table.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Empty your mind and
make sure that you're

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
in a positive or at least
a neutral state of being,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:84%
meaning nothing's disturbing
you mentally or emotionally.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, look at the image of The
Magician card for a while,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:84%
about 5 to 10 minutes,
with your eyes open.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:90%
Study its imagery and symbolism.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.120 align:middle line:90%
Take in all the details.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Really allow it to
penetrate into your mind.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:09.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:07:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Then, take it inside.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.760 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and work with
it in your mind for another 10

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
minutes.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:90%
Recreate the image inside.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Bring all the level
of detail that you

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
can into this inner image as you
build it up within your mind.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.570 align:middle line:84%
Once the image is firmly
established in your mind,

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:90%
let it come to life.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Engage your active imagination.

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Use all five of your senses
and allow that magician

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.040 align:middle line:90%
to come to life.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Observe him for a while.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy that
The Magician emanates.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.825 align:middle line:84%
Notice how he behaves
and what he does.

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.530 align:middle line:84%
You might even ask a question or
receive some kind of a teaching

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.330 align:middle line:90%
from The Magician.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.180 align:middle line:10%
And then, when you're ready,
merge with The Magician.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:10%
Become The Magician.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:10%
See yourself as The Magician.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.870 align:middle line:10%
And again, use all
five of your senses

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.080 align:middle line:10%
to fully engage in this process
of becoming The Magician.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel
integrated with this energy,

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:10%
stand up and actually take on
the posture of The Magician.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:10%
Assume his archetypal form
and his body position,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:10%
putting your right hand up and
the left hand pointing down.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.640 align:middle line:10%
And holding that
position, you're

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.350 align:middle line:10%
going to say this affirmation.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:10%
I am the Magus of power.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:10%
It is by will alone that
I set my mind in motion.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, you'll do the same process
with The High Priestess card.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Begin with studying
and meditating

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:84%
upon The High Priestess
with your eyes

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:90%
open for 5 to 10 minutes again.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Take the image inside.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Build up that image inside.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And recreate all the
details within yourself.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.365 align:middle line:84%
And then, work with
it in your inner mind.

00:19:12.365 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:90%


00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Work this process again
for another 10 minutes

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
with the internal
building up of this image.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you're
ready, let her come to life.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Give her this freedom to
start to move, to express.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Use your active imagination.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Engage all five of your senses.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.660 align:middle line:90%
And observe her behavior.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Notice what she does.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe she has a
message or a teaching.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.575 align:middle line:84%
And feel her energy
and her ways of being.

00:19:44.575 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:10%
When you feel integrated with
this energy, sit up in a chair

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.480 align:middle line:10%
and actually take on the
posture of The High Priestess.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.390 align:middle line:10%
Assume her archetypal form.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.930 align:middle line:10%
Imagine yourself sitting
between those two pillars

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:10%
with a scroll in your lap,
a crown upon your head.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:01.450 align:middle line:10%
And from that position,
say this affirmation,

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:05.290 align:middle line:10%
I am The Priestess
of the Silver Star.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:10%
I am the Prima Materia.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.870 align:middle line:10%
All matter is
birthed through me.

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:90%


00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.540 align:middle line:10%
Next, place both The Magician
and The High Priestess

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.950 align:middle line:10%
cards next to each other,
with The Magician on the left

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:middle line:10%
and The High Priestess
on the right.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.150 align:middle line:10%
And meditate upon them together.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:10%
See how they
contrast each other.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.630 align:middle line:10%
Also see how they
complement each other.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:10%


00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.010 align:middle line:10%
The Magician stimulates
your will and ability

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:15.460 align:middle line:10%
to concentrate, while
The High Priestess

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:10%
stimulates your intuition
and memory abilities.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.040 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.850 align:middle line:10%
Give this some time of
working with them together.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.000 align:middle line:10%
And allow their energies to
harmonize and synchronize

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.470 align:middle line:10%
within you.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, the final step is
to take these energies

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.150 align:middle line:10%
and express them
into your outer life.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.660 align:middle line:10%
For example, bring
the primary colors

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:10%
of yellow for The Magician and
blue for The High Priestess

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.150 align:middle line:10%
into your environment
or your color of dress.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:10%
Also, meditate upon these
symbols and images daily

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:10%
for the next week.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.090 align:middle line:10%
Keep working with the cards
and the visualization process.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.300 align:middle line:10%
Also work with the
affirmations that we just used.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.430 align:middle line:10%
Use it every day.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of each card

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.930 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.960 align:middle line:10%
And watch for these archetypes
to appear in your dreams.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they do,
analyze their messages.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And pay attention to how
you embody the strengths

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.833 align:middle line:90%
and the weaknesses of each one.

00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, consciously
work to make

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:25.710 align:middle line:84%
improvements in these areas,
turning the shadow into light.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, realize, again, that
when working with archetypes,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.290 align:middle line:84%
they will set forces
in motion in your life.

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to really
engage this process

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:middle line:84%
and really work with
this experience,

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.110 align:middle line:84%
then commit to seeing it
all the way through, working

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
with each key in the full
order and sequence given,

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.630 align:middle line:84%
not skipping steps, really
giving it your full attention.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.060 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.910 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:04.000 align:middle line:90%
