00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.300 align:middle line:10%
Is there a way to
awaken our DNA potential

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.150 align:middle line:10%
and turn on our dormant genes?

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.810 align:middle line:10%
To find out, let's unfold both
the science and metaphysics

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.250 align:middle line:10%
of our DNA blueprints.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:84%
We've explored many
mysteries of the universe

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
through this series from
the quantum to the cosmic.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
We now see that we are truly
multidimensional beings

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.890 align:middle line:90%
of vast potential.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:84%
We know that our consciousness
can affect matter

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.660 align:middle line:90%
through the quantum field.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And we know that we are
connected to the whole universe

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.110 align:middle line:90%
through entanglement.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's now explore how our DNA
interacts with the quantum

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
What does our DNA have to
do with the quantum field?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, aside from the fact that
our DNA is made of molecules

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.480 align:middle line:84%
which are comprised
of atoms, they

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
contain subatomic particles
and quantum fields.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.560 align:middle line:84%
DNA has actually been shown
to directly communicate

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:84%
with and even
organize the quantum

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:90%
field in some fascinating ways.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.150 align:middle line:84%
The first of these
has been coined

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.880 align:middle line:90%
as the DNA phantom effect.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:10%
In 1985, Russian scientist
Dr. Peter Gariaev

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.600 align:middle line:10%
discovered a
shocking phenomenon.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
By placing a sample of DNA
into a sealed vacuum chamber,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.610 align:middle line:84%
he then exposed it to
low power laser light

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and analyzed how the photons
scattered through the chamber.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Prior to placing the
DNA in the chamber,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the photons scattered
in a random way,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.090 align:middle line:90%
indicating no structure.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
But when the DNA was placed
inside the vacuum chamber,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
the photons arranged themselves
around the DNA structure.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:90%
They were organized by it.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
After removing
the DNA, they then

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.060 align:middle line:84%
found a most
unexpected phenomenon.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.080 align:middle line:84%
The photons were still
being ordered in the vacuum

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
by some new field
structure or memory

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that they later called
the phantom DNA.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:84%
They tested other substances
and did not find this effect

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:90%
for anything but DNA.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the effect lasted
for long periods,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:84%
upwards of a month, as long
as the space inside the vacuum

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:90%
chamber remained undisturbed.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.265 align:middle line:90%
What does this tell us?

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that
through the DNA,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
we can influence the quantum
vacuum and the information it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.920 align:middle line:90%
contains.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Plus, as we'll see later, we
can also influence our DNA

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
through our thoughts,
words, and actions,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
which then adjust
what possibilities

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.850 align:middle line:84%
are available to us
from the quantum domain.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
The researchers were able
to reproduce this DNA

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
phantom effect so long as
two conditions were met.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.840 align:middle line:10%
The first was the presence
of the DNA molecule

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:10%
must be introduced
into the vacuum.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And the second was
that the DNA must then

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.320 align:middle line:84%
be exposed to weak
coherent laser radiation.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.016 align:middle line:84%
And what do laser light and
DNA have to do with each other?

00:03:27.016 --> 00:03:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, this brings us to the
second fascinating thing

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:90%
about DNA and quantum fields.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Living DNA is a receiver and
transmitter of coherent light.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:90%
Let's repeat that.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Living DNA is both a
receiver and transmitter

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:90%
of coherent light.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
This was first documented
by an international group

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
of scientists led by German
biophysicist Dr. Fritz Popp.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
They discovered that the DNA
actually emits and receives

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.100 align:middle line:84%
low intensity, coherent
light called biophotons.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Scientists think that what are
called the non-coding parts

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA are what govern
the transmission and reception

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
of this light and
that biophotons

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.280 align:middle line:84%
are used as a light
speed communication

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.399 align:middle line:90%
mechanism for the web of DNA.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
They propose it's like
a biological internet.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean for us?

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that we can
also use coherent light

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with our DNA.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
If we can give the
right information

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to a certain set
of DNA in our body,

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
that message will then be
transmitted to the rest

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:90%
of our DNA at light speed.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Now this word coherent
comes up again and again

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
when we talk about
the quantum field.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean?

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, coherent means all of
the same frequency or vibratory

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.860 align:middle line:84%
rate, all in phase
or synchronized,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
all moving together in the
same focused direction.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
This piece is really
key when it comes

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:84%
to awakening DNA because
we have to achieve

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:90%
a coherent state to do so.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
We'll return to this idea
of coherence in a moment.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
First, let's go back to
the Russian scientists who

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:90%
studied the DNA phantom effect.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
These guys later also discovered
that vibrational energy, words,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and sounds of the
right frequencies

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:90%
can communicate with the DNA.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:84%
They found that the
non-coding sections of DNA

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.130 align:middle line:84%
follow the same syntax
rules as human languages.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
It says if language is already
inherent within our DNA code,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and indeed it is as
we'll see in a moment.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, DNA can
be influenced and reprogrammed

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:90%
by words and frequencies.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Using what they
call wave genetics,

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.230 align:middle line:84%
these Russian
scientists explored

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.610 align:middle line:84%
the vibrational
behavior of living DNA.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And what they found is that
living DNA reacts to language

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.920 align:middle line:84%
so long as the proper
frequencies are used.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And the way they tested
this was by modulating

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.320 align:middle line:84%
the words onto laser
light and radio waves

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.720 align:middle line:84%
tuned to the right
frequencies and then

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.460 align:middle line:84%
beamed this at the DNA to
observe how it would respond.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They concluded that DNA acts
like a holographic, biological

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:84%
internet using light, words,
and sounds to communicate.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:84%
This is fascinating
because it agrees

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient
teachings of Kabbalah

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.340 align:middle line:84%
from the Sefer Yetzirah
that say that God engraved

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:90%
his name by three Seraphim--

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.095 align:middle line:90%
numbers, letters, and sounds.

00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Numbers here refer to frequency
or the core essence of light.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Letters are patterns
of movement that

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:84%
combine to form
words or language,

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.010 align:middle line:84%
while sounds are the expression
of vibrational energy

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that directly impacts
and shapes matter.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps this responsiveness
that DNA has to language

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
is one reason why things like
affirmations and the words we

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.160 align:middle line:84%
speak can have strong effects on
the body, as well as the mind.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
But to get a positive
effect rather than

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
a negative or no effect, we
must use the correct frequency.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
What is meant by the
correct frequency?

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, on one hand, we could
talk about musical tunings,

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.780 align:middle line:10%
such as working with solfeggio
frequencies like 528 hertz

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:10%
or a natural 432
hertz tuning scale,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.860 align:middle line:10%
or perhaps working with
golden ratio harmonics.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's more to
it than just this.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.520 align:middle line:84%
It really has to do with
our inner frequency being

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.290 align:middle line:84%
in a coherent state, aligned
with reverence, sacredness,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:84%
joy, love, gratitude,
and so forth.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It is this inner vibration that
gets communicated through voice

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:90%
and the words we speak.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.105 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore this idea
of language and the DNA

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:90%
a bit more.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
DNA gives all the
codes and instructions

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.165 align:middle line:84%
necessary to create
an entire you.

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
That same DNA is in every cell
of our body, all 100 trillion

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:90%
of them.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:90%
We truly are holographic beings.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Every cell contains
the blueprint

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:90%
of the whole within it.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA is a book of
life, an instruction

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:46.300 align:middle line:84%
manual for everything about us,
both physical and spiritual.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything from the color of
our eyes to the unique gifts

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.520 align:middle line:84%
we are each here
to express and even

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
the purpose we are here
to fulfill in this life,

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.820 align:middle line:90%
it's all written in our DNA.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to wake it
up so that we can fully

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:84%
access and manifest
our potential

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.380 align:middle line:90%
and purpose in this life.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Traditional DNA science
tells us that nucleic acids

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.240 align:middle line:84%
form the letters of
our genetic language.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Groups of three
letters form codons,

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:90%
which are like root words.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:84%
There are then 64 total
root words or codons

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.520 align:middle line:90%
in our genetic language.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Then the genes are more like
sentences and paragraphs

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.880 align:middle line:84%
with anywhere between
hundreds to thousands

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.970 align:middle line:90%
of letters per gene.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:84%
20 of these codons
are called exons

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that are used to create
amino acids, which

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
build the proteins
that build the body.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:10%
But as of the new millennium,
science now says that only 1%

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:10%
of the human genome
is composed of exons.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
For the last 100 years,
Western scientists

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
have been so caught up in this
1% that they have practically

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:06.100 align:middle line:84%
ignored the other 99%, calling
it junk DNA simply because they

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:90%
don't know what it does.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.870 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, this is changing.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Four of those codons
form start and stop codes

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:90%
for genetic transcription.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Then the remaining 40 codons
of our genetic language

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:84%
comprise the other 99% of our
DNA, which traditional science

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.695 align:middle line:90%
is now calling non-coding DNA.

00:10:26.695 --> 00:10:29.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
Now while science may call
this junk or even non-coding,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
we say it has
potential that has yet

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:90%
to be manifested or turned on.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
What do we know about
this 99% of our DNA?

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
First, a huge amount
of energy goes

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
into preserving and
replicating this DNA.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
If 99% was really
junk and not needed,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:84%
then evolution would have
cut it out a long time ago.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.270 align:middle line:84%
More recent research has
shown that these sections are

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:84%
actually really important
and have several functions.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:10.890 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, it turns out
that more advanced species

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.580 align:middle line:84%
tend to have huge stretches
of these non-coding sections

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.580 align:middle line:90%
between short segments of exons.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, they are
important ingredients

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
that provide variability
and hold the keys to some

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.600 align:middle line:84%
of the main physical differences
that distinguish humans

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.820 align:middle line:90%
from all other species.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.270 align:middle line:84%
They are part of
what make us human.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, these
sections help to regulate

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.160 align:middle line:90%
which genes get expressed.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And they govern structural
confirmations of DNA,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
determining which genes are
even accessible to be expressed.

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:84%
This is central to the process
of turning on more expression

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.250 align:middle line:90%
of our genetic potential.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:10%
In March 2019, a
collaboration of scientists

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.600 align:middle line:10%
from Harvard University,
UC Berkeley, and MIT

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:10%
led by Dr. Andrew Gehrke
published new findings of how

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.340 align:middle line:10%
a particular part of
non-coding sections of DNA

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.660 align:middle line:10%
might hold the master switch to
turning on our body's ability

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:10%
to regenerate itself.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard of or seen how
salamanders, geckos, jellyfish,

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and certain kinds of worms
are able to regrow body parts.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.120 align:middle line:84%
What the scientists
have found is

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that a section of non-coding
DNA controls the activation

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:84%
of a master control gene
known as the early growth

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:90%
response or EGR.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
This EGR is like
the master power

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.740 align:middle line:84%
switch to activating
other genes that

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:90%
are involved in regeneration.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Without this master
switch turned on,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
the other switches and genes
downstream of it won't work.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle line:10%
It's much like how when a
circuit breaker goes off,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.340 align:middle line:10%
none of the power outlets
or lights connected to it

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:10%
will work.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
This EGR gene is present
in humans as well.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
It can get turned on
when our cells are

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
exposed to a mechanical
or chemical stress.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But humans obviously
don't regenerate nearly

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.130 align:middle line:84%
as well as salamanders
or worms that

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:90%
have lost entire body parts.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, scientists
are now proposing

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
that it may be due to the
wiring or the connective network

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.620 align:middle line:84%
of the whole channel of
genes and epigenetic switches

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
in both the coding and
non-coding sections of DNA.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
What this means is
that it is not just

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.540 align:middle line:84%
the presence of the individual
switches or genes like EGR.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But it is our epigenetic
and non-coding DNA

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.650 align:middle line:90%
wiring that is very different.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible for humans
to activate this ability

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:84%
to regenerate
ourselves more fully?

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.580 align:middle line:84%
If scientists can figure out
what the proper connections

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.610 align:middle line:84%
are, they might be able
to understand how to turn

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:90%
on our regenerative abilities.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Talk about something that could
bring a revolution in medicine.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.870 align:middle line:84%
We might have the power
to innately regrow limbs

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and organs that
have become damaged.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But what is the main
highlight of this study?

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, it shows that
scientists are now

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.450 align:middle line:84%
realizing that our genetic
code and the expression

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:28.140 align:middle line:84%
of its full potential
relies on several layers

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and interactions between
different parts of the DNA.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Originally, scientists
thought that the secrets

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.950 align:middle line:84%
to our genetic potential
rested entirely

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.000 align:middle line:84%
within the genes or the
coding sections of DNA.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:84%
After completing the
Human Genome Project,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:84%
they realized that this section
only accounted for 1% to 2%

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:90%
of the DNA.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And they were mystified.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Next came the
epigenetic revolution

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:84%
where we realized there is
a layer above the genes that

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.320 align:middle line:84%
act as the on and off
switches to control the genes.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Now scientists are
discovering there is yet

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.380 align:middle line:84%
another layer of programming
language of our DNA,

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.580 align:middle line:84%
and it may be the
most important yet,

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
meaning these networked
interconnections

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:84%
between the coding
and non-coding

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and epigenetic portions, this
larger scale interaction,

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:84%
regulates the whole process
of genetic expression.

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.030 align:middle line:84%
A part of how it does this is
through the DNA's confirmation.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does that mean?

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, typically DNA
is tightly folded

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and compacted around histones
within the chromosomes.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:84%
In order for new areas to
become activated in our DNA,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the confirmation of
the DNA must change.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It must physically open up more
and relax its folding in order

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.630 align:middle line:84%
to grant access to the
epigenetic switches that

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.970 align:middle line:90%
turn our genes on and off.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
It must physically open up more
and relax its folding in order

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
to grant access to the
epigenetic switches that

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.060 align:middle line:90%
turn our genes on or off.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:84%
The Dr. Gehrke
collaborators are now

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
proclaiming that the answers to
what controls this regulation

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:84%
lies in the non-coding
sections of DNA

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.800 align:middle line:84%
and that we must
study the whole DNA

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:84%
sequence and its interactions,
not just the coding sections,

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:84%
if we want to unlock
our DNA secrets.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, these non-coding
sections of DNA, this 99%,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.190 align:middle line:84%
is turning out to
be really essential,

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.520 align:middle line:90%
especially for us humans.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way for us to
unlock our DNA's potential

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.210 align:middle line:84%
before scientists figure
out how it really works?

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Fortunately, yes.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
There are things we can
do to aid this process.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Recall from earlier how the
non-coding sections of DNA

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:84%
have shown to be more
highly ordered and patterned

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.510 align:middle line:90%
than the coding ones.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.340 align:middle line:90%
They resemble a human language.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And it is this 99% of the
DNA's non-coding sections

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
that also communicate
via light or biophotons,

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:90%
not just via biochemistry.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.960 align:middle line:84%
It is these segments of
non-coding DNA and the ways

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
that it responds to the
right frequencies of light

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and language, as well as how
it interacts with the quantum

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
vacuum, that are key to
our ability to communicate

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.110 align:middle line:90%
with our DNA and wake it up.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Ancient spiritual teachings have
known for thousands of years

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that our body is programmable
by certain language, words,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:84%
thought, and
spiritual practices.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:84%
The secret, as scientists
are now verifying,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it has to be the
right inner frequencies.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:84%
This is why not everybody
is able to do it

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
with equal mastery
or do it on their own

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:84%
without receiving the proper
training and keys to unlocking

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.536 align:middle line:90%
the powers within.

00:18:00.536 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:10%
The individual person must
work on the inner processes

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:10%
of mastery in order to establish
a level of consciousness

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.730 align:middle line:10%
and coherence that
can then intentionally

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.370 align:middle line:10%
communicate with the DNA.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
The more well-trained an
individual's consciousness is,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.400 align:middle line:84%
the more they can
activate their own codes

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
without much need for
any external stimulus

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to accessing heightened states
for reprogramming the DNA.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So how does one develop
their consciousness

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.540 align:middle line:84%
to start reprogramming
the DNA expression

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:90%
and awaken its potential?

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Ready?

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
Here come some keys.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And in the Mystery
School tradition,

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
when we're about
to receive keys,

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
it's best to sit in an open
and receptive position.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's do that now.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that your hands
and feet are uncrossed.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.720 align:middle line:90%
Palms are up open on your lap.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
in through the nose

00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and out through the
mouth and relax.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.950 align:middle line:90%
And the keys are--

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.760 align:middle line:84%
key number one,
use the right map.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:84%
This helps us to better
navigate and understand

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.820 align:middle line:84%
the intricacies of this coded
blueprint that is our DNA.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Key number two, hold the
correct sacred geometries

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
within our mind
and energy field.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Key number three, access
a state of coherence

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
to harness our light,
intention, and desire.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.790 align:middle line:10%
And key four, expressing
proper holy words or words

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.640 align:middle line:10%
of power using
specific harmonics

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:10%
and methods of harnessing the
body as an instrument of sound.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Each of these keys
has many layers

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:90%
of deeper mysteries behind them.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Let's unpack this a
bit more to reveal

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:84%
that next layer of
what these keys mean

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and how we know
these are correct.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:10%
In ancient times, the best of
the best of shamans and sages,

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:10%
healers, alchemists, initiates,
and spiritual masters

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.140 align:middle line:10%
from around the world got
together over 3,000 years ago

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:10%
in the temples of King Solomon.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Their mission was
to find the keys

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
to awakening divine
human potential,

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.330 align:middle line:84%
including in the
people who were not

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
able to dedicate their entire
lives to living like monks

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.350 align:middle line:84%
and meditating or doing
spiritual practices all day

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:90%
long to first achieve mastery.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:84%
They wanted all of humanity
to awaken and ascend,

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
not just the few,
and because they

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
believe we are all
eternal beings,

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:84%
we are all of divine
origin, and we are all

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.550 align:middle line:90%
meant to remember this.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And together, they collaborated,
tested methods, traded secrets,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and trained for over
22 years, searching

00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:00.280 align:middle line:84%
for a universal system that
worked on everybody, regardless

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.960 align:middle line:84%
of race, color, age, gender,
location, genetic line,

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:90%
culture, any of it.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:90%
It had to work universally.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Through this process, they
created an extensive repertoire

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:84%
of healings, activations,
and initiations each

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.930 align:middle line:84%
addressing a different aspect
of our multidimensional being.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.720 align:middle line:84%
And these universal modalities
are still intact today.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.340 align:middle line:84%
They have been tested and
perfected over the millennia

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and shown to work for all
who receive these activations

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
from properly trained initiates
of the Mystery School lineages,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
initiates who can hold the
right frequencies to facilitate

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.210 align:middle line:90%
and speed up the process.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the cornerstones of this
system that really plugs us

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.800 align:middle line:84%
back into the light
of higher potential

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
is a modality known as
the life activation.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.410 align:middle line:10%
This activation awakens
our core blueprints

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:10%
at both the physical
and spiritual levels.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:10%
It helps us to
become more aware.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:10%
And it fertilizes the
ground of our being

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:10%
so that any other seeds
we plant in our life

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:10%
can take root and grow stronger.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.560 align:middle line:84%
It brings dormant parts of us
into an active and aware state,

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to tap a reservoir
of energy and resources

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that were previously
out of reach.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.210 align:middle line:84%
As a result, we move
into a state of light

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that helps us more
clearly and intuitively

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.380 align:middle line:84%
realign with our higher
purpose and potential.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.350 align:middle line:84%
It was this life activation
and the result I personally

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
experienced from it that
set me on the path of diving

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
further into the Mystery
School tradition.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.250 align:middle line:84%
What was it that these
ancient sages considered

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.170 align:middle line:90%
as our core blueprint?

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.430 align:middle line:84%
Without knowing about
the molecule of life AKA

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.000 align:middle line:84%
deoxyribonucleic
acid, or DNA, how

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.290 align:middle line:84%
did they define what
they were awakening?

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.250 align:middle line:84%
This is where the use of
the right map comes in.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon was
a master Kabbalist

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.280 align:middle line:84%
who also had exposure to many
other mystical and magical

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.990 align:middle line:84%
He worked to relate everything
he learned from the world's

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions and
universal teachings back

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.340 align:middle line:84%
to his understanding of
Kabbalah and the tree of life.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:84%
According to Kabbalah,
the tree of life

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.710 align:middle line:84%
is the original
blueprint of life.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:10%
This pattern also ties into the
caduceus or the Staff of Hermes

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:10%
from the alchemical
and hermetic tradition,

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:10%
which represents that DNA helix
as well as the Kundalini rising

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:10%
up the spinal column.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:46.010 align:middle line:84%
This pattern is the core
sacred geometry or scaffolding

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.850 align:middle line:84%
around which the DNA is
structured or organized.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Each aspect of this pattern
has specific divine codes,

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
energies, and information
stored within it.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.570 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 Sefirot plus
the hidden one called

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Daat plus the
Ein-Sof, or source,

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.550 align:middle line:84%
bringing the total to 12 key
aspects of the tree of life.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Then there are 12
physical and 12 spiritual,

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
making it actually become 24 key
aspects of the DNA blueprint.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
If we take tree of life upon
tree of life upon tree of life,

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.080 align:middle line:84%
we build up what is
called Jacob's ladder.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.200 align:middle line:84%
We then just give it a
right-handed or clockwise

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.100 align:middle line:90%
twist.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.360 align:middle line:84%
We now have our double
helix of the physical DNA

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.000 align:middle line:84%
with a central axis of
pure light and energy

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.120 align:middle line:84%
running up and down
the middle pillar.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's take
this a step further

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
because the true tree of
life is not two-dimensional.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It's of a higher
multi-dimensionality.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It has both physical and
spiritual components.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the
three-dimensional tree of life,

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.770 align:middle line:84%
we have four pillars
surrounding a central core.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:10%
And based on this structure,
if we now stack tree of life

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:10%
upon tree of life
and tree of life

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:10%
and then rotate it into a helix,
we get a four-stranded helix

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:10%
with a central axis of light and
energy going down the middle.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Within this
four-stranded structure,

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:10%
we have the 24 key aspects
of God or the divine within

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:10%
the DNA--

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.870 align:middle line:10%
12 physical and 12 spiritual.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:32.660 align:middle line:84%
This tree is the signature
of God within our DNA.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.060 align:middle line:84%
If we look at this
three-dimensional tree

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:39.110 align:middle line:84%
from the above view, we see
that there are four points

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:90%
surrounding a central point.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbolic
pattern that we

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.580 align:middle line:84%
find in many ancient
traditions around the world,

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.780 align:middle line:84%
such as the Celtic cross, the
Templar cross, the medicine

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:84%
wheel, and so forth, all
pointing to the same knowledge.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:84%
The four outer pillars relate
to the four elements, the four

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:03.080 align:middle line:84%
watchtowers, the four
cardinal directions, the four

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.120 align:middle line:90%
forces of creation, and so on.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Each of them within
the DNA acts as a kind

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
of coding platform or terminal
for the process of creation.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And within each of
these four, there

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.070 align:middle line:84%
are many more layers or
levels, all organized according

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to sacred numbers and the
holographic model for the whole

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:90%
being reflected in every part.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Then in the center
of all of this,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:84%
there is a central core, which
is where the light from source

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.430 align:middle line:90%
or that fifth element flows.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.630 align:middle line:84%
By and large, most people
have only a portion, maybe two

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:46.160 align:middle line:84%
to three sections, of one part
of this structure activated,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.740 align:middle line:90%
some more, some less.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.800 align:middle line:84%
As a metaphysician having
studied sacred geometry

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.080 align:middle line:84%
and Kabbalah, I've
been fascinated

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.300 align:middle line:84%
with this Mystery School
teaching about the DNA

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.400 align:middle line:84%
and the tree of life
ever since I was first

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.010 align:middle line:90%
exposed to it in 2001.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:05.300 align:middle line:84%
But as scientists, we are always
looking to validate theory

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:90%
with tangible evidence.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.610 align:middle line:84%
The first hints of this evidence
that I could find finally

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:84%
started to appear
in January 2013.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Scientists at Cambridge
confirmed the existence

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:22.220 align:middle line:84%
of a naturally occurring,
four-stranded DNA structures

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:90%
within living human cells.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.280 align:middle line:84%
They published their findings in
the journal "Nature Chemistry"

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:84%
that there is a quadruple
helix or quadruplex DNA

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:90%
structure in the human genome.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:84%
They found a higher
concentration

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.180 align:middle line:84%
of this four-stranded
DNA is clearly

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.400 align:middle line:90%
linked to DNA replication.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.260 align:middle line:84%
This is crucial to the process
of cell division and renewal

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:90%
that support life.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.510 align:middle line:84%
This view of the
four-stranded DNA

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.910 align:middle line:90%
is what we call an axial view.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
This shows a
computer-generated model

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:84%
of what just one twist of the
DNA quadruplex looks like.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.795 align:middle line:84%
Notice how it aligns
with the axial

00:28:05.795 --> 00:28:11.190 align:middle line:84%
view from above of the
three-dimensional tree of life.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the axial view
of two twists of the DNA helix,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.100 align:middle line:90%
it will look more octagonal.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.650 align:middle line:84%
We get the same
octagon structure

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.440 align:middle line:84%
when we rotate the
three-dimensional tree of life

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.120 align:middle line:90%
by 45 degrees.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.190 align:middle line:84%
This geometric structure then
repeats itself over and over

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.940 align:middle line:84%
again with each new
twist of the DNA helix.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Thus, in addition to the
ladder-like structure

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:84%
of the DNA that we see
in the tree of life,

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.610 align:middle line:84%
the octagon is also
very essential form

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.610 align:middle line:90%
that relates to our DNA.

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, we call this
the octagon of power.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.640 align:middle line:10%
We also find the octagon in
the Taoist I Ching system

00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:00.020 align:middle line:10%
and various forms of
martial arts from the east.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Here again, we see
a very universal

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometric and
mathematical system showing up

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:11.530 align:middle line:84%
in both Eastern and Western
mystical traditions.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
In both I Ching and
Kabbalah, as well as alchemy,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:20.500 align:middle line:84%
we start with a binary system
emerging out of the oneness.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:25.900 align:middle line:84%
These are the yin and yang,
the pillars of force and form,

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.000 align:middle line:84%
the fixed and the
volatile essences

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.780 align:middle line:84%
of feminine and masculine
or Luna and Sol that

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.290 align:middle line:90%
emerged from the prima materia.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
In science, we might call them
negative and positive charges

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that we find in many particles,
such as with the electron

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.130 align:middle line:90%
and the proton.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The I Ching depicts these as a
broken line and a solid line.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.420 align:middle line:84%
This basic binary
can then be formed

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:58.090 align:middle line:84%
into four permutations or
combinations of yin and yang.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, there are four pillars
of the three-dimensional tree

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of life that relate to the
four philosophical elements

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.170 align:middle line:90%
of alchemy.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:13.030 align:middle line:10%
And in our DNA, it is built
from four nucleic acids or bases

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:16.490 align:middle line:10%
that they call the letters
of the genetic code.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.060 align:middle line:10%
These four permutations
are also arranged

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:10%
in groups of three known
as trigrams in I Ching.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Then on the tree of life, we
see that each of the pillars

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:84%
has three Sefirot,
bringing us to 12.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.930 align:middle line:10%
And the DNA code
has three letters

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.260 align:middle line:10%
that form a codon, which gives
the instructions for creating

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.510 align:middle line:10%
amino acids.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.030 align:middle line:10%
And just like the DNA
has two strands that

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.090 align:middle line:10%
reflect each other,
the trigrams can also

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:10%
be paired up to create a total
of 64 different combinations.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.830 align:middle line:84%
These form the 64 hexagrams
of the I Ching system.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.570 align:middle line:10%
We find the same number
system in Kabbalah

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.020 align:middle line:10%
when we work with the
geometry of dividing the four

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:10%
sides of a square
to become an octagon

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:11.770 align:middle line:10%
and then divide again to
become a 16-sided polygon,

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.270 align:middle line:10%
and again to form a
32-sided polygon, which

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.980 align:middle line:10%
is another Kabbalistic
number that

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.360 align:middle line:10%
relates to the 32 paths of
wisdom on the tree of life.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.510 align:middle line:10%
And then the 32 can
be divided once more

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.020 align:middle line:10%
to form a 64-sided polygon.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
These relate to the 64
codons that form the root

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:35.130 align:middle line:90%
words of our genetic code.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:39.750 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, there is a clear
symmetry between the I Ching,

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.845 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistic tree of
life, and our DNA.

00:31:41.845 --> 00:31:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:10%
Richard Rudd, the author
of the "Gene Keys,"

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.430 align:middle line:10%
has gone as far as to say that
the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:10%
can be used as a code that
talks directly to our DNA.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And as I've shown
here, this system

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.180 align:middle line:84%
can be matched up
with the top view

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.600 align:middle line:84%
of the three-dimensional
tree of life.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.990 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of working with
the Kabbalistic tree of life

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:11.470 align:middle line:84%
in three dimensions is that
we not only get the top view,

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
we can also see the more
detailed side view structure

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of the tree that really
gives us a clear framework

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.370 align:middle line:90%
for communicating to our DNA.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have a clear
idea of the right map

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.950 align:middle line:84%
and some of its
sacred geometry, how

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:30.910 align:middle line:84%
do we work with the third key of
accessing a state of coherence

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:84%
to harness our light,
intentions, and desires?

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the metaphysical
teachings on manifestation

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:84%
is that we must bring about
a successful combination

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.590 align:middle line:84%
of intense desire
and concentration

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:90%
with an appropriate object.

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:84%
In this case, an
appropriate object

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.370 align:middle line:90%
is our intent or purpose.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Intense desire is
the fuel or force

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:01.030 align:middle line:84%
that draws the energy to us and
sends it towards our objective.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:10%
Concentration is the
ability to achieve a focused

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:10%
mind and coherent state
of being, directing

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.480 align:middle line:10%
our desire with laser-like
focus towards our intent.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:84%
To achieve coherence, meditation
and being able to quiet

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.100 align:middle line:90%
and focus the mind is essential.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.470 align:middle line:84%
But meditation
alone is not enough.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.070 align:middle line:84%
We must learn to
harness our will.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.390 align:middle line:84%
Returning to science for
a moment, in epigenetics,

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.120 align:middle line:84%
it says that the
layer above the genes

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.900 align:middle line:84%
acts as the on and off
switches for the genetic code.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And these switches
are influenced

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:45.790 align:middle line:84%
by certain actions, intentions,
environment, and choices.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Within our epigenetic
layers, when a methyl group

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:53.020 align:middle line:84%
attaches to a gene,
it represses or turns

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.150 align:middle line:90%
off that genes' activity.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:34:00.190 align:middle line:84%
When it detaches, it turns
on the genetic expression.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Additionally, extra
molecules that

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:84%
attach to the tails of
the histones proteins

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:84%
alter the way in which
the DNA wraps itself

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.060 align:middle line:90%
around those histones.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:84%
How tightly or loosely
wound the histones are

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.400 align:middle line:84%
affects whether the DNA can
be expressed or accessed.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Here's the most empowering part
about what epigenetic science

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.110 align:middle line:90%
is revealing.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.900 align:middle line:84%
These layers respond
to many things

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.360 align:middle line:84%
that give us the
power to influence

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.699 align:middle line:90%
our genetic expression.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the choices we
make, the actions we take,

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.719 align:middle line:84%
not only affect
our DNA expression,

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
their influence also gets
passed on to future generations,

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.380 align:middle line:84%
up to at least
seven generations,

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:84%
and some studies have shown
even as much as 14 generations

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:49.989 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:54.850 align:middle line:84%
This means we have both huge
responsibility and opportunity.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Here are the
practical things that

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:02.020 align:middle line:84%
impact our DNA that we have the
power to change if we choose.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:90%
First, our environment.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.600 align:middle line:84%
What we breathe, what
we eat and drink,

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.140 align:middle line:84%
the products we put on our
skin, the lifestyle choices

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and habits, our stress
levels, all of this

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.840 align:middle line:90%
affects chemistry in the body.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Second, our mental beliefs.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Our expectations, thoughts,
attitudes, what we focus on,

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:84%
this all ties into the quantum
observer effect as well.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Third, our emotional attitudes
the HeartMath Institute

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:35.590 align:middle line:84%
published a study
in 2003 that showed

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:39.430 align:middle line:84%
when a person is experiencing
motions of a low vibration,

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
such as fear or worry,
their DNA tightens up

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.970 align:middle line:84%
or contracts, which
then restricts access

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:90%
to the genetic potential.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.860 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if they
experience a high vibration,

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.840 align:middle line:84%
such as love, joy, gratitude,
their DNA relaxes its coil,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and it expands, granting access
to more genetic expression.

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.090 align:middle line:84%
This brings us back
to the concepts

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:08.110 align:middle line:84%
on expansion and coherence
and how we regulate

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.510 align:middle line:90%
our genetic expression.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:14.830 align:middle line:84%
The more we expand and achieve
a heightened state of coherence,

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.840 align:middle line:84%
the more we can
access our potential.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Now our fourth epigenetic
key are the words we use.

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:28.450 align:middle line:84%
For better or for worse, our DNA
responds to the words we speak.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Every word we speak goes into
all levels of the DNA system.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.490 align:middle line:84%
This is why it is so
important to clean up

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:39.190 align:middle line:84%
our use of words
and frame things

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
in positive and
uplifting words, rather

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:46.390 align:middle line:84%
than complaining, or gossiping,
or spreading negativity.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:49.360 align:middle line:84%
The person who uses
words in a negative way

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.640 align:middle line:90%
hurts themselves and others.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:84%
How can we use
the power of words

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.940 align:middle line:84%
in a way that
really benefits us?

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.460 align:middle line:90%
This brings us to the final key.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:84%
To activate something,
we need a spark.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.630 align:middle line:84%
One way that we can create
a spark or that fire

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:11.920 align:middle line:84%
transformation is through
the use of holy words.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.810 align:middle line:84%
By the expression of the proper
holy words or words of power,

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.350 align:middle line:84%
when spoken or
toned correctly, we

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:26.220 align:middle line:84%
can bring in the spark
to activate the codes.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.840 align:middle line:90%
What do we mean by correctly?

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means at specific
harmonics and frequencies,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
plus using certain
methods that harness

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.540 align:middle line:84%
the capacity of the body to
be an instrument of sound.

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Our aim is always to take
knowledge into application

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:48.520 align:middle line:84%
so that we can directly
experience it, progress,

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.310 align:middle line:90%
and come to truly understand.

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge alone does
us no good, unless we

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.400 align:middle line:84%
can use it to transform and
ascend towards our greater

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.780 align:middle line:90%
potential and purpose.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.540 align:middle line:84%
So in that spirit,
here is a method

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that can be used
right away to start

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.670 align:middle line:84%
turning on and
consciously accessing

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:90%
more of our potential.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.840 align:middle line:84%
First, we must hold the
correct sacred geometries

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
within our mind
and energy field.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's begin by
standing or sitting.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.200 align:middle line:90%
Breathe deeply and relax.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Start building up the image
of the two-dimensional tree

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.380 align:middle line:84%
of life in our mind
and on our body.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Once this is firmly
established, next,

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:84%
build the three-dimensional tree
of life within and around us.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.810 align:middle line:84%
Here our central core is
aligned with the middle pillar.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the four outer pillars
are around us with two in front

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:47.160 align:middle line:90%
and two in back of us.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Hold this image while focusing
on the breath in and out.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:59.070 align:middle line:84%
Come into coherent state
of quiet, yet focused mind.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Now gently bring your attention
to the heart at the very center

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.910 align:middle line:90%
of the tree of life.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy expand as a
bright, yellow sun shining

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.510 align:middle line:90%
in the center of your chest.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Let it open the heart and
expand to fill the entire body

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.830 align:middle line:90%
and aura.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.740 align:middle line:84%
As your aura fills
with this light,

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:27.180 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to tone
from the belly this power word

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:30.060 align:middle line:90%
four times.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Agla.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:40.476 align:middle line:90%


00:39:40.476 --> 00:39:41.276 align:middle line:90%
Agla.

00:39:41.276 --> 00:39:51.388 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.388 --> 00:39:52.188 align:middle line:90%
Agla.

00:39:52.188 --> 00:40:02.300 align:middle line:90%


00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Agla.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:14.570 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Agla is a magical
formula or power

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:84%
word from the Western
Mystery School

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:23.780 align:middle line:84%
tradition that has roots in the
ancient teachings of Kabbalah.

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to
a phrase called

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Atah Gibor Le-olam Adonai, which
means thou art mighty forever,

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.930 align:middle line:90%
Lord.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:36.560 align:middle line:84%
So the A-G-L-A are the first
letters of each of these words

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.110 align:middle line:90%
in the Hebrew tradition.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Now speak or whisper
out loud your intent

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:47.600 align:middle line:84%
for your divine
potential to be awakened.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Finally, send this energy
into your space, your life.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Share it with the people
you interact with.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And let that light of
awakening flow and grow.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Use this method every
day for 40 days.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And you will be amazed
at what happens.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.520 align:middle line:84%

we discover more

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:09.410 align:middle line:84%

science of ascension

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.700 align:middle line:84%
and achieving our
full potential.
