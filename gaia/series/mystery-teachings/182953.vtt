00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:10%
How do we break out of the
box of our old paradigm

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.990 align:middle line:10%
and move beyond limited and
linear ways of operating?

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.960 align:middle line:84%
A new paradigm of
quantum, holographic,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and multi-dimensional thinking
offers an alternative model

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.450 align:middle line:90%
to our past.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
But to make this shift, we must
reassess the very framework

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.960 align:middle line:84%
we use to organize and orient
ourselves within spacetime.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.470 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we explore
very practical tools

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.410 align:middle line:84%
for shifting our framework
and tapping into a more

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.828 align:middle line:90%
expansive flow of life.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
The pursuit of
structure has been

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
a central endeavor for
humans since the earliest

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.475 align:middle line:90%
civilizations.

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this pursuit, man has
devised various grid systems

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
as a way to organize and define
our reality within spacetime.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.830 align:middle line:90%
Grids are based upon geometry.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.825 align:middle line:84%
This makes geometry
and the mathematics

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:21.480 align:middle line:84%
that underlies it one
of the oldest arts

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:90%
and sciences on the planet.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
For much of human
history, the keys

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to applying this art and science
were kept as trade secrets

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.250 align:middle line:90%
that only the few had access to.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.590 align:middle line:84%
These keys were used
for everything from city

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.190 align:middle line:84%
planning to the designs
of temples and buildings,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:90%
to book formats and typography.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Even to this day, it
shows up in the way

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
we are presented with images
on our digital devices.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Grids form the very foundation
upon which all precision design

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:90%
work is based.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.230 align:middle line:84%
In our modern world, the
most common grid system

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.320 align:middle line:84%
is based upon the
geometry of the square.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Pick up any notebook with grid
paper from an office supply

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.180 align:middle line:84%
store and you'll
see the pages are

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
lined with vertical and
horizontal lines that

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.870 align:middle line:84%
intersect to form rows and
columns of tiny squares.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:10%
This square-based grid
system forms the basis

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:10%
of what's called the Cartesian
coordinate system, where

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:10%
the length of a square is given
the value of one unit in space.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.430 align:middle line:84%
When we extend this grid system
to three dimensions of space,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
we get the familiar
axes of x, y, and z.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:84%
This system works with
the numbers 0 through 9

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.120 align:middle line:84%
and higher, with each
number in the sequence

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
being one unit greater
than the previous number.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:84%
This sequential counting
system, based on the box or unit

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
square, has governed the
way in which we order,

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and therefore
perceive, our reality.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
For several centuries, this
has been the dominant framework

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:84%
for organizing the
world around us.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The Cartesian coordinate system
played a fundamental role

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
in the development of
calculus by Isaac Newton

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:90%
and Gottfried Leibniz.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.980 align:middle line:84%
It flourished in
the Newtonian era,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and underlies so much
of science that it still

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:90%
affects our worldview today.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:84%
This system is
great for reducing

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:84%
a whole into its
separate parts in order

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%
to have things in boxes.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But as we shift into
a quantum paradigm,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:90%
we must break out of the box.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.220 align:middle line:10%
From a quantum
perspective, the limits

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.960 align:middle line:10%
of the Cartesian
coordinate system

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:10%
become painfully obvious.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:10%
Physicist David Bohm identifies
the Cartesian coordinate system

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:10%
as one of the biggest
problems with current physics.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.470 align:middle line:84%
He acknowledges
it as a good model

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to understand separate parts
in a linear way of thinking,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.960 align:middle line:84%
but it fails at understanding
the undivided whole.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Bohm writes that
"Aristotle would

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.190 align:middle line:84%
have found the coordinate
system of little

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
or no significance for
his aim of understanding

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.400 align:middle line:90%
the universe as an organism.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:84%
But once men were
ready to conceive

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
of the universe
as a machine, they

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
would naturally tend to take
the order of coordinates

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
as a universally relevant
one, valid for all basic

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:90%
descriptions in physics.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
Thus we have inherited this
Cartesian coordinate system

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
from an age of
mechanistic worldview."

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.180 align:middle line:84%
The Cartesian model is very
linear, and as a result,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:84%
it puts us and our
entire way of orienting

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.020 align:middle line:90%
our thoughts into a box.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:84%
It limits our ability
to think holographically

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:90%
and to see the whole organism.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Bohm criticizes this
existing framework

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
which has dominated
science and mathematics

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.890 align:middle line:90%
since the time of Descartes.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.000 align:middle line:10%
He asserts that physical
law should refer primarily

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.200 align:middle line:10%
to an order of undivided
wholeness, similar to that

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.960 align:middle line:10%
indicated by the
hologram, rather

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:10%
than to an order of analysis
into separate parts.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
This limiting model is
more about static systems

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
than our living,
dynamic, organic,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.340 align:middle line:90%
and interconnected reality.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:10%
Beyond mathematics and
science, this numbering system

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:10%
is how we have learned
to order and understand

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.500 align:middle line:10%
the universe around us.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:84%
It is the relationship
between humans and spacetime,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and this perspective is
deeply embedded within us.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Bohm indicates the
pervasiveness of this system

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
by noting that, while
physics has changed radically

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:84%
in many ways, the
Cartesian grid has

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.910 align:middle line:84%
remained one of the key
features that has not changed.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:84%
He explains that our notions
of order are pervasive.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
For not only do they involve our
thinking, but also our senses,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
our feelings, our intuitions,
our movement in physical space,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.290 align:middle line:84%
our relationships with other
people and with society

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
as a whole, and indeed
every phase of our lives.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
How far back can we trace
this Cartesian-type grid

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.250 align:middle line:90%
or numbering system?

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, it actually
goes as far back

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.380 align:middle line:84%
as the Pythagorean
numerology model.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras was an initiate
of the Western Mystery School

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:10%
tradition.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:10%
And while there is true magic
that comes from the Pythagorean

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:10%
model, his mathematical
conclusions

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:10%
have inadvertently limited us.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.430 align:middle line:84%
By today, it is so
ingrained within our society

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:90%
we don't even think about it.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Some aspects of the Pythagorean
model are really good.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But the use of the numbers 0
through 9 as a counting system

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.730 align:middle line:84%
is where it keeps us stuck
in a limited way of being.

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.380 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we count 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
6, 7, 8, 9, every
time we hit 9, it's

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
an ending, a death,
or a completion.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
The Pythagorean number system
is thus a system of endings.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
When we count using
this number system,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:84%
it's like constantly
reinforcing a death march.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Counting 1 through 9 is like
following marching orders.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
It's very ordered
and militaristic.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:84%
It's a good way to control
people and keep them

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.820 align:middle line:90%
within a set of rules or boxes.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Now before we go
too far with this,

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.130 align:middle line:84%
let me just be clear that
the numbers 0 through 9

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:90%
are important as archetypes.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:10%
They are on the tree of life.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:10%
They are emanations
from the source,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:10%
representing states of being
or aspects of divinity.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Each number stands on its
own as an archetype or ray

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.990 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:84%
They were never meant to be
used as a counting system.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
When we adopted this
system for counting,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.210 align:middle line:84%
we put ourselves in a position
of counting in a linear way--

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
step 1, step 2, step
3, step 4, and so on.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And this led to limitations in
so many other aspects of life.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
The Pythagorean number system
dictates a certain rhythm

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.130 align:middle line:84%
or frequency that is cut
off from our true reality.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.530 align:middle line:10%
It leads to a
reductionist model,

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:10%
looking at separate parts
outside of their relation

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:10%
to the whole.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It limits our
connection to spirit

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.420 align:middle line:90%
within our physical life.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel
cut off from spirit.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:84%
We wonder why is spirit not
more alive in our physical life.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, part of the
problem is that we've

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
been relying on this
number system for counting,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and we have attuned ourselves
to its limiting frequency.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:84%
While science and mathematics
have readily adopted it,

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
the Mystery School
tradition has been

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
asking, what if we never
adopted the 1-through-9 counting

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.140 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Would we perhaps not have built
boxes all over the planet?

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Would our modern-day
homes and structures

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.490 align:middle line:84%
maybe have been more
like domes or pyramids?

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the Mystery
School, we see today

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.110 align:middle line:84%
that the Pythagorean
number system slowly

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
eliminated the
possibilities of magic

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.130 align:middle line:90%
within this physical materia.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything has become too
linear and structured,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
according to the box, for
real magic to take place.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.420 align:middle line:84%
It has formed our
matrix, and now we

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:84%
need to get out of this
matrix and into Zion

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
in order to tap back in
to the real magic of life.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And there is no reason other
than old paradigm conventions

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
that we should be bound
by this Cartesian grid

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:90%
or Pythagorean counting system.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:90%
These systems are not absolutes.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Any grid system or
number system should

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.060 align:middle line:84%
be flexible to meet the needs
and the purposes at hand,

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and if necessary, can
be modified or even

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.610 align:middle line:84%
abandoned if we have
a better solution.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:06.518 align:middle line:84%
Purpose defines form, and
form reveals function.

00:10:06.518 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Functionality is the main
feature of any grid system.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It is simply a way of
organizing information.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
What alternative number
systems could we use?

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Is there another
framework that fits more

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.970 align:middle line:90%
within a quantum worldview?

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
The answer is yes, there are
actually a couple options

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:90%
we can look at.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
One alternative to
the Pythagorean model

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.030 align:middle line:84%
is the chaldean
numerology system.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:35.540 align:middle line:84%
The chaldean system traces
back to the Sumerians.

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.150 align:middle line:10%
The Sumerians used
numbers 0 through 9,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:10%
but in their counting system,
they only used 1 through 8.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
While this system works with
incremental units still,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
the advantage to an
eight-count system

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:90%
is that it's more musical.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It is much more according
to the rhythm of the soul,

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.530 align:middle line:90%
the rhythm of life.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
When we count 0 through 9, we
notice the energy drops at 9,

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.490 align:middle line:84%
and then we need to put effort
in to start it up again.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we use the
eight-count system,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
we don't have that
same kind of drop.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.360 align:middle line:84%
There is a continuation,
a connectedness, a flow,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and so many dance
styles are based

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:90%
on this eight-count rhythm.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
We see this counting system and
things like the octagon, the I

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Ching, the bagua, which is the
continuation of all things.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
We also see it in the
three-dimensional Tree of Life

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
when the structure of the
three-dimensional tree

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:84%
forms an octagon as
it rotates around us.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.140 align:middle line:84%
When we tune our life to this
chaldean numerology system,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
it is more rhythmic
and uplifting.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Life becomes a dance rather
than a march or a task.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:90%
It is the rhythm of the soul.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the chaldean system
brings more energy,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:90%
more harmony into our lives.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
But there is another system
to explore with even more

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.450 align:middle line:84%
potential for us as
spiritual beings living

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.380 align:middle line:84%
in the physical world, one
that can really get us out

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:90%
of the box.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what is known as
a Vitruvian numerology.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
How is Vitruvian
mathematics so different?

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's based on
acceleration and expansion.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.140 align:middle line:84%
It is about living life fully
alive, taking leaps in life.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the rhythm that we
should be flowing in our lives.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.560 align:middle line:84%
It is in accordance
with our spirit enters

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.230 align:middle line:90%
into this physical plane.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:10%
Rather than a
linear progression,

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.890 align:middle line:10%
Vitruvian numerology is based
on the Fibonacci sequence, which

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:10%
is an ever-expanding
progression.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:10%
It gives us the frequency
of the golden mean,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:10%
the measure of spirit
entering into the physical.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
As the rays of Ein
Sof, the source,

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
penetrate into the physical
density of materia,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.440 align:middle line:84%
it generates this golden
ratio of 1.618, dot dot dot.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
"The Vitruvian Man,"
by Leonardo da Vinci,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.530 align:middle line:84%
another Western Mystery
School initiate,

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.800 align:middle line:84%
illustrates these proportions
within the human body,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
with each segment of the
fingers, to the hand,

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
to the arm, and so on,
all of it expanding

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:90%
according to this golden ratio.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.990 align:middle line:84%
In "The Vitruvian Man," da Vinci
shows two different worlds,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.660 align:middle line:90%
the box and the circle.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Also hidden within
it is the triangle.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
It makes one wonder
whether da Vinci was

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.860 align:middle line:84%
encouraging us to look
at the potential we lost.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Have we become stuck in a box?

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.080 align:middle line:84%
How do we break out
of the box and get

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.900 align:middle line:84%
into the true cycle
and rhythm of life

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:90%
represented by the circle?

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And he seems to
indicate that doing so

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
requires that we
spread our wings

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and connect to our spirit, which
is represented by the hidden

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:90%
triangles.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.800 align:middle line:10%
Vinci was obviously
paying homage

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:10%
to Vitruvius in how
he named this artwork.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.720 align:middle line:10%
Vitruvius was known to
have said that "the height

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:10%
of a well-proportioned
man is equal to the span

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:10%
of his outstretched arms.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
These two equal
measures yield a square,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:84%
which encompasses
the whole body,

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
while the hands and feet
touch a circle centered

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.860 align:middle line:90%
upon the navel."

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Now who was Vitruvius?

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.410 align:middle line:84%
He was a Roman
mathematician and architect

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
living in the first century BC,
just before the time of Christ.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.810 align:middle line:10%
Some of the earliest
surviving written records

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:10%
of architectural art and
science come from Vitruvius.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:10%
He championed the idea that
the architecture of a temple

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.150 align:middle line:10%
should be based on the likeness
of the perfectly-proportioned

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:52.050 align:middle line:10%
human body, where a harmony
exists among its many parts.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, Vitruvius was also an
initiate of the Western Mystery

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:84%
School tradition, who very
likely traveled to Alexandria

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to investigate the temples
and pyramids of Egypt,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and to study at the great
libraries of Alexandria.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Vitruvius was trying to figure
out how to reach the infinite.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.430 align:middle line:84%
He worked with the Fibonacci
sequence and the golden mean,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and he brought this
into his architecture.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Vitruvius didn't
invent this, obviously,

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:84%
but he popularized
it in the West.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:10%
From the time of Christ
onwards, the use of golden ratio

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.820 align:middle line:10%
is now found in most temples
designed by Western initiates.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:10%
We can trace it all the
way back to ancient Egypt,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:10%
as well as to one of Solomon's
temples in Alexandria,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.120 align:middle line:10%
and then later the
Sistine Chapel as well

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:10%
as various Masonic
and Christian temples.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.450 align:middle line:84%
They're all working with
this golden mean energy.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And with that,
they're more alive,

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.830 align:middle line:84%
like resonant
chambers of energy.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
What is the real meaning
behind the Fibonacci sequence,

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and Where does it come from?

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%
We know that it predates
mathematicians like Pythagoras,

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and Vitruvius, and Fibonacci.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.490 align:middle line:84%
This pattern has been
with us from the beginning

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:84%
it is the information that
contains the program upon which

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.620 align:middle line:84%
life is built. The
ancient Egyptians

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
called the golden ratio,
the divine essence.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.990 align:middle line:84%
It is a measure
of the light that

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
comes to this density from
source and becomes materia.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:84%
This number, 1.618, is
found all throughout nature,

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and is all around
us and within us.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Kabbalistic
terms, we say

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.050 align:middle line:84%
that Ein Sof, the
source of all things,

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:90%
first sent out a singular ray.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.970 align:middle line:90%
This created a point.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a center
point for creation.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:90%
But no form is yet created.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:84%
First, this reference
point was needed.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:84%
Then, two reference
points formed

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.400 align:middle line:84%
a line, which then sets a
direction like a vector.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.320 align:middle line:84%
Then a third reference
point is needed

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
to create the first form,
which is the triangle.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.740 align:middle line:84%
This first form, the
triangle, is then

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.050 align:middle line:84%
reflected down through
multiple densities

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:90%
to create the tree of life.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.460 align:middle line:84%
We can also think of the tree
of life as 10 rays of light.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
From the one came 10,
like the 10 fingers

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.770 align:middle line:84%
of Ein Sof spreading
out into the universe.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Those 10 raised of light happen
to be in exact golden ratio

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:84%
to each other, which we now
know of as the 1.618 phi ration.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:39.110 align:middle line:84%
This ratio of 1.618 can even
be found within our DNA.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.220 align:middle line:84%
When we take the ratio
of the length and width

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
of a single DNA
twist, each full cycle

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
of a double-helix
spiral in our DNA

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:53.380 align:middle line:84%
is 34 Angstroms long
by 21 Angstroms wide.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Both these numbers are found
in the Fibonacci sequence,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
and their ratio is approximately
the golden or phi ratio.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
It is also the measurement of
the spiral path of our galaxy,

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and many forms in nature grow
according to this golden ratio

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:90%
or Fibonacci sequence.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Through the art and science of
working with Fibonacci numbers,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.150 align:middle line:90%
we can transform our own DNA.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
The golden spiral is the
growth pattern of life.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
It is the sequence of
multiplication, replication,

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.710 align:middle line:90%
and expansion.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
It brings life,
growth, abundance.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:90%
It is a pattern of progression.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
It shows us how energy
is meant to flow.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Nature reveals it to
us in so many ways.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And as scientists
and alchemists,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:50.530 align:middle line:84%
we pay attention to nature when
we ask, what are nature's laws,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:90%
and what is it revealing to us?

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Ancient initiates,
mathematicians, artists,

00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and scientists all paid
attention to these things.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:10%
da Vinci embedded the Fibonacci
sequence and golden ratio

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.420 align:middle line:10%
throughout the
Vitruvian Man design,

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:10%
as well as other art
and design work he did.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.900 align:middle line:84%
He saw this mathematical
formula of the golden mean

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:90%
as a divine blueprint.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.270 align:middle line:84%
This pure blueprint vibrates
in the Fibonacci sequence

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and create something perfect,
the perfected being, the Adam

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:84%
Kadmon, which is what
this Vitruvian Man really

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.410 align:middle line:90%
represents.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
In our present human
form, we're not there yet.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.970 align:middle line:90%
We are imperfect.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
This is because we are currently
off-tune from that frequency.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But we are learning to get
back to that perfection,

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:84%
and that is what da Vinci is
teaching us through his art.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.350 align:middle line:84%
This is a key for us to
re-attune ourselves back

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.820 align:middle line:84%
into harmony with the golden
ratio and Fibonacci numbers.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:90%
We are the key.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:90%
We are the Vitruvian Man.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:90%
We are the pentagram.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Notice how the pentagram is made
up of triangles, all of which

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.520 align:middle line:90%
are in golden ratio.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.720 align:middle line:84%
This is a highly revered symbol
in the Western Mystery School

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
tradition because of this
golden ratio all over it.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It fits perfectly
within a pentagon,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:84%
and the faces of
the dodecahedron

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:90%
form of the platonic solids.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.630 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the hidden
reasons why the symbol is

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:90%
considered as so divine.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
The pentagram is the
symbol of man, of humans.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci
shows this, beginning

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
with the man
standing in the box,

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
and then expanding to
the pentagram form.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And in this movement, he
breaks out of the box,

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.830 align:middle line:90%
into the circle.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But what is being
revealed is the triangle,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
the hidden triangles
between his legs and arms.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.970 align:middle line:84%
These triangles highlight
the golden ratio again.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a hidden
secret of this art,

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and it is revealing
that we are the key.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.780 align:middle line:84%
We have the golden
ratio all over our body,

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:84%
from the tip of the fingers, to
the proportion of each joint,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.710 align:middle line:84%
to the knuckle, the wrist,
the elbow, the shoulder.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Nature is showing us
that this is our rhythm.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.270 align:middle line:84%
It is the rhythm of life,
the rhythm of growth.

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Nature grows according to
these sequences and ratios.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
This golden ratio
is life-enhancing.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:84%
How can we use Vitruvian
numerology and mathematics

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:90%
in our daily lives?

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.980 align:middle line:90%
The golden ratio is who we are.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.840 align:middle line:90%
This sequence is us.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But we are currently
living under

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:44.180 align:middle line:84%
a different societal system,
one that puts us in a box.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:84%
And the box isn't always bad,
but it does create limitation,

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.740 align:middle line:90%
and it can get boring.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Now if we want to continue
to grow and evolve,

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:84%
we have to break out
of the box, meaning

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.430 align:middle line:84%
we have to get out
of the comfort zone.

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The Vitruvian system gives
us this organic framework

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:06.400 align:middle line:90%
to move beyond our limitations.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
We can use it to change some
of our mathematical approach

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.800 align:middle line:84%
to understanding the
undivided wholeness,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
holographic universe.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Rather than a limited
and linear logic,

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
we can tap into an
expansive and dynamic flow.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.070 align:middle line:84%
There is still a
logic to it, but it

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:90%
is a different kind of logic.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Vitruvian mathematics is
about expansion, acceleration,

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.830 align:middle line:84%
and growing to
limitless potential.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:39.930 align:middle line:84%
When we attune to this
new way of thinking,

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
instead of planning out our
path in incremental steps,

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.280 align:middle line:84%
such as step 1, step 2,
step 3, step 4, and so on,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.020 align:middle line:84%
we can instead think, how
do I take the next leap?

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.890 align:middle line:10%
In a Vitruvian way,
we start by taking

00:22:55.890 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:10%
one step, then another, then
two, then we begin leaping--

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:10%
3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
34, 55, and so on,

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:10%
with bigger and bigger leaps.

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
This puts us on an
accelerated path of evolution.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.310 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the basis for
a philosophy of life--

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
to always move beyond,
to take great strides

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:90%
and break barriers.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Through this
Vitruvian rhythm, we

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.890 align:middle line:84%
can make quantum leaps,
the kinds of leaps

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are being asked
to make all the time now

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.900 align:middle line:90%
in our fast-paced world.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
This is how we break free from
the overwhelm of today's pace

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.626 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:23:39.626 --> 00:23:42.420 align:middle line:10%
Now, some of the research
by Nassim Haramein and team

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:10%
demonstrated how the
golden ratio of 1.618

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:50.760 align:middle line:10%
truly governs the arrangements
of just about everything.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:84%
It includes a scaling
law relationship,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.530 align:middle line:84%
from the smallest
Planck scale up

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to the size of the
entire universe.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.560 align:middle line:84%
It might even be
fundamentally connected

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.490 align:middle line:84%
to the structure of the
vacuum of empty space.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Such a scaling law implies a
fractal or holographic template

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:17.010 align:middle line:84%
based on 1.618, within the
hologram's encoding level.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, decades earlier,
physicist David Bohm

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.600 align:middle line:10%
wrote, "if all actions are in
the form of discrete quanta,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.280 align:middle line:10%
the interactions between
different entities--"

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:31.320 align:middle line:10%
for example, electrons--
"constitute a single structure

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:35.370 align:middle line:10%
of indivisible links, so
that the entire universe has

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.740 align:middle line:10%
to be thought of as
an unbroken whole.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:10%
It is much more reminiscent of
how the organs of living being

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:50.070 align:middle line:10%
are related than it is of how
parts of a machine interact."

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:54.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
As the observer, when we
unfold this unbroken whole

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.350 align:middle line:84%
within everything we perceive
and the world around us,

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.270 align:middle line:84%
the true nature of our
reality is revealed.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:10.210 align:middle line:10%
It is built on
this framework, not

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:10%
of Cartesian squares or grids,
but on the golden ratio.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.830 align:middle line:84%
It is the frequency
of spirit entering

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:90%
into the physical plane.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Vitruvian numerology
recognizes the golden mean

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
reflected everywhere
around us and within us.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the framework we
should be basing our reality

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:32.980 align:middle line:90%
and societal structures upon.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.840 align:middle line:84%
The Cartesian
coordinate system was

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:84%
great for the era
of rationalism.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:84%
The scientific era
blossomed from it.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's no longer working
in the quantum era.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.640 align:middle line:84%
It was good for separation
and breaking things

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.090 align:middle line:84%
down into their parts,
but not for understanding

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
the dynamic movement
of the undivided whole.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.730 align:middle line:84%
We now need to leap, to
make a fundamental shift

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
in our paradigm, and this
leap requires an update

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.490 align:middle line:84%
to the very
framework that we use

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to orient ourselves within
spacetime and the flow of life.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
This framework is what we
use to order and make sense

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:90%
of our lives and the universe.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:90%
It has to change.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:84%
We cannot possibly make sense
of the undivided whole from

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.610 align:middle line:90%
a limited coordinate system.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Working with
Vitruvian numerology

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:84%
is not so much about the mind
and our old systems of logic,

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:90%
rather it's about the heart.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:84%
It's about taking leaps
in life, leaps of faith.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's about having
awareness of what's

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:42.480 align:middle line:84%
needed to be in the
Vitruvian rhythm

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.690 align:middle line:84%
instead of in the
Pythagorean rhythm.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.670 align:middle line:84%
The Pythagorean
rhythm can be used

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.120 align:middle line:84%
to bring order and
systematization,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.635 align:middle line:90%
but it isn't a way to live life.

00:26:55.635 --> 00:26:58.500 align:middle line:90%
But how do we make the shift?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are a
few practical methods

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.750 align:middle line:84%
we can use to begin to shift
ourselves into a Vitruvian

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.690 align:middle line:84%
rhythm, and live
life more fully alive

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and nurture our spirit
into the physical.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.960 align:middle line:84%
This requires us to
shift our frequency,

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:18.360 align:middle line:84%
to create a new resonance system
within, a resonance driver that

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.560 align:middle line:84%
can help us entrain and
maintain these golden vibrations

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.000 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves and our life.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.440 align:middle line:84%
What is meant by
a resonant system?

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.670 align:middle line:90%
This is really key.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.310 align:middle line:84%
In the physical world,
vibrational systems

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
generally experience some
kind of dampening effect.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, the friction
imposed by air molecules

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:43.140 align:middle line:84%
slows down and eventually
stops a pendulum from swinging.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.840 align:middle line:84%
To keep the pendulum
or swing going,

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.480 align:middle line:84%
there needs to be
a periodic push.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
When we establish
a resonance system,

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
this extra push at the
right time and amplitude

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.860 align:middle line:90%
keeps the flow going.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The rhythm of the
periodic push generates

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.620 align:middle line:90%
a resonance in the system.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:84%
How can we become active
players in the game of life,

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.970 align:middle line:84%
to start pushing ourselves
and the rest of humanity

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.150 align:middle line:90%
into this golden rhythm?

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
How can we shift from the dull
march of a Pythagorean rhythm

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:20.810 align:middle line:84%
into the Vitruvian rhythm
of living life alive.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.270 align:middle line:84%
One exercise to start
working with this

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.700 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from my
teacher, Gudni Gudnason,

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.590 align:middle line:84%
founder of the Modern
Mystery School,

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.560 align:middle line:84%
is to entrain our heart
into the Vitruvian rhythm

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.100 align:middle line:90%
through tapping.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.920 align:middle line:84%
To begin, breathe in and
out through the mouth only.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Continue breathing in this way.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And while breathing,
on the left wrist,

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
we're going to tap with our
right fingers in this way.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.060 align:middle line:84%
So continue breathing, and
then, first, hold the fingers

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:90%
on the wrist for 0.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:90%
Tap one time for 1.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:90%
Tap again for 1.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:90%
Tap twice for 2.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.695 align:middle line:84%
Tap three times, five
times, eight times.

00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:90%
13 times.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.620 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.620 align:middle line:84%
Now we hold our fingers on
our wrist for one minute,

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.210 align:middle line:90%
and time it.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Relax and breathe, now,
in through the nose,

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.970 align:middle line:90%
and out through the mouth.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Then repeat this
process several times.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in and out through
the mouth during this exercise

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:84%
increases our heart rate and
it imprints the new rhythm

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:34.960 align:middle line:90%
into our being.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.100 align:middle line:84%
This process is changing the way
our heart operates, imprinting

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:90%
the Vitruvian rhythm.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.420 align:middle line:84%
If we want to align
with this rhythm,

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.450 align:middle line:84%
we won't get anywhere by
trying to just analyze it.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.240 align:middle line:90%
We need to just live it.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.490 align:middle line:84%
One other practical method is to
identify our Vitruvian number.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a personal
number to shift us

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.040 align:middle line:90%
into the Vitruvian rhythm.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.070 align:middle line:84%
We're working with the
frequency of the physical body,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
the electrical impulses, the
flow of energy within us.

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:11.050 align:middle line:10%
The frequency of our brain at
a delta level, for example,

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.690 align:middle line:10%
is 0 to 3 hertz or
beats per second.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.970 align:middle line:10%
This is a deep sleep or
almost coma-like state.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.000 align:middle line:10%
The theta level operates
from 3 to 8 hertz,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.850 align:middle line:10%
which is a transition
between sleep

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:10%
or deep meditation,
or a dreamlike state.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.860 align:middle line:10%
The alpha level operates
at 8 to 13 hertz.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.790 align:middle line:10%
This is a restful yet
inwardly-awake state.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.590 align:middle line:10%
While the beta level
operates from 13 to 34 hertz,

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.370 align:middle line:10%
which is when we are fully
awake and outwardly focused.

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Notice that each of
these transition points

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:84%
are within the
Fibonacci sequence--

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:56.350 align:middle line:84%
0 to 3 for delta, 3 to 8 for
theta, 8 to 13 for alpha,

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.600 align:middle line:84%
and even that 5
hertz is considered

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.370 align:middle line:84%
a benchmark between low
alpha and high alpha.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.530 align:middle line:10%
A beta brainwave state
represents that fully

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:10%
awake state.

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:10%
We shift into beta, we're
awake and aware at 13 hertz.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So in Vitruvian
numerology, we then

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.000 align:middle line:84%
ask, what do we need to
become fully awakened?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.020 align:middle line:84%
We use this number, 13, as
a number that represents

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.840 align:middle line:90%
the shift into awakening.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.450 align:middle line:84%
We begin by using
Pythagorean numerology

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.340 align:middle line:84%
to identify our personal
number using our name.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:37.390 align:middle line:84%
This is done by identifying the
number of our full birth name,

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:84%
based on the Pythagorean
numerology chart, which

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.610 align:middle line:84%
much of our Western
system is based

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:84%
upon, and reduce this down to a
number, then, between 1 and 9.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So we get our full name and
every number, we add it all up,

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and then reduce to a
number between 1 and 9.

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
My personal Pythagorean
number happens to be a 7.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.660 align:middle line:84%
So to get my Vitruvian
number, I then

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:84%
look at how many steps
from that 7 to get

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.950 align:middle line:90%
to 13, the number of awakening.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So to get that, we take the
difference between the number

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:90%
of our name and 13.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.650 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it comes
to 13 minus 7,

00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:20.800 align:middle line:84%
which equals 6, making my
personal Vitruvian number 6.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, instead of focusing on
the meaning of the number,

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the real question
is, what do we need

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.610 align:middle line:84%
to do to bring that Vitruvian
number into our life?

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.620 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps that can be
something like taking

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.180 align:middle line:84%
that number of steps or leaps
to start our day every day,

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:84%
or doing things in sets
of our Vitruvian number,

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:46.530 align:middle line:84%
to attune or evoke this shift
from our base number up to 13

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:84%
every day of our life, to
shift into this Fibonacci

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.835 align:middle line:90%
number of awakening.

00:32:51.835 --> 00:32:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Our Vitruvian number will
be different for each of us

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:90%
based on our full birth name.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Again, we don't need to analyze
the meaning of this number.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Just bring this number into our
life in as many wins as we can.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.430 align:middle line:84%
As more of us take
an active role

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.920 align:middle line:84%
in making this shift
intentionally for ourselves,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.960 align:middle line:84%
we will gradually contribute to
creating a collective effect.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.020 align:middle line:84%
When we attune to
the Fibonacci rhythm,

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:23.410 align:middle line:84%
those incremental
adjustments will add up.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:84%
We become the resonant
drivers to shift the frequency

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:30.820 align:middle line:84%
within the whole framework
of our human collective.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.770 align:middle line:90%
This is our natural frequency.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.550 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to be living
the frequency of our spirit.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:84%
We've just forgotten how
to be in tune with it.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%
Now we have some
tools and knowledge

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:90%
to help us get back in tune.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.710 align:middle line:84%
As we've worked with this
new system or framework based

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
on Vitruvian numerology
and the golden ratio,

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.210 align:middle line:84%
we see that there are many
ways we can apply this.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:57.730 align:middle line:84%
It is a paradigm shift in
how we relate and organize

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.560 align:middle line:90%
the world around us.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Transitioning into
a new structure

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:84%
they can help us
move beyond the box

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.040 align:middle line:84%
into a more life-affirming,
evolutionary numerology system,

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:84%
one that fits with a
quantum world view.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:15.880 align:middle line:84%
We want to keep moving,
never staying the same.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the spice of
life, is to keep moving.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Let the rhythm of your
soul move your body

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.949 align:middle line:90%
to the beat of the universe.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:28.820 align:middle line:84%
This is how we grow,
evolve and progress.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.880 align:middle line:90%
This is a key to move beyond.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.969 align:middle line:84%
And to get there,
we have to leap.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:37.030 align:middle line:84%
We must take risks in
life, try new things,

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:41.179 align:middle line:84%
be spontaneous, live without
regrets, have passion in life,

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.540 align:middle line:90%
and follow our passion.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.350 align:middle line:84%
As we move, we're
moving creation itself.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.469 align:middle line:84%
Through this movement, we can
master ourselves and the world

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:54.790 align:middle line:84%
around us to evolve and
take it to the next level.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Working with this golden
ratio, we shift and grow.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:90%
It is our formula for growth.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.190 align:middle line:84%
The new paradigm is
here, but it's up to us

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.170 align:middle line:90%
to start living it.

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Find whatever creative way we
can to apply this in our life.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Have awareness of
Vitruvian numerology

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:15.730 align:middle line:84%
at a practical level, and
work with it every day.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Make a shift personally
to take leaps in life

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.470 align:middle line:84%
rather than staying
stuck in a box.

00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.330 align:middle line:84%
When we are flowing
this golden ratio,

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
we are not walking
a straight line.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It is not a linear grid
system that keeps us in a box.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.140 align:middle line:84%
We are instead tapping into
the key for how everything

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:90%
grows, multiplies, evolves.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.140 align:middle line:90%
It opens up unlimited potential.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Work with Fibonacci
numbers and start living

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:47.290 align:middle line:90%
this pattern and map every day.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:84%
We can adjust, at a
very practical level,

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:53.800 align:middle line:84%
the frequencies of our lives,
our communities, our world.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Doing so creates a
new rhythmic driver,

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.470 align:middle line:84%
like we did with the
tapping on our pulse

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.530 align:middle line:84%
to entrain the heart
into a new resonance.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:06.410 align:middle line:84%
The little things we
do can and do matter,

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:84%
especially when there are many
of us doing those little things

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:14.890 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis to attune to
that life-enhancing frequency.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Let the numerology
bring you to life.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:90%
Listen to life.

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Take leaps.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.920 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we discover
more practical tools

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.820 align:middle line:84%
for expanding our
awareness and perceptions.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:34.420 align:middle line:84%
of our human potential with
me in this episode of "Mystery

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.320 align:middle line:90%
