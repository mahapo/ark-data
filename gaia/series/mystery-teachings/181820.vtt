What is the significance
of the number three?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Why does it show up so
much, both in physics

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.470 align:middle line:10%
and spirituality?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.930 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
explore the power of three,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:10%
its meaning, and importance in
making us who and what we are.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:10%
Nikola Tesla once
claimed, "If you only

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.810 align:middle line:10%
knew the magnificence
of the 3, 6, and 9,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.480 align:middle line:10%
then you would have the
keys to the universe."

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Each of these numbers,
three, six, and nine,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
are perfectly
divisible by three.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Tesla truly believed
in the power of 3,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
as evidenced by his life.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.750 align:middle line:84%
For example, he was known
to repeat everything

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:90%
in sets of three.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And he would only stay in hotel
rooms with a number divisible

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:90%
by three.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Was Tesla just being
superstitious or OCD,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:84%
or could he have been
purposefully tuning himself

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.260 align:middle line:84%
in to the power of
three for good reason?

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.240 align:middle line:84%
The number three
is considered very

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.670 align:middle line:84%
sacred by spiritual traditions
throughout the world.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is seen as the holy
trinity, or the supernal triad,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.920 align:middle line:84%
or the archetypes of
father, mother, child,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.590 align:middle line:84%
or the sacred geometry
of the triangle,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
the importance of
three is universal.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it spiritually
significant, the power of three

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
appears in science
again and again.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:84%
It relates to some of the most
important unanswered questions

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
in modern physics,
such as, why do

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.850 align:middle line:84%
we live in three
dimensions of space?

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And why are there
particles of matter

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
grouped into three generations
in the standard model?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.215 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore these
a bit more closely.

00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
There's an
interesting phenomenon

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that occurs with
particles of matter.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Each particle seems to come in
three versions or generations

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.509 align:middle line:90%
of itself.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Each version has the same
charge, the same interactions

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.110 align:middle line:84%
with the strong, weak, and
electromagnetic forces.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
that distinguishes them

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
is their mass.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
For example, the other
versions of the electron

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:84%
are the muon and
the tau particles.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, there are three types
of corresponding neutrinos.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
Altogether, these form what
are called the six leptons.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Then there are also
six quarks that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.602 align:middle line:84%
are grouped into
three generations,

00:02:36.602 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:84%
with the quarks
that are called up,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
charm, and top being one set
and then the other three quarks,

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:84%
called down,
strange, and bottom,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.830 align:middle line:90%
comprising the other set.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Altogether, these six
quarks and six leptons

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
are called the 12 fermions
that make up ordinary matter.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Again, the only real difference
in the three generations

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.610 align:middle line:84%
of particles in a
particular set is the mass,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.880 align:middle line:84%
which is determined
by its interactions

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:90%
with the Higgs field.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
But that mass difference can be
quite large from one generation

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.790 align:middle line:90%
to the next.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And the larger the
mass, the more energy it

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
takes to generate and
sustain that particle,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:90%
thus, the less stable it is.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
In our universe
today, we primarily

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
find the lowest mass
generation of particles.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.110 align:middle line:84%
The heavier particles are
only created in high energy

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
collisions, like those found
in particle accelerators,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.720 align:middle line:84%
or due to cosmic
rays, or perhaps

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.460 align:middle line:90%
during the time of the Big Bang.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.950 align:middle line:84%
But these heavier
particles very quickly

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:84%
decay into their
lighter generations.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
For example, the heavier quarks
generated in particle colliders

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
will decay into the
up and down quarks.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.555 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is all this important?

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, in physics
today, they call

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
this process of particle decay a
flavor change or transmutation.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.430 align:middle line:84%
When we hear the word
transmutation or even change,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:90%
we should think of alchemy.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is a natural process
that all things undergo

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
in order to transform
and transmute

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
from an unstable state to a more
stable or incorruptible state.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
Here we are seeing alchemy at
work in the subatomic quantum

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.490 align:middle line:84%
We might reflect upon
where we are out of balance

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.830 align:middle line:90%
or unstable in our lives.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And what can we do to
alchemically transmute

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:84%
those areas and bring
greater balance?

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
With that also
comes the question,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:84%
what do we need to let
decay or die in our lives

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
or in our thoughts in order to
allow the alchemy to progress?

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.360 align:middle line:84%
If we look at our
society today, there

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:90%
are many things out of balance.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Those things are created by
humans who are out of balance.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:90%
As humans, we are all connected.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:90%
We all share a collective mind.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
So those imbalances
that we see in society

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.550 align:middle line:90%
are also in each of us.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing we can
really change is ourselves.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.350 align:middle line:10%
When we see the
world as our mirror

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:10%
and we take ownership of
what it is reflecting to us,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.550 align:middle line:10%
that is when we can
start making new choices

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:10%
and taking new actions to
transform and transmute

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.835 align:middle line:10%
from the inner to the outer to
bring balance and stability.

00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:31.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we know
if we are progressing

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:90%
in the alchemical process?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the beautiful
things about alchemy.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
It gives us a clear roadmap
to the stages of progression.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, alchemy
talks about three phases.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:84%
This power of three shows
up a lot in alchemy.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:10%
And these three
phases are called

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.980 align:middle line:10%
by the Latin terms nigredo,
albedo, and rubedo, which

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.000 align:middle line:10%
refer to colors--

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.080 align:middle line:10%
namely, the black phase, the
white phase, and the red phase.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:10%
In the black phase of
nigredo, it relates to a time

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.030 align:middle line:10%
when we experience
maybe a dark night

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.820 align:middle line:10%
of the soul or,
alternatively, a time

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.330 align:middle line:10%
of needing to root out
impurities and imbalances.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Then the white phase
of albedo is a time

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:84%
of purification and raising
vibration to connect to spirit

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
and then bringing that
higher energy back

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:90%
to be embodied in the physical.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, the
red phase of rubedo

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
is when we crystallize
or solidify

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
into a more complete,
integrated, and balanced form.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Just like a heavy
quark or lepton decays

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:84%
from an unstable state
to an intermediate state

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.010 align:middle line:84%
and then to a
final stable state,

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
we too are meant to transform
and transmute from nigredo

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:90%
to albedo to rubedo.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is a cyclic
process, meaning

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.580 align:middle line:84%
we don't just do it
once, but many times

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in different aspects
of our lives,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
until we eventually become more
whole, awakened, empowered,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.590 align:middle line:90%
and fully realized humans.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:84%
There is a science to
the alchemical process,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:90%
and there is also an art.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:10.830 align:middle line:84%
The art is in how we, as active
participants, learn to harness,

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.280 align:middle line:84%
express, and work with
the laws of nature

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to accelerate the
transformational cycles.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Examples of these laws of
nature that we can harness

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
are the seven
hermetic principles.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:10%
One of those
principles that really

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:10%
applies to the power of three
is the principle of rhythm.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.530 align:middle line:90%
What is the principle of rhythm?

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it says, "Everything
flows, in and out.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Everything has its tides.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:90%
All things rise and fall.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
The pendulum swing manifests
itself in everything.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The measure of the
swing to the right

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the measure
of the swing to the left.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Rhythm compensates."

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.790 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
things are constantly

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:84%
oscillating between two poles,
and somewhere in the middle

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:90%
is the balance point.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.370 align:middle line:84%
This principle of rhythm
shows up in everything,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
from the macrocosm to the
microcosm, and in all realms,

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
whether they be of
mind, matter, or energy.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, in quantum
physics, one way we

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:84%
see this principle
of rhythm show up

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.300 align:middle line:90%
is in the behavior of neutrinos.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.510 align:middle line:84%
As we saw before, there are
three types or generations

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:26.780 align:middle line:90%
of neutrinos.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
But unlike the other particles
of the standard model,

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.049 align:middle line:84%
neutrinos are very
light in mass,

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:37.370 align:middle line:84%
at least 500,000 times
lighter than an electron.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And they only interact very
weakly with other particles.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the mass differences
between each type of neutrino

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:90%
are also very tiny.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.160 align:middle line:84%
If they had no mass at all, then
all these types of neutrinos

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:90%
would be physically identical.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And since their
masses are so small,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:84%
they don't decay like
heavier particles.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
However, that little
bit of mass difference

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.840 align:middle line:84%
allows neutrinos to
transform in another way.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.140 align:middle line:84%
They go through what are
called neutrino oscillations.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does that mean?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that
any single neutrino

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
is a quantum superposition
of all three types.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
As it travels
through space-time,

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.850 align:middle line:84%
it oscillates from
one type to another.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Rather than a single
pendulum swinging,

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.150 align:middle line:84%
we can imagine a neutrino
as three pendulums coupled

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
together, each with
slightly different mass.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Because of their
mass difference,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:84%
each pendulum swings at
slightly different rates.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:84%
This results in a periodic
transformation process,

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.250 align:middle line:84%
where a neutrino might start
out as an electron neutrino.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
Then as it travels,
it will become

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:90%
a mixture of all three types.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.450 align:middle line:10%
And at some distant
point, if an observer

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:10%
were to measure which
type of neutrino it is,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:10%
they might get an electron
type, a muon type,

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:10%
or a tau type of neutrino.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:84%
As a personal aside, this is
one of the research projects

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.900 align:middle line:84%
I worked on for several
years during my PhD studies

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:90%
in physics.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.810 align:middle line:84%
At the time,
astrophysicists were

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand the sun
and the particles it generated.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.500 align:middle line:84%
Some of the particles
predicted by the solar model

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.850 align:middle line:90%
were electron type neutrinos.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
But up to that point,
all neutrino detectors

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:84%
were only observing one third to
half as many electron neutrinos

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:90%
as predicted by the solar model.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:10%
was a collaboration
of over 100 physicists

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.880 align:middle line:10%
from different universities,
geared towards solving

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.580 align:middle line:10%
this solar neutrino problem.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.790 align:middle line:10%
It was designed using a
thousand tons of heavy deuterium

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:10%
water submerged inside a
larger vessel of regular water,

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.320 align:middle line:10%
all surrounded by 10,000
photomultiplier tubes

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.140 align:middle line:10%
to detect the signals.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And this was then located
a mile underground

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.210 align:middle line:10%
in a mine in Sudbury, Canada.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:10%
To say the least, it
was quite a process

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:10%
getting to the actual
on-site laboratory.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:10%
We had to gear up
in miner's gear,

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:10%
take a rickety elevator
down with the miners,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:10%
going one mile deep
into the Earth,

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:10%
then walk over a mile through
dusty tunnels called The Drift.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:10%
Then once we
arrived at the site,

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.820 align:middle line:10%
we had to clean up,
change into cleanroom

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:10%
gear for our day of work.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And every now and
then, hearing popping

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.095 align:middle line:84%
sounds of the Earth
shifting around

00:11:23.095 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
us, wondering in the
backs of our minds

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.810 align:middle line:84%
if there might be a
collapse in the tunnels

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:29.330 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:90%
But fortunately, they never did.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And while I worked on the
project for four years,

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:84%
I was happy to only have to
spend one summer on-site.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:10%
Anyhow, the Sudbury
Neutrino Observatory group

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:10%
was able to verify that the
solar model was correct,

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:10%
that neutrinos do oscillate.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:10%
And they were also able to
identify a more accurate range

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:10%
of masses for the neutrinos.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.300 align:middle line:84%
What can we learn from
these neutrino oscillations?

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.820 align:middle line:90%
How does this apply to us?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing,
we must realize that we

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:90%
each have our own rhythm.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:07.680 align:middle line:10%
But when we are coupled
with other people,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:10%
such as in an
intimate relationship

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:10%
or when working on
projects with colleagues,

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:10%
we also need to be aware
that each person has

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:10%
their own unique rhythm.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:21.060 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone is going to be
able to dance to our rhythm

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.200 align:middle line:84%
all the time, even if we
are the boss or the alpha.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be flexible and
mix it up, allow our partners

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to lead when their
rhythm is strong,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
giving us a chance
to rest a bit.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, soon enough,
our turn to lead

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
will come again in the
proper flow and timing.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.340 align:middle line:84%
In addition to this,
we are complex people.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
So how many rhythms do we
have happening simultaneously

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:90%
within our lives?

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.460 align:middle line:90%
We have many rhythms.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.690 align:middle line:84%
We have a biorhythm that is
tied to our day/night cycles,

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
as well as lunar
and solar cycles.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:84%
We also have emotional
rhythm, which

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.770 align:middle line:84%
for women tends to be
tied to the moon phases

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and for men is tied
to the sun phases.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:90%
Then we have mental rhythms.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.360 align:middle line:84%
There are times when we are
in high creativity phases

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
and other times of
low mental energy.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
There's also the
rhythm of our spirit.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
This one tends to flow on an
accelerating and expanding

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:84%
scale, like a Fibonacci
spiral, rather than

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
a linear or circular
progression.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
Many of our cultural
rhythms are based

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:90%
on linear or circular flows.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
But the rhythm and
progression of life

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is meant to be ever-expanding
and accelerating,

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.990 align:middle line:84%
like the golden spiral
and Fibonacci sequence.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
When we are living in
sync with this rhythm,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
that is when we will feel
fully alive and progressing

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:90%
towards our full potential.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Many of us feel the
pressure of an accelerated

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.570 align:middle line:90%
rhythm in our world today.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:90%
Things are happening so fast.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.660 align:middle line:84%
When we feel challenged to
keep up with today's rhythm,

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.060 align:middle line:84%
it's partly because
we are clinging

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to old programming and
ways of operating that

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:90%
are linear or circular.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason is
because we just aren't

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.630 align:middle line:90%
aware of our spirit's rhythm.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.940 align:middle line:84%
The shift in our
collective consciousness

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
is being driven by
the evolutionary leap

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:90%
our spirit is striving towards.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is the rhythm we
need to attune our body, mind,

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and soul to.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.600 align:middle line:84%
How do we shift our rhythm
to harness this principle?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.660 align:middle line:84%
First, we have to be aware
of our cycles and rhythms,

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.060 align:middle line:84%
know when we are in a flow
versus when we are in an ebb.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Second, rather than fighting
it, learn to use it.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.120 align:middle line:84%
This only happens, though,
when we are prepared

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:90%
for the pendulum to swing.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, many people these
days want to be in the flow

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.250 align:middle line:84%
That is not sustainable,
and it leads to burnout.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The principle of rhythm says
all things rise and fall.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:02.550 align:middle line:84%
After the flow
will come the ebb.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:90%
It is inevitable.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:84%
But by being
prepared for the ebb,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:84%
we can use it to rest, recover,
and take care of ourselves.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
As we do, we will then be ready
to maximize upon the next flow

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And by resting during the
ebb rather than fighting it,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.690 align:middle line:84%
we will help support
our rhythm to shift

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:90%
back into the flow faster.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Even better, though, is to
create our own rhythm that

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
accounts for both
ebb and flow, meaning

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that we can purposefully
incorporate downtime

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
into our weekly schedule
to maintain balance.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
This involves knowing our rhythm
and how much recovery time we

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:90%
need to bounce back.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything more we can do
to master the effects of rhythm

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.570 align:middle line:90%
in our lives?

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Hermetic initiates have
methods of bringing themselves

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.350 align:middle line:90%
to a balance point at will.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
They have learned how to
use this principle of rhythm

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.070 align:middle line:90%
rather than be used by it.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Typically, as this
principal says,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
the degree to which
we swing one way

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.000 align:middle line:84%
will be followed
by an equal degree

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:90%
of swing the opposite way.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
For example, if someone swings
into a high or elated state,

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
such as being happy
about some event,

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.600 align:middle line:84%
that state is often
conditional and transient,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
based on outer circumstances.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
We can expect that, soon
enough, that same person

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
will be swinging to the
low or depressed state.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The degree of swing low will
match the degree of swing high.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.580 align:middle line:84%
This can make for an
emotional roller coaster.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Rather than seeking
the high, we should

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
be seeking the balance point and
to minimize the degree of swing

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.370 align:middle line:90%
to one side or the other.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticists, Kabbalists,
and mystics all

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
have methods of establishing
and reinforcing balance

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalists call this
living in the middle pillar.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Such a life is one that is
full of joy, passion, purpose,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
and constantly raising our
balance point to higher

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:11.160 align:middle line:90%
levels of vibration.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Rather than seeking
feelings of happiness,

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:84%
which are fleeting and
based on outer circumstances

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.950 align:middle line:84%
or conditions, we
seek joy, which

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
is an inner state of being
that is our natural state when

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.339 align:middle line:90%
we live in the middle pillar.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The swings of the
pendulum are what

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:84%
pull us out of that calm,
peaceful, joyful center.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Thus, to master our
rhythm, we create

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:90%
a lifestyle of balance and joy.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
True balance is a very
dynamic state of being.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:90%
It is not static.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:84%
There is always movement
in some area of our life.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:90%
And we seek that movement.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of saying
it is we seek progression.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of getting
stuck in a comfort zone,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
we realize that magic,
miracles, and alchemy

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:90%
happen outside the comfort zone.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Outside the comfort zone is
where the juice of life is.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Here, the rhythm is
exciting and vibrant.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, inside the comfort
zone, the rhythm of life

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
becomes like a
dull, constant march

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that hypnotizes us into becoming
like sleepwalkers in life.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Through personal and
spiritual alchemy,

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.960 align:middle line:84%
we can learn to
shift our balance

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.860 align:middle line:84%
point to higher vibrations
and levels of attainment.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Living the middle
pillar involves

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:32.780 align:middle line:84%
bringing the polar aspects of
ourselves into equilibrium.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
First, we bring in equal amounts
of discipline and structure

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:84%
on the one hand, balanced
with creativity and intuition

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.550 align:middle line:90%
on the other.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Next is to bring into
balance the power

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
of the warrior with the love
and mercy of the healer.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the most
important balance

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
is that of masculine
and feminine energies

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:90%
or aspects of creation.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.840 align:middle line:84%
These correlate with the
three horizontal bars

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.030 align:middle line:90%
on the Kabbalistic tree of life.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Here, again, we see
the power of three.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, to scientists, this
reoccurring pattern of three

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:90%
is puzzling.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to make sense of it.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:16.130 align:middle line:84%
But they admit it must be a clue
to something deeper, something

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.430 align:middle line:84%
that lies beyond
ordinary physics.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:middle line:10%
Alchemists and Kabbalists,
on the other hand,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.640 align:middle line:10%
offer great insights
about why three.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.150 align:middle line:10%
Interestingly, all the particles
from the standard model

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:10%
of physics could
be neatly arranged

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.580 align:middle line:10%
on the three-dimensional
tree of life

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:10%
to perhaps provide new
insights for scientists.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:10%
In this arrangement, the
12 particles of matter

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:10%
are assigned to the four
outer pillars, each pillar

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.720 align:middle line:10%
representing one set of
the three generations,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:10%
while the five
particles of force

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:10%
that mediate
interactions of matter

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.960 align:middle line:10%
are assigned to
the middle pillar.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.630 align:middle line:10%
Then through all of the
tree flows the light

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.630 align:middle line:10%
of spirit from source.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.860 align:middle line:84%
What do the alchemists
have to say?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to
the ancient wisdom,

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.740 align:middle line:84%
if we are to generate
anything new,

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
there must be both masculine
and feminine principles

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:90%
working together.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Western alchemists call these
principles Sol and Luna,

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.860 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes also
sulfur and salt.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And just like it takes both
a male seed and a female egg

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:10%
to conceive a child, the
creative potentials of either

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.020 align:middle line:10%
masculine or feminine alone
cannot accomplish anything

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.880 align:middle line:10%
on their own.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.800 align:middle line:10%
They must be united together.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.530 align:middle line:10%
Their union creates
an animated seed

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:10%
that combines both aspects
of masculine and feminine

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:10%
into a third thing.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.770 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists call this
third essential mercury.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
Only with all three
essentials do we have life.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:84%
It takes the union of
the two through a third

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.310 align:middle line:84%
to generate anything
new or to allow

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
for transformation and
transmutation to take place.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the great alchemy
initiates of the West,

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Peracelsus, said, 500
years ago, "All things

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:84%
created by nature consist of
three primary elements, namely

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
natural mercury, sulfur,
and salt in combination.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Wherever corporal salt is
mixed with spiritual mercury

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and animated sulfur
into one body,

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:84%
then nature begins to work by
means of a separating fire."

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.460 align:middle line:84%
These three essentials of
salt, sulfur, and mercury

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.550 align:middle line:84%
are also found in the alchemical
traditions of the East

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.250 align:middle line:90%
under different names.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.360 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurvedic alchemy, they're
called Kapha, Pitta, and Vata.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
In Yogic alchemy, they're the
Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.850 align:middle line:10%
In Daoist alchemy, they
are the Jing, Qi, and Shen.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Peracelsus also coined
the term spagyrics,

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.420 align:middle line:84%
which means to draw out the
essence through a process

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:90%
of separating and reassembling.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Through this process,
the essentials

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
are purified,
uplifted, and restored

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:84%
to their original
eternal purity.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:84%
At first, these
three essentials are

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
bound up together
within any materia,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.410 align:middle line:84%
but that materia is polluted
or corrupted in some way.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.840 align:middle line:84%
To perform the alchemy,
they must first

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:90%
be extracted or drawn out.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.580 align:middle line:84%
From this, they are carefully
separated and then purified.

00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:30.350 align:middle line:84%
This raises the vibration,
lifting the body up to spirit

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and also drawing down the
spirit to become more embodied.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:84%
In this heightened
and enlivened state,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.230 align:middle line:84%
the three purified essentials
are then recombined and brought

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to a stabilized
and perfected form.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But what are these three
essentials within us?

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Hermes Trismegistus
says that they

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.150 align:middle line:90%
are body, soul, and spirit.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Peracelsus clarifies that
mercury is the spirit,

00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
sulfur is the soul,
and salt is the body.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, in today's
scientific terminology,

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.640 align:middle line:84%
we could see them as mass for
the body, energy for the soul,

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and light for the
spirit, such as we

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:84%
see maybe in the three terms
of Einstein's famous equation,

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
E equals mc squared.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Or there's also Newton's second
law of motion, F equals m a,

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:84%
where the three become mass,
force, and acceleration.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.640 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
these two equations,

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.690 align:middle line:84%
we see that they
both relate to mass.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And recall, from earlier,
how quarks and leptons

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and neutrinos can only
transform between generations

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.140 align:middle line:90%
because they have mass.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.190 align:middle line:84%
If the mass is zero, then
there is no intrinsic energy

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:47.060 align:middle line:90%
to physically transform with.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.180 align:middle line:90%
What does this tell us?

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, one way we
could interpret this

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.220 align:middle line:84%
is that bringing energy,
light, or spirit down

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
into material density
is necessary for

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:90%
the transformational process.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:10%
This would agree with the
lines in the "Emerald Tablets"

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:10%
of Hermes, where it
says, "The power of it

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.040 align:middle line:10%
is integral, if it is
turned into Earth."

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:84%
From a quantum
physics perspective,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.370 align:middle line:84%
we could also associate these
three essentials with matter,

00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.760 align:middle line:84%
as in fermions,
force, as in bosons,

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness or will,
which the alchemists also

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
call the secret fire residing at
the center core of every atom.

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.610 align:middle line:84%
These relate to the three
pillars of the Kabbalistic tree

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:32.900 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.200 align:middle line:84%
The pillar on the left is
often called the pillar of form

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and is seen as feminine.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:10%
The pillar on the right is
often called the pillar of force

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.840 align:middle line:10%
and is seen as masculine, while
the middle pillar is called

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.600 align:middle line:10%
the pillar of equilibrium,
where the two side

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.281 align:middle line:10%
pillars of masculine
and feminine unite.

00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:54.030 align:middle line:84%
The various levels
of the middle pillar

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:90%
often correlate with the will.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:90%
At the top is divine will.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
In the center is the
will of the universe.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.780 align:middle line:10%
The second from the bottom
is our human collective will.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:06.960 align:middle line:10%
And the very bottom
is our body's will.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:90%


00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.910 align:middle line:10%
Not only are there three
pillars on the tree of life,

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.035 align:middle line:10%
each of those has three spheres
on it above the physical.

00:25:19.035 --> 00:25:22.010 align:middle line:10%
A study of the tree's
structure reveals

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:25.310 align:middle line:10%
that there are also three
main triads and three

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.250 align:middle line:10%
horizontal cross bars.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.390 align:middle line:10%
And the Kabbalistic book,
the "Sefer Yetzirah,"

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:31.990 align:middle line:10%
also talks about there
being three mother letters--

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.090 align:middle line:10%
aleph, mem, and shin.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.880 align:middle line:10%
Clearly, the power
of three is well

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.400 align:middle line:10%
recognized by the Kabbalists.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.710 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah teaches
us that only when

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:47.660 align:middle line:84%
the third aspect came in
could the universe be created.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.060 align:middle line:10%
There must be a source
of all light, which

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:55.320 align:middle line:10%
is represented by the apex of
the tree, called the crown.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Then that light must
be expanded out.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:84%
This outward reaching force
is the masculine aspect

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.990 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:06.980 align:middle line:84%
It is the emanation from
the source, called wisdom.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.460 align:middle line:10%
But if that power is to be
harnessed in order to bring

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:10%
anything into
formation, there must

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.190 align:middle line:10%
be a third aspect that
draws the light inward

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:10%
to be embodied in form.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:10%
This inward movement
towards form

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:26.030 align:middle line:10%
is the feminine aspect of
creation, called understanding.

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.930 align:middle line:10%
It completes the upper triad,
or the first sacred geometry

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:10%
of the triangle.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.790 align:middle line:10%
From these, the three
pillars are also established,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.190 align:middle line:10%
as the rest of the tree
is formed according

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:10%
to this original pattern.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:10%
But only when we have three
aspects can form be generated.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.250 align:middle line:84%
So the power of three is
necessary for light or spirit

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to come into the physical, where
it can transform and evolve.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.325 align:middle line:84%
What is spirit or light
trying to transform into?

00:26:58.325 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, alchemists,
of course, talk

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:90%
about the philosopher's stone.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.470 align:middle line:10%
And there are many
interpretations

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:10%
of what that is, because alchemy
can be applied in many ways.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.480 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalists have a vision of
becoming the Adam Kadmon, which

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.170 align:middle line:84%
translates as the godlike
or perfected human.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Adam Kadmon is said to be a
perfectly unified light body,

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:84%
where the three aspects
of body, soul, and spirit

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.340 align:middle line:84%
have all been
transformed, transmuted,

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
and unified into one
immortal being of light.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan Buddhism
has a similar level

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.190 align:middle line:84%
of realization they
call the rainbow body,

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.980 align:middle line:84%
or Dzogchen, the
great perfection.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:84%
How is such a state of
perfection accomplished?

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It is something that happens
only in the physical.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It can be attained
from devoting oneself

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:50.780 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual and
internal alchemy process.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies literally
are alchemical vessels

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.770 align:middle line:84%
that produce all manner
of transformations.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Our mind and soul must also go
through the alchemical process,

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
as these are the mediator
between spirit and body.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:12.110 align:middle line:10%
Peracelsus says the soul "unites
the two contraries, the body

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:16.370 align:middle line:10%
and the spirit, and changes
them into one essence."

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.520 align:middle line:90%
What does this tell us?

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, alchemy works
through the interplay

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:25.070 align:middle line:84%
of these three essentials
uniting to become one essence.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:29.660 align:middle line:84%
It also tells us that if we want
to unite our body and spirit so

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
that we can fulfill
our potential

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and create a better life, we
must do so through the soul.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:90%
Why the soul?

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the soul is the
operating system and interface

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:84%
that allows our eternal
spirit to interact

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.810 align:middle line:90%
with the physical body.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:84%
The soul mediates the high
vibrational energies of spirit

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and filters it so that the
body can handle and utilize

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.430 align:middle line:90%
the energy at this level.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
It also translates the signals
and energy from the body

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.220 align:middle line:90%
back up to spirit.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
But our soul's
operating system can

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:84%
become corrupted by faulty
programming or unhealed

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:14.190 align:middle line:84%
traumas that lead to
glitches in the system.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know
a lot about our bodies

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.670 align:middle line:84%
and what it takes to
live a healthy life,

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:90%
but what stops us?

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we do what we
know is needed to thrive?

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, our mental patterns,
our emotional attachments,

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.030 align:middle line:84%
our habits, our subconscious
sabotage mechanisms,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:36.750 align:middle line:84%
our belief systems, and other
ways we block ourselves.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it's the programs

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that cause our soul not
to function properly

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.460 align:middle line:84%
and disrupts the energy
flow of our good intentions.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.160 align:middle line:84%
These faulty programs
and indoctrinations

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:84%
that corrupt our soul
are things we have

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.750 align:middle line:90%
learned from the outer world.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.510 align:middle line:90%
They are not true to our spirit.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:01.340 align:middle line:84%
To correct this, we need to
purify, debug, and upgrade

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.840 align:middle line:84%
the operating system of our soul
if we want to make progress.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Yet, so many people are so
focused on the outer world.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.710 align:middle line:84%
They think that we have
to change the outer first.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.430 align:middle line:84%
But the outer is a
manifestation of the inner.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.920 align:middle line:84%
We need to change
the inner first.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, the problems
we see in the outer world,

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.540 align:middle line:84%
like war, poverty,
inequality, and so forth,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.900 align:middle line:84%
are manifestations of the
issues we have inside of us.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:32.960 align:middle line:90%
We are at odds with ourselves.

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We feel lack and
not enough inside.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.830 align:middle line:84%
We treat ourselves unfairly,
often being our own worst

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.660 align:middle line:90%
critic, and so on.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
This is all because of
the faulty programming

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.050 align:middle line:90%
and misalignment of our soul.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:50.795 align:middle line:84%
How do we reprogram
and transform our soul?

00:30:50.795 --> 00:30:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are many
methods and practices,

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.570 align:middle line:84%
from Tibetan, Yogic,
Daoist, Kabbalistic,

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:58.130 align:middle line:84%
and other mystery
school traditions

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:90%
that are all helpful.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.000 align:middle line:84%
These practices are
geared towards learning

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to harness this alchemy within
the body, mind, and soul.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.950 align:middle line:84%
For example,
meditation is great,

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:14.540 align:middle line:84%
because it helps us quiet the
mind and find peace within.

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.460 align:middle line:90%
But that is just one aspect.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.030 align:middle line:84%
We also need to
reprogram and reorient

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.910 align:middle line:84%
our mental and
emotional constructs.

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:26.240 align:middle line:84%
We need to truly
heal and transform,

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.690 align:middle line:84%
reminding our soul
of who we really are

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:33.000 align:middle line:90%
as a spirit of love and light.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to rectify the
faulty programs of our soul.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:41.030 align:middle line:84%
To work on the soul is
to work on the depth.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.510 align:middle line:84%
If we return to the analogy of
a computer operating system,

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:47.480 align:middle line:84%
and it gets infected
by a virus or malware,

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.680 align:middle line:90%
we have three options.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:84%
One, we can erase
the whole system

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.480 align:middle line:90%
and start with a new one.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Two, find an expert who
knows how to fix it.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:32:00.950 align:middle line:10%
Or three, learn the
programming language ourselves.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.110 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
the soul, option one

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:90%
really isn't an option.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So we are left with
options two and three.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Also, with regards to the soul,
all healing is self-healing.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.700 align:middle line:84%
We can hire an expert to help
us, such as a skilled healer.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.710 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we
are the ones who

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
have to go into the depth to
heal and transform ourselves.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:24.890 align:middle line:84%
Any good healer
of integrity will

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:28.430 align:middle line:84%
say that their job is to
simply facilitate and guide

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the process, to
help us speed it up,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:36.500 align:middle line:84%
but we have to be ready to
receive and do the work.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:84%
And when we want to get really
good at self-transforming,

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:44.670 align:middle line:84%
we must work even more
to attain self mastery.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.270 align:middle line:84%
This means we have to
learn the programming

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.060 align:middle line:84%
language of the soul
so that we can address

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:90%
any internal issues as needed.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.240 align:middle line:84%
It means we dive into
understanding our operating

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.060 align:middle line:84%
system and move
beyond just working

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
the feel-good applications.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:04.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where people who
live the tools of Kabbalah

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and walk a path of initiation
in the mysteries really thrive.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:13.050 align:middle line:84%
On the Kabbalistic tree
of life, the top triad

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:15.540 align:middle line:84%
represents spirit,
while the bottom sphere

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.220 align:middle line:90%
represents the body.

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything else in
between is the soul.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:84%
As we ascend the
tree of life, we

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.910 align:middle line:84%
discover the intricate
workings of our soul

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.820 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to
debug and reprogram

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.180 align:middle line:84%
each module of our
soul's operating system.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah is like an
owner's manual to life

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:41.010 align:middle line:84%
and shows us how to optimize the
functions of our mind and soul

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.100 align:middle line:84%
so that we can live
our full potential.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It brings us the
deeper knowledge

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that we need to come to a
greater understanding of how

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:90%
we transform ourselves.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.550 align:middle line:84%
When we become more self-aware,
we can then more easily

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.360 align:middle line:84%
recognize what life is
trying to reflect to us.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.250 align:middle line:84%
As such, ascending
the tree of life

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.970 align:middle line:84%
becomes a very accelerated
process to up-leveling

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.429 align:middle line:90%
how our soul is operating.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
It is a form of
spiritual alchemy.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:15.600 align:middle line:84%
When we realign our soul to our
spirit, everything in our life

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.880 align:middle line:84%
flows better, and we are able
to create a life we love.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And for those who truly want
to achieve their full potential

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and become a fully awakened
and perfected human,

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.989 align:middle line:84%
there is a path that
can lead us there.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:33.179 align:middle line:84%
It is an alchemical
path that takes us

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:37.350 align:middle line:84%
through all the stages, from
nigredo to albedo to rubedo.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And it continues on
through however many cycles

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of this process as are
needed to raise our vibration

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:49.679 align:middle line:84%
to that highest level, until we
eventually recombine our three

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
essentials of spirit, soul, and
body into one indestructible

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:59.370 align:middle line:84%
whole, combining within us
the powers of above and below

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:84%
until we become the
philosopher's stone, the Adam

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.410 align:middle line:90%
Kadmon, the rainbow body.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:07.250 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore deeper

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:84%
into the secret
fire of alchemists

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and discover how we can control
the atoms of our bodies.

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:17.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:23.160 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with me in this
episode of "Mystery Teachings."
