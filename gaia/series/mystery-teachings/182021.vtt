00:00:14.067 --> 00:00:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> THERESA BULLARD: I'm
Dr. Theresa Bullard,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.700 align:middle line:90%
and this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.180 align:middle line:84%
How can we truly harness
our potential and awaken

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:90%
to higher consciousness?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Humanity is at the precipice
of making a great shift

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.710 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness,
in how we live,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:90%
and who we see ourselves as.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
We must make a quantum leap if
we are to fulfill our destiny

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:90%
and potential.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
We now recognize that
our life in this world

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:84%
is a hologram, a shadow or
projection from a higher, more

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
unified reality where
our true self resides,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
a realm beyond the
quantum vacuum,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.090 align:middle line:90%
possibly out in the multiverse.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And from that higher
reality, our true self

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.010 align:middle line:84%
observes and conducts many
simultaneous parallel realities

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
through a variety of
holographic projections.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this episode,
we tie it all together

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.420 align:middle line:84%
by bringing ourselves
back to the source,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to the center point where
it all emanates from.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's discover together what
this experience is really

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
about, the essential
purpose of it all.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Many great minds have
searched for the keys

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to how consciousness
and matter unite

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and how we can harness
these phenomena.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:84%
One such great mind
was Wolfgang Pauli,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the fathers of the
quantum physics revolution,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
who was inspired by
a series of dreams

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to dedicate the last
half of his life

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.990 align:middle line:90%
to understanding this issue.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.780 align:middle line:84%
He claimed that
psyche and matter

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.355 align:middle line:84%
are governed by a common,
neutral, unestablishable

00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:00.765 align:middle line:90%
ordering principle.

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, what did he mean by that?

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, by unestablishable,
Pauli was

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:84%
referring to a concept proposed
by Carl Jung, the great depth

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.300 align:middle line:84%
psychologist and initiate
of the mysteries.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
These two great minds
had become friends

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and corresponded quite
frequently by letter.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Jung called the
world of archetypes

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
as not-establisable, whereas
the world of human experience,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:84%
including how the
archetypes show up

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:84%
in our dreams and
synchronicities,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.800 align:middle line:90%
he called this establishable.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Archetypes are the repeated
themes, motifs, patterns,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and roles that play
out again and again

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.310 align:middle line:84%
throughout human
history and mythology.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:84%
These archetypes are
what Pauli was referring

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to when he said psyche
and matter share

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:90%
a common ordering principle.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
But in Pauli's view, they needed
to find a neutral language,

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:84%
or a way of describing
this other realm,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
so that it could be
bridged into physics.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.600 align:middle line:84%
He proposed that numbers,
symbols, and mathematics

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.930 align:middle line:84%
were the keys to finding
such a common ground.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Pauli also felt deeply
that the underlying

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:84%
order of the universe was
one that had symmetry.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Symmetry brings order to a
universe that might otherwise

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:90%
be chaotic.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:84%
It was this
adherence to symmetry

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that gave Pauli
the insight needed

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to formulate his
exclusion principle,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.500 align:middle line:84%
which became one of the
foundation stones of quantum

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:84%
physics and won him the
Nobel Prize in 1945.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Today's physicists
have again returned

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
to this principle of
symmetry, as they now

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.170 align:middle line:84%
propose various grand unified
theories, supersymmetric string

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
theories, cosmological
inflation,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.970 align:middle line:90%
and the holographic model.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:84%
The first physicist to
propose the holographic model

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.800 align:middle line:84%
as a way of uniting both matter
and consciousness into physics

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.480 align:middle line:90%
was David Bohm.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Bohm described what he called
the implicate order as a deeper

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
reality where all is an
undivided wholeness, including

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.100 align:middle line:90%
mine and matter.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
As this deeper reality
is projected or surfaces

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.750 align:middle line:84%
into our 3D world, parts of
its structure and activity

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.190 align:middle line:90%
can be perceived and measured.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Bohm called our reality
of sensory experience

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:90%
the explicate order.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
This idea is very
similar to Jung's

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:84%
not-establisable and
establishable worlds.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Pauli, Jung, Bohm all realized,
from a scientific approach,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.110 align:middle line:84%
that our experiential world
represents just a small thread

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
in a much larger tapestry of
wholeness and completeness.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Pauli and Jung believed that
higher dimensional tapestry

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.050 align:middle line:84%
to be a metaphysical
reality, one

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that is home to the collective
unconscious and the archetypes.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:84%
What is meant by
collective unconscious?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Jung defined it as a collective,
universal, and impersonal

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.130 align:middle line:84%
nature which is identical
in all individuals.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
This collective
unconscious is inherited.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And it consists of pre-existent
forms, the archetypes.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.050 align:middle line:84%
He saw it as a
timeless realm out

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:90%
of which consciousness evolves.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Jung's research revealed
that symbols, dreams,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
synchronicities,
and imagery were

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
the ways the archetypes
communicate to our psyche.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Pauli believed that mathematics,
physical processes, and quantum

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:84%
probabilities must
also be archetypal.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And Jung agreed that
numbers, particularly

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
numbers one through
four, were the simplest

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.920 align:middle line:84%
and most fundamental archetypes
that related directly

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.620 align:middle line:90%
to both matter and psyche.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Through an active
imagination exercise,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Pauli once received an
epiphany about a key symbol

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:84%
for the marriage of
matter and psyche.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:90%
That symbol is the i ring.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:90%
What is the i ring?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.780 align:middle line:84%
It is a mathematical
circle of unit radius

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
in the complex numbers plane
where the horizontal axis

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.550 align:middle line:84%
consists of real numbers,
while the vertical axis is

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
imaginary numbers.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
In mathematics, the symbol
i represents the square root

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.550 align:middle line:84%
of minus 1, which is
nonsensical to the real world.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And thus, it is called
an imaginary number.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:84%
But even though
it has no meaning

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.950 align:middle line:84%
in the real physical world,
mathematics and physics

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.620 align:middle line:90%
would be incomplete without it.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
The use of complex
numbers that contain

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.840 align:middle line:84%
both real and imaginary numbers
is an integral part of science.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But this imaginary axis is
a mystery to scientists,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
probably because they only
consider the real world

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:90%
as the physical.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
If the physical is but a
slice of the greater reality,

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps these imaginary
numbers can serve as a bridge

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:90%
to that greater reality.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.530 align:middle line:90%
How might that work?

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer that, let's
explore the i ring further.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle line:84%
For a complex number, a plus
ib that sits on this i ring,

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.040 align:middle line:84%
there is an angle theta
that measures where

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.180 align:middle line:90%
the number sits on the circle.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
The formula that
expresses this circle

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
is known as Euler's formula,
e to the power i theta,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.700 align:middle line:84%
where e is the base
of natural logarithms

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:90%
and has a value of about 2.718.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
A case of this formula,
called Euler's identity,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
occurs for theta
equals pi in radians,

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
pi being the famous 3.14 ratio
of a circle's circumference

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:90%
to its diameter.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
For Euler's identity,
the relation

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:01.796 align:middle line:84%
becomes e to the power
i pi equals minus 1.

00:08:01.796 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
This Euler's identity
is considered

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to be an example of supreme
mathematical beauty,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
because it shows a profound
connection between some

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.214 align:middle line:84%
of the most fundamental numbers
in mathematics, namely e, i,

00:08:15.214 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:90%
and pi.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
A relation could
even be extended

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:84%
to include the
golden ratio of phi,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.850 align:middle line:84%
giving an even more
profound connection to how

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:84%
these numbers and
Euler's formula

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.760 align:middle line:84%
all relate to
nature's golden mean.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:84%
Each of these numbers, e, phi,
pi, and the square root of 5

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
are all called
transcendental numbers,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
because they transcend the
power of algebraic methods.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Why should we care
about this. i ring?

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:90%
How does it relate to us?

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Again, Pauli was
shown this ironing

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
as a key symbol for the
marriage of matter and psyche,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.900 align:middle line:90%
of physical and spiritual.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's imagine for a moment
that the horizontal axis

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:84%
represents our entire
three-dimensional physical

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, it
cuts a single line

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.600 align:middle line:90%
through this complex plane.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.210 align:middle line:90%
It is but a slice.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if we imagine
that the vertical axis

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
of the imaginary
numbers represents

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.830 align:middle line:84%
the world of pure spirit,
we can see that on its own,

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:90%
it too, is just a slice.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But together, they create a
rich field of possibility.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And this might be
why spirit has chosen

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
to come into the
physical, to give us

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.620 align:middle line:84%
more possibilities for
experience and growth.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Only by expanding
our consciousness

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical can
we bring our awareness

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
to greatness and pierce
the veils of illusion.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
This means we need to lift off
that horizontal axis, where

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.670 align:middle line:84%
we get focused on just
the physical realm,

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and gain some higher perspective
from the non-physical planes

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.120 align:middle line:90%
of the vertical axis.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.610 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we've heard
this idea before.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:84%
But by now associating this
concept with the i ring,

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:90%
it reveals even deeper insights.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Like what?

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, this brings
us back to the idea

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
of hado, or vibrational essence,
discussed in other episodes.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Recall that Dr. Masaru Emoto is
very dedicated to the science

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.020 align:middle line:90%
of hado and its applications.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
Hado is that vibrational
energy of atomic waves

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.470 align:middle line:84%
generated by the
dynamic movements

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:84%
of the electrons, quarks, and
central fire within atoms.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
In his book "Truth
of Hado," Dr. Emoto

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
cites another eminent Japanese
scientist, Dr. Ohashi,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
who researched extensively
into the science of hado.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
In one of his books
on hado science,

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:01.090 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ohashi introduces the
concept of imaginary nature.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Japanese
kanji, this concept

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
is known as kyoshitsu,
which can also be

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.240 align:middle line:90%
translated as void substance.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
Kyo in kanji means emptiness,
void, or imaginary.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Shitsu means nature,
quality, or substance.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ohashi explained
that imaginary nature

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:84%
is analogous to emptiness in
Buddhism or hollow in Daoism,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:84%
one body in Western philosophy,
or the sacred, essential hoa

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.080 align:middle line:90%
in kabbalah.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Hoa in Hebrew means he,
himself, or in Aramaic, it

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:90%
means fulfilled or to exist.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically, this all relates
to the quantum vacuum or ether.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ohashi she goes on
to say that the concept

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.030 align:middle line:84%
of imaginary nature is
the basis of hado science.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
If the ocean is
the mother of life,

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:03.510 align:middle line:84%
then imaginary nature is
the parent of the universe.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.400 align:middle line:84%
This is, again, very similar
to David Bohm's description

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.210 align:middle line:90%
of the implicate order.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.860 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ohashi uses the
terms real dimensions

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.920 align:middle line:84%
to represent this 3D
physical world which

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:90%
is Bohm's explicate order.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And then the term
imaginary dimensions

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
is used for the other
world, or implicate order.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Here we see that Dr.
Ohashi is talking

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
about the complex numbers
of real and imaginary parts,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
which brings us back
again to the i ring.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:84%
But rather than just the
circumference of the,

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
ring Dr. Ohashi is referring
to the entire plane

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.290 align:middle line:84%
of complex numbers
as imaginary nature.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.740 align:middle line:84%
He says, for example, that
things in real dimensions

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.040 align:middle line:84%
cannot occupy the
exact same space,

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
but things in imaginary
dimensions can.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And those things would
include our soul, our spirit,

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness, and so on,
each at different frequencies

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
or numbers on the
imaginary axis.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Is this just a
symbolic application

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.981 align:middle line:84%
of imaginary numbers,
or is there more to it?

00:13:11.981 --> 00:13:15.080 align:middle line:84%
To address that question,
Dr. Ohashi says,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.400 align:middle line:84%
this imaginary nature may seem
a jump from physical science.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:84%
But one cannot solve the
mystery of the universe without

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:90%
assuming imaginary nature.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And the primary
objective of hado science

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.160 align:middle line:84%
is to prove that physical
science and the spiritual world

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:84%
are bound with the same energy,
the atomic waves, also known

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:90%
as hado.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.630 align:middle line:90%
What are these atomic waves?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Emoto claims
the source of hado

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:84%
is the consciousness
of human beings.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
All phenomena are structured
by the consciousness

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:55.510 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:84%
That sounds like
a lofty statement.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.710 align:middle line:84%
How can human consciousness
be the cause of all phenomena

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and of the energy of
hado or atomic waves?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, that is the
profound revelation

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.960 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Emoto
tried to demonstrate

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
using his famous water crystals
as a visual representation

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:90%
of hado.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.650 align:middle line:84%
He showed that when humans think
and feel positive qualities

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:23.320 align:middle line:84%
like love and
gratitude, it puts out

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
harmonious vibrations
that generate

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:84%
beautiful and symmetric
water crystals.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But when humans think and feel
negative qualities like hate

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
or sadness, it puts out
disharmonious vibrations

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
that lead to a lack
of beauty and symmetry

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.420 align:middle line:90%
in the water crystals.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts and feelings
can alter the structure

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:90%
of physical phenomena.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:84%
This world we see
today is largely

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
one of disharmony
and negativity.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And we wonder why the
waters of the world

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
have become so polluted and why
more people are experiencing

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:90%
illness and strange diseases.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Could it be because human
collective consciousness has

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:90%
become too polluted and toxic?

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Emoto's research
into hado and water

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:15.610 align:middle line:84%
indicates that this is a
big part of the problem.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:90%
What are we to do?

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.330 align:middle line:90%
How do we clean this up.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, the solution rests in
us becoming more conscious.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Alchemists have long
sought to harness

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.530 align:middle line:84%
the power of higher
consciousness through what they

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:90%
call the secret fire.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
The more we kindle
the flame within us,

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
the more we are able
to purify and transform

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:90%
our body, mind, and soul.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
That flame, that secret
fire is an expansion

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:46.240 align:middle line:84%
of the spark of divinity
within each of us,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.870 align:middle line:84%
the more we become
conscious of ourselves

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:53.550 align:middle line:84%
as divine beings, the
brighter our flame becomes.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to access
the divine spark

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.160 align:middle line:84%
within the core of our being
and expand it or draw it out.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.610 align:middle line:84%
This divine spark is
what enlivens matter.

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:11.700 align:middle line:84%
It animates, engenders, and
makes matter move or vibrate.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
At the quantum subatomic levels,
the pure essence of source

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
comes together with the pure
essence of physical density.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.670 align:middle line:84%
As these two different
energies unite,

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:26.280 align:middle line:90%
a new vibration is generated.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%
This new vibration from the
union of spirit into matter

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
sends out ripples in the form
of atomic waves, or hado.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:84%
The way our consciousness
plays into this

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
is based on how awakened
we are to our divinity

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.950 align:middle line:84%
as well as how much we
exercise our consciousness

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:90%
to harness its power.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:84%
The more we can direct
our consciousness

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
in the right ways, the
more we fan the flames

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.000 align:middle line:84%
of our divine essence
and thereby generate

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:84%
stronger and more
harmonious hado.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:90%
Where is this divine spark?

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:90%
How do we access it?

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
The divine spark is at
the center of every atom.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.010 align:middle line:84%
It operates on the quantum level
within the zero-point field

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
or ether or what Dr. Ohashi
called imaginary nature.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:84%
If we return to the i
ring, the imaginary nature

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:25.079 align:middle line:90%
is seen as the whole plane.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:84%
But the divine spark is
the origin or center point,

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
the zero point of that ring.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.740 align:middle line:84%
On the kabbalistic
tree of life, we

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:84%
find that central fire or divine
spark within the middle pillar.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle line:84%
Recall that the three
dimensional tree of life,

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:84%
when viewed from above, looks
like four points or quarters

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:90%
surrounding a central point.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.120 align:middle line:84%
When we overlay this view
of the tree onto the i ring,

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:90%
we see a perfect match.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
And as the tree rotates,
its four outer points

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:84%
traverse the circle
of the i ring.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The center is stillness,
while out beyond the center

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:90%
is dynamic activity.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
This activity
represents the cycles

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.510 align:middle line:84%
of life and all the
myriad expressions

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
and experiences
of consciousness.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The four pillars or outer
points on the tree of life

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.630 align:middle line:84%
are about polarity and
duality and the need

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
to balance these
contraries in our lives.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.170 align:middle line:84%
As they cycle around us,
they generate the tensions

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that we often feel in life
between saying yes or saying

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.800 align:middle line:84%
no, between starting
and stopping,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
between expanding
and contracting,

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:84%
between life and death, spirit
and physical, good and evil,

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:90%
light and shadow.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.530 align:middle line:84%
They also represent
the four elements

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:51.910 align:middle line:84%
in our lives and the need to
have them in balance as well.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.580 align:middle line:84%
As the pillars of
the tree rotate,

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
they go through a rhythmic
cycle in the imaginary plane,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.630 align:middle line:90%
or implicate order.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
If we were to look at
one of these points as it

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.200 align:middle line:84%
cycles around the
center, we see that

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
its real and imaginary
numbers, here represented

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:90%
as A and B will change in time.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:18.080 align:middle line:84%
When we look at how these
numbers change in time,

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.010 align:middle line:84%
we see that they oscillate
like a sine wave.

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And the real number wave
is 90 degrees out of phase

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.580 align:middle line:90%
with the imaginary number wave.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.210 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.140 align:middle line:84%
These numbers,
real and imaginary,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
represent frequencies and
rhythms of our physical body

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:90%
and our spirit.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.370 align:middle line:84%
We experience various rhythms at
different levels of our being.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we are
in a positive flow,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously on
multiple levels.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.370 align:middle line:84%
That would be represented
here by both numbers being

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:59.470 align:middle line:90%
in the positive range.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
We also have times,
though, when we

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
might feel physically energized
but spiritually depleted,

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.040 align:middle line:84%
or the reverse, physically
tired but spiritually energized.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Those times are when
one number is positive

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:90%
while the other is negative.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
there are also

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.600 align:middle line:84%
times when we feel depleted
both physically and spiritually,

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:84%
when both numbers
are in the negative.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:84%
But by positive or
negative here, we

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:90%
don't mean good and bad.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It is more like the
yang and the yin phases.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Yang is a time of outward flow.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:84%
We would say it is a time to
be active in an area of life.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And we call it positive
or masculine energy flow,

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
while yin, on the other hand,
is a time of inward flow.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.360 align:middle line:84%
We would say this is a time
to rest and turn inside

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:90%
for introspection.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Numerically, yin is in the
negative range of the scale.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.380 align:middle line:90%
But again, it's not bad.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:90%
This is a feminine energy flow.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And just like the yin
yang symbol shows,

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.200 align:middle line:84%
that there is a little
bit of yin and the yang

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.330 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
of yang in the yin,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.740 align:middle line:84%
we also see that in the rhythms
of the spiritual and physical

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.170 align:middle line:90%
cycles between yin and yang.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:84%
This is due to them being
a little out of phase

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have to go
through such cycles

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:90%
and duality dynamics?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:28.760 align:middle line:84%
These experiences in
the cycles of life

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:84%
create a tension
between contraries.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And this tension is what drives
the transformational process.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:84%
It is like an engine for
transformation and alchemy

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Through the unity of the
two, spiritual and physical,

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:49.310 align:middle line:84%
and through the dynamic
cycles of energy flowing

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:55.070 align:middle line:84%
between masculine and feminine,
transformation can happen.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
If we were only physical,
then no transformation

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.270 align:middle line:90%
would take place.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.530 align:middle line:84%
We'd just decay, as the
physical body is mortal.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And this physical
density brings death.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:84%
It is the spirit
that brings life.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.470 align:middle line:84%
But if we were only
pure spirit, then

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
no transformation would
take place either.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:20.240 align:middle line:84%
We'd just exist in a state of
oneness and eternal beingness,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.580 align:middle line:90%
as the spirit is eternal.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.790 align:middle line:84%
It is through the
union of the two

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.996 align:middle line:90%
that transformation can happen.

00:22:26.996 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And transformation
means progression

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
towards actualizing our
full divine potential.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
This union of
physical and spiritual

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity for
progression that it brings

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
is possible because
of the soul body.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The soul is what
mediates the energies

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:90%
between physical and spiritual.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.340 align:middle line:84%
The soul is composed
of both parts

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and is created from their
union at first breath.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
We've discussed
the soul at length.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.580 align:middle line:84%
For this discussion,
what is important

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.090 align:middle line:84%
is that the soul is what
grants us the ability to be

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:90%
conscious while in this body.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.490 align:middle line:84%
It is also the
vehicle through which

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:15.380 align:middle line:84%
we can learn higher knowledge
and reason in abstract ways.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Hermes said that
we humans have been

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.830 align:middle line:84%
given the gift of consciousness,
reason, and understanding.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:26.330 align:middle line:84%
These are gifts of the mind
which works through the soul.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Our soul learns from both our
physical life and our spirit

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is what can
traverse both the real

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.060 align:middle line:90%
and imaginary dimensions.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:43.040 align:middle line:84%
In kabbalah, the soul consists
of six out of the 10 spheres

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.660 align:middle line:90%
on the tree of life.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.570 align:middle line:84%
The physical body is
the very bottom one,

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:84%
represented by a
circle, while the spirit

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is at the top,
represented by a triangle.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.430 align:middle line:84%
All the other levels in between
are soul, represented here

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.490 align:middle line:90%
by a square.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.950 align:middle line:84%
As we can see on
the tree of life,

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.330 align:middle line:84%
the soul consists of two
triads, a lower and a higher,

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.520 align:middle line:90%
that make up that square.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:84%
We can call these are lower
self and our higher self.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:84%
The lower self is developed
through our learning

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:90%
in the physical world.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.140 align:middle line:90%
And it contains the personality.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.270 align:middle line:84%
The higher self is
developed through

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual connection.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And it receives
from our divine self

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:84%
as well as from various
angels, spirit guides, masters,

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:90%
and the Holy Spirit.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It learns through our
life in the spirit planes.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And it contains what we call
our individuality, which

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
is a reflection of
our true divine self.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
The goal is for our lower
self to also reflect

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.700 align:middle line:90%
our higher self in a pure way.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.190 align:middle line:84%
When these two
aspects of our soul

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:84%
are in balance and
alignment, then we

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.990 align:middle line:84%
will express our true self
into the physical world.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:07.760 align:middle line:84%
As we do, that light
and life of our spirit

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:84%
will continue to help us
grow, progress, and manifest

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.060 align:middle line:90%
our gifts in this life.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.810 align:middle line:84%
But when they're out of
balance or out of alignment,

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.660 align:middle line:84%
then we get stuck
in certain areas.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:90%
And it slows our progression.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:84%
What causes us to get
stuck or out of alignment?

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Usually it is our
personality and ego.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.500 align:middle line:84%
We too easily get caught up in
the physical aspects of life

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and our outer world
dramas, usually

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
to the detriment of our
spiritual connection

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:90%
and progression.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.750 align:middle line:84%
When we have unresolved
issues from the past

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.470 align:middle line:84%
or when we get rooted in
opinions and judgments,

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:58.210 align:middle line:84%
this clouds our soul, creating
blockages and attachments.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Hermes said the two greatest
diseases of the soul

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
are godlessness
and mere opinion.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.840 align:middle line:84%
These are what get
us stuck in life.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:84%
They create friction or
resistance to the light

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:90%
as it moves through our soul.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And this slows down our
transformational process.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.830 align:middle line:84%
It slows down the rotation
of our tree of life.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:84%
The speed of rotation equals
the speed of transformation.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.630 align:middle line:90%
How do we speed it up?

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, through harnessing
consciousness.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:35.500 align:middle line:84%
To do this, we must rise
above our personalities,

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.620 align:middle line:84%
let go of our
attachments and opinions,

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
heal our wounds of the past, and
reconnect with our higher self,

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:90%
the higher aspects of our soul.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Then we go even further than
that to reclaim our divinity,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to reawaken the divine
spark within us.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.350 align:middle line:84%
In universal
kabbalah, we call this

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:84%
the journey of ascending
the tree of life

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:90%
to reclaim our crown.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a journey of learning
to harness our higher

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.930 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and fan the
flames of the secret fire

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:90%
within our soul.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
The brighter our flame
becomes, the more

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:84%
we can wield the four
pillars of our tree of life

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:19.125 align:middle line:90%
and speed up their rotation.

00:27:19.125 --> 00:27:22.520 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, alchemy, Hermetics,
and other ancient mystery

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.550 align:middle line:84%
school lineage
teachings hand down

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
to initiates various advanced
spiritual practices that

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.850 align:middle line:84%
accelerate this
process and empower us

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.520 align:middle line:84%
to harness the
secret fire within.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
We experience our tree of life
become more activated, alive,

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:90%
and flowing.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Our DNA potential and our
atomic weight, or hado,

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.530 align:middle line:90%
turn on at higher levels.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Our transformation and
progression speed up.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
The more transformation
speeds up,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:59.030 align:middle line:84%
the more we can not only keep up
with the pace of today's world,

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:90%
but we can thrive in life.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And we can surf the
wave from the leading

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:10.840 align:middle line:84%
edge of transformation rather
than getting pummeled by it.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Our world is going
through a radical shift

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.610 align:middle line:90%
that this time on the planet.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And the human
collective is being

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.660 align:middle line:84%
pushed to make a leap
in consciousness.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.510 align:middle line:84%
It is far better
that we learn how

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:84%
to surf this wave
of transformation

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:90%
than get swept up by it.

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:28.470 align:middle line:84%
The gradual awakening
of consciousness

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.250 align:middle line:84%
is a far gentler and more
sustainable way to go.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And only by doing the work do
we master our consciousness.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:40.140 align:middle line:84%
It is a way of life, not
just a weekend practice.

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Mastering our consciousness
means learning to control

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.790 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts, emotions,
energy fields, the elements,

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:51.000 align:middle line:84%
all aspects of our
soul's operating system,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:84%
and the movement and
balance of the four

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.420 align:middle line:90%
pillars of our tree of life.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.510 align:middle line:84%
This is not
something that can be

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.980 align:middle line:84%
done to us by some outside
stimulus, device, or drug.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.370 align:middle line:84%
This is only
something we can learn

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to do for ourselves
using the right tools

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.670 align:middle line:84%
and methods to harness
our inner gifts

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and the levels of
our mind and soul.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:84%
The right tools and methods are
what the mystery schools teach

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.570 align:middle line:84%
initiates how to use as
well as what pitfalls

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to watch out for so that
we can walk the direct path

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:84%
rather than getting
lost in the maze.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to always
be transforming?

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes, actually.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:84%
If we are not progressing,
then we are regressing.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.850 align:middle line:90%
There is no standing still.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.460 align:middle line:84%
As soon as we get
into a comfort zone,

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.160 align:middle line:84%
the current of
physical life will

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.670 align:middle line:84%
start to drag us
backwards downstream.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.180 align:middle line:84%
But our full potential is
at the top of the mountain.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.740 align:middle line:90%
It's upstream.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So we must work
and apply ourselves

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:90%
to make our way to the peak.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.090 align:middle line:84%
We must do away with
the comfort zone.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.280 align:middle line:90%
The comfort zone is our enemy.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Magic and progression
in life are always

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to be found outside
the comfort zone.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it takes effort.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.070 align:middle line:84%
There are challenges
that must be overcome.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And we need to cultivate
endurance and devotion

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
to the journey, to the
great work of achieving

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.110 align:middle line:84%
our full potential and
the unique purpose we

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.090 align:middle line:90%
are each here to fulfill.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.880 align:middle line:84%
This is all part
of our contribution

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:35.170 align:middle line:84%
to make the collective shift
and serving the greater mission

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:37.570 align:middle line:90%
of world peace and prosperity.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.750 align:middle line:84%
By meeting those
challenges head-on

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.540 align:middle line:84%
and making that
effort ongoingly,

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:90%
we strengthen our will.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:84%
We learn to master our ego and
align with our higher self.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.990 align:middle line:84%
This strengthening
of our will is

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:84%
part of the key to
giving us the power

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.350 align:middle line:90%
to harness our secret fire.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:02.980 align:middle line:84%
With all this dynamic activity
and meeting challenges,

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.230 align:middle line:84%
it's natural that we
will get thrown off

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.200 align:middle line:84%
balance here and there,
especially when we're living

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.480 align:middle line:90%
outside the comfort zone.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And then there are times
when this might feel

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.820 align:middle line:90%
like it's too much to handle.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.270 align:middle line:84%
These are times when we
need to re-center in order

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.710 align:middle line:90%
to re-establish balance.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.500 align:middle line:90%
How do we find that center?

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:90%
The center is stillness.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It is beingness
or I AM presence.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a state of
pure inner awareness.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And it is found by
closing our eyes

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and creating an
experience of stillness,

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.900 align:middle line:90%
even emptiness within.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
At the center is
the divine spark.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:52.910 align:middle line:84%
It is the middle pillar where
the celestial fire from source

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:58.340 align:middle line:84%
flows down through our center
and into our soul and body.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:84%
This divine spark at
the center is something

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that we, as conscious
and aware beings,

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.340 align:middle line:84%
can tap into through stillness
and centering ourselves.

00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:15.620 align:middle line:84%
As we do, we access
pure light from source,

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.290 align:middle line:90%
the essence of eternal life.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We can bathe in the bliss of
that pure light for a while

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and let it fill us, let
it restore us to balance.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
But we can't just stay
there and bliss out

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.130 align:middle line:84%
if we want to be part of the
mission of the great work.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.740 align:middle line:84%
We need to flow that
central fire, that

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:42.810 align:middle line:84%
divine spark out into our cycle
of life, out into the world.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:48.080 align:middle line:84%
We need to direct it to touch
matter and thereby transform

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.690 align:middle line:90%
it and raise the vibration.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Let it touch other
people's souls

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and remind them of
their own divine spark.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.290 align:middle line:84%
This is how we make a
difference in the world,

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:03.080 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that
is truly in service

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to others and to the great
work of our collective shift.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The more we become
adept at accessing

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.880 align:middle line:84%
that divine spark in the
center and then flowing it out

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
into the physical,
the more we will

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.950 align:middle line:84%
progress towards
atomic consciousness

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.860 align:middle line:84%
where we can consciously
control out atoms.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Being able to
control our atoms is

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:84%
like having that Midas touch
or Philosopher's Stone, where

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.340 align:middle line:84%
we can reach out and
touch other materia

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and instantly activate the
divine spark within it,

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.460 align:middle line:84%
reminding it of its true
source and eternal nature.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
For ultimately,
as Hermes taught,

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.330 align:middle line:84%
there is one soul, one
life, and one matter.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.860 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.150 align:middle line:84%
We are all in this
together, or as we

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.670 align:middle line:84%
might say in quantum
physics terminology,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.340 align:middle line:84%
we are all entangled
and connected.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:84%
We are all part of an
undivided wholeness.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And while we are
all one already,

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:09.320 align:middle line:84%
being able to consciously access
that divine spark is something

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:90%
we must cultivate.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Cultivating it is about learning
to create a state of coherence

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.139 align:middle line:84%
and holding that for
extended periods.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.530 align:middle line:84%
A coherent state is one
that is well-centered

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.840 align:middle line:84%
on the middle pillar,
with all the four

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.280 align:middle line:84%
pillars rotating smoothly
around us in a balanced way.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.889 align:middle line:84%
The tree rotates
clockwise around us

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:38.870 align:middle line:84%
while we stay balanced and
centered in the middle pillar.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:41.060 align:middle line:90%
How do we stay balanced?

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.620 align:middle line:84%
The only way to maintain that
state of coherence or balance

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.050 align:middle line:84%
on the middle pillar is
by learning to equilibrate

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.409 align:middle line:90%
the contraries of life.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.719 align:middle line:84%
This is part of our task
in the physical life.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah gives us many tools
for this, tools for life.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Here is one that
everyone can use.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It can be easily adapted
to any path we are on.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.510 align:middle line:84%
This one is an open
eye meditation.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:13.190 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
center of the circle again.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The symbol of the dot in
the center of a circle

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:23.330 align:middle line:84%
is the basis of all mandalas, as
is the squaring of the circle.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:28.300 align:middle line:84%
According to Carl Jung, the
center dot inside the circle

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.230 align:middle line:84%
it is an archetypal symbol
for the divine self or god.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:36.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the point we
should focus on when

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.380 align:middle line:90%
meditating upon any mandala.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.830 align:middle line:84%
When we focus on the
center of a mandala,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.880 align:middle line:84%
it brings us to stillness
or emptiness within.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.370 align:middle line:84%
This helps us to
reorient ourself.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.646 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:51.646 --> 00:36:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It is much like the North
Star that ancient explorers

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.990 align:middle line:90%
used for navigating.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.900 align:middle line:84%
As the Earth rotates,
the stars in the sky

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:84%
trace out many concentric
circles, with the North Star

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.390 align:middle line:90%
as the center.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:31.170 align:middle line:84%
This is very similar to the
ancient kabbalistic depiction

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.600 align:middle line:84%
of the 10 spherot
when they originally

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.445 align:middle line:90%
emanated out from the Ein Sof.

00:36:35.445 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:90%


00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this
episode, we've talked

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.800 align:middle line:84%
about different
ways of exploring

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.580 align:middle line:84%
the nature of consciousness
beyond the hologram

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.970 align:middle line:84%
into the implicate order,
the undivided wholeness

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
or imaginary nature, the
greater realm where spirit

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.780 align:middle line:90%
and matter unite and are one.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And we've explored
ways to access

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:04.360 align:middle line:84%
the center, the divine
spark of our eternal being.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.920 align:middle line:84%
What might the substance
of this eternal realm be?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung said it
was the archetypes.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But he also said that
the archetypes are just

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:18.550 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the one self.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, in kabbalah,
the one source, Ein Sof,

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:27.340 align:middle line:84%
sends out 144,000
rays from itself.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Each of these raised could
be called an archetype.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:84%
But they are much
more than that.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:90%
They are forces of creation.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.150 align:middle line:84%
They bring order as
well as diversity

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.500 align:middle line:84%
so that the
magnificence of the one

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.380 align:middle line:84%
can be expressed
through the many,

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.970 align:middle line:84%
thereby coming to know itself
and its infinite potential.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:55.210 align:middle line:84%
This one, the substance of the
eternal realm, is divine will.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:59.830 align:middle line:84%
We can also call it light,
love, spirit, intelligence,

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.700 align:middle line:84%
pure awareness, or
the celestial fire.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.980 align:middle line:84%
This divine will is universal,
eternal, and infinite.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It is unity experienced through
its multiple expressions

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.150 align:middle line:90%
in the world, through us.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:19.120 align:middle line:84%
As this will flows
through us, it

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:23.110 align:middle line:84%
is manifested in different
ways, because our way

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:90%
of relating to it is unique.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.870 align:middle line:90%
We are each a unique expression.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:84%
But only when our soul is
aligned with our spirit

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.530 align:middle line:84%
and balanced in
the middle pillar

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.610 align:middle line:84%
do we truly flow this
will in a pure way.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Our imbalances or
blocks to the light

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.430 align:middle line:84%
can distort the expression
of our divinity.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Thus we must seek
to purify our soul,

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.190 align:middle line:84%
attain higher levels
of consciousness,

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:55.840 align:middle line:84%
and increase awareness of
our multi-dimensionality.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.890 align:middle line:84%
As we do, we heal, we
transform and progress.

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:03.080 align:middle line:90%


00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:06.980 align:middle line:84%
By strengthening our ability
to align with that will

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:84%
and by mastering the way
we apply in our life,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.370 align:middle line:84%
we then stand in the
center and direct

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:90%
the forces of transformation.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The divine spark,
once we connect to it,

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.360 align:middle line:90%
is directed by will alone.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.380 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we dive
into more practical ways

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.370 align:middle line:84%
for harnessing the forces of
transformation, such as energy,

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:33.400 align:middle line:90%
time, space, and momentum.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.870 align:middle line:90%
I am Dr. Theresa Bullard.
