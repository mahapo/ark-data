00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.130 align:middle line:84%
Where are we in the
process of humanity's

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.412 align:middle line:90%
collective evolution?

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:10%
Well, from an
alchemical perspective,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:10%
it appears that we
are at the precipice

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:10%
of making a great shift.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And yet, things are rather
intense in the world today,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and it seems the divide
between opposite interests

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.590 align:middle line:90%
grows starker every day.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, let's step back
from the drama of the details

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and get a bird's eye view
of our world situation

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.440 align:middle line:90%
at an alchemical level.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
In any transformational
process, there's

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
a certain sequence
or flow to it.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
We've explored this
sequence in other episodes

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:90%
on the seven stages of alchemy.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's take a look
at how this applies

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to our collective evolution
and what it reveals

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:90%
as the way to move forward.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Where have we been
getting stuck?

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And what do we need to do
to break through and create

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:90%
a better world?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Human evolution has
been through many rounds

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
of the alchemical
process, but today we're

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
living in a truly
remarkable time.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:84%
We're more connected
than ever before.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.860 align:middle line:10%
Global economies, the
internet, social media

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:10%
are transforming the way
we interact and relate

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:10%
to each other on a global scale.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
In our digital
age, we're exposed

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
to an unprecedented amount
of input and stimulus.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is leading to
rapid change within society.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:90%
Where's this shift taking us?

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
Can we trace the alchemical
process of humanity's evolution

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to where we've come
from, where we are,

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.322 align:middle line:90%
and where we might be going?

00:01:58.322 --> 00:01:59.780 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of
the new Millennium

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
marked an interesting
time in human evolution.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
We entered fully
into the digital age

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
with an era of rapid advances
in technology, so much so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
that the science
fiction of the '90s

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.260 align:middle line:84%
has become the
science fact of today.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:84%
During this time, we've also
experienced an increasing trend

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:84%
towards spiritual awakening
and conscious lifestyle

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:90%
within the masses.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, meditation, tai chi,
and many ancient spiritual

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.260 align:middle line:84%
practices have moved
from the fringes

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:90%
into the mainstream culture.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
We've seen a trend shift towards
more health conscious choices

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
and a push for more
sustainability.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
At the core, this is a shift
towards greater awareness.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're also at a point
in this alchemical cycle that

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
coincides with the
dark night of the soul.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
This is because we're seeing
all the corruption, injustices,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and the ugliness that happens
when our societies are run

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:90%
by fear, prejudice, and greed.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.990 align:middle line:84%
In short, we're having
to face our dark side

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
and overcome our attachments to
old paradigm ways of operating.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
We could say that the
inner demons of humanity

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.550 align:middle line:84%
are really in our
face right now.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
We've launched into
collective conversations

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
about racism, inequality,
sexual imbalance.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Before these things, they were
happening behind the scenes

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:90%
but they were covered up.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.340 align:middle line:84%
But now they're being
exposed and confronted.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because it's now out in the
open, we as a collective

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:90%
are having to address it.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
But rather than judging
and pointing fingers

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
at the evil ones, we
want to truly move

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:90%
through this dark night.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And to do so, we need to
take ownership and recognize

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.610 align:middle line:84%
where any of this
exists within ourselves.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
We need to conquer these
energies within before we can

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.040 align:middle line:90%
really change it in the world.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, this task
may seem daunting.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
But when we take the
approach of an alchemist,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.510 align:middle line:84%
a new vision and
clarity emerges.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
To illustrate this
journey, let's compare it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to the metamorphosis of
a caterpillar becoming

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.560 align:middle line:90%
a butterfly.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning,
the caterpillar

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.800 align:middle line:84%
lives most of its life
consuming and growing fat

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
off of the land, until one day
some kind of internal clock

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:90%
goes off.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And as the caterpillar reaches
a certain level of maturity,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:84%
at this point its normal
function starts slowing down

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.440 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes a struggle
to carry on as usual.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So the caterpillar finds
a nice little spot to rest

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:84%
and spins itself a
comfy little cocoon.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And within this
cocoon, or chrysalis,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
an alchemical process
starts to take place.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.220 align:middle line:84%
It begins with the old
structure of the caterpillar

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
breaking down and going
through a form of death.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
This initial breakdown relates
to the calcination stage

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:90%
of alchemy.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:90%
It's literally digesting itself.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:84%
As the caterpillar's cells
dissolve into a soupy mess,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
it enters into the second
stage of disillusion.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.830 align:middle line:84%
Within our society, we
might compare the old form

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
of the caterpillar to the
structures and institutions

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:84%
born out of the
Industrial Revolution.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.790 align:middle line:84%
These systems dominated our
way of perceiving and operating

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.710 align:middle line:84%
But since the new
Millennium, these structures

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
are starting to
crumble, and we've

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.130 align:middle line:84%
been shifting into
a new paradigm way.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
We see this breakdown happening
within the worlds of finance,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
government, business,
education, and

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:90%
many other societal systems.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Things are really
in flux right now,

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and visionaries of all
fields are literally

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.670 align:middle line:84%
looking for the next
big, disruptive idea.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.040 align:middle line:84%
We want change to
happen, and there's

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of progress being
made behind the scenes.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
But there's also those
who don't want change.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
They want things
to stay the same

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:90%
according to the old paradigm.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.620 align:middle line:84%
We can compare
people within society

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:90%
to the cells of the caterpillar.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people think the old
structure worked just fine

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and that it provided safety,
security, and control.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.460 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knew their
place and their duty.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
These people tend to cling
to that old structure

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.820 align:middle line:90%
and fight for its survival.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Other people feel
the system is flawed

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and are ready to find a
better way of operating.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.550 align:middle line:10%
These are the innovators,
the visionaries,

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:10%
and the change agents who
actively work for progress.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Then we have the people who fall
somewhere in the middle, who

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.090 align:middle line:90%
tend to go with the status quo.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time,
the comfort zone

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
wins out because change requires
a lot of energy and discipline.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But when the comfort zone
gets ripped away from us,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
like what happens in the
calcination stage of alchemy,

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.520 align:middle line:84%
things stop feeling so safe and
the system becomes agitated.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.640 align:middle line:84%
As this breakdown happens
within the caterpillar,

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:84%
the old cells act
like they're dying

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and they go into survival mode.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
At the same time that the old
structure starts breaking down,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
a new type of cell
appears on the scene.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:84%
These new cells are
called imaginal cells,

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
and they start showing
up in greater numbers.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And since they're different
from the old cells,

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:47.490 align:middle line:84%
they're perceived as a
threat to the system.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the old cells think
that the imaginal cells are

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
like a virus, and so they
attack and try to kill them off.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.090 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
cells enter into what

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
we call the separation stage
of the alchemical process.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:84%
The imaginal cells need to
separate out from the old cells

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:90%
in order to survive.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, the caterpillar's
DNA has shifted its expression,

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's putting
out the instructions

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.870 align:middle line:90%
to create more imaginal cells.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
They're part of the
blueprint, as they

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:90%
were from the beginning.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And as more and more
come onto the scene,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:27.270 align:middle line:84%
they start grouping together
and gain strength in numbers.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, at some point the imaginal
cells reach a critical mass.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.520 align:middle line:84%
They realize they
don't have to do

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:90%
and be everything on their own.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.140 align:middle line:84%
They can start to
specialize and create

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:90%
new forms and structures.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.020 align:middle line:84%
This structure is guided by
a clear vision within the DNA

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.260 align:middle line:84%
blueprint, and soon the
form of the butterfly

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:90%
starts taking shape.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to
the conjunction stage

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemical process.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The imaginal cells unite
around this new common vision,

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and the old caterpillar
cells, still clinging

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.540 align:middle line:84%
to the old crumbling
system, start noticing

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:90%
something new is happening.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.010 align:middle line:84%
They see that
whatever's going on

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.430 align:middle line:84%
with those imaginal cells
seems to be working.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And then, some of
the caterpillar cells

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.380 align:middle line:84%
start to jump ship and
join the new system

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.490 align:middle line:90%
by repurposing themselves.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.360 align:middle line:84%
For example, a
digestive cell can still

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.610 align:middle line:90%
function as a digestive cell.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
An immunity cell can still
function as an immunity cell.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
They just need to reorient
into the new system.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And as the caterpillar's
cells assume the tasks

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:84%
that they were designed to
do within this new structure,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.710 align:middle line:84%
this frees up the
imagine all cells

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.423 align:middle line:90%
to now specialize even further.

00:09:45.423 --> 00:09:47.090 align:middle line:84%
They start to form
the new elements that

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:90%
are unique to the butterfly.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Now they start to develop the
wings, the antenna, and so

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.650 align:middle line:90%
forth.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
This harmonizing and
cooperation of opposing elements

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.630 align:middle line:84%
is what the conjunction
stage is all about.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
All of the essential elements
are identified and brought

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:90%
together in harmony.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.060 align:middle line:90%
But we're not done yet.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
If we were to stop the process
here and try to open up

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.670 align:middle line:84%
the chrysalis to help
that butterfly out,

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.850 align:middle line:84%
it would be too premature and
that butterfly would never

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:84%
fly, let alone it
might not even survive.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So the metamorphosis must
continue until that butterfly

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.600 align:middle line:90%
comes to full maturity.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.260 align:middle line:84%
What happens next is that the
old caterpillar cells that

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
fail to align within
the new structure

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
start to dissolve into
the alchemical soup

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.630 align:middle line:90%
and eventually die off.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:84%
This alchemical
soup then becomes

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:84%
what fuels the newly
emerging system until it

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:90%
reaches a state of maturity.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to the
fermentation stage of alchemy.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.810 align:middle line:84%
It's both a maturing of the new
form and a death of the old.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:84%
To ferment something means to
allow it to mature to the point

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.260 align:middle line:84%
where anything that is
corruptible rots away.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And in this stage, we're
forced to go deeper and address

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.660 align:middle line:84%
some of the core structures
and impurities remaining

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:90%
on more subtle levels.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.940 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's not aligned
with the purest essence must go.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
This includes the remnants
of the old structure,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.595 align:middle line:84%
with its corruption
and limitations.

00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you can imagine,
it takes a lot more effort

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:84%
to root out those
subtle impurities

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%
and corrupt elements.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
The secret to
moving this process

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
along is to introduce
a gentle heat.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.180 align:middle line:84%
For the butterfly, it's the
heat of the sun or an incubator

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:90%
gently warming the chrysalis.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
For us, it's fueled by the fires
of devotion and higher ideal

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.470 align:middle line:90%
to that greater vision.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It takes discipline,
patience, and dedication

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to make it through
this stage, though.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:84%
How do we know when the
fermentation stage is done?

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the metamorphosis
of the butterfly,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
this would be when the wing
structures in all their beauty

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.940 align:middle line:84%
can be seen clearly
within the chrysalis.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The new structure is no
longer just a vision,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:84%
but now it has taken
on a physical form

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.860 align:middle line:90%
within the alchemical soup.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the proverbial light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
From here on out, everything
that remains is essential

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and the work moves on towards
refinement and elevation.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.250 align:middle line:84%
As everything aligns
around this new structure,

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the butterfly is ready to
break out of the chrysalis.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:84%
But the process is
still not complete.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
The struggle to break
free is a critical step.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Through this struggle,
the butterfly

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:90%
strengthens its wings.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, if we were to
assist the butterfly out,

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:84%
the wings wouldn't be strong
enough to take flight.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So we must allow it to struggle
and become strong on its own.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:84%
This stage of the
butterfly's metamorphosis

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:84%
can be compared to
the alchemical stage

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:17.590 align:middle line:90%
of distillation.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a stage of
re-ordering and refinement.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But in this stage, we're
no longer treating things

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.400 align:middle line:90%
at just the physical level.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's because
to distill something

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.840 align:middle line:84%
is to take whatever
emerges from the ferment

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and then dissolve it
into an aqueous solution,

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.720 align:middle line:84%
and then heat it
so that it rises up

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.300 align:middle line:90%
into the air as a vapor.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
The evaporated essence
rises to the subtle realms,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
infusing consciousness
into the materia.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
And then it re-condenses to
anchor those subtle energies

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.710 align:middle line:90%
back into tangible form.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:84%
Distillation requires
several cycles,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.340 align:middle line:84%
infusing more and more spirit
essence into the physical.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Finally, having emerged
victoriously from the chrysalis

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:09.220 align:middle line:84%
and solidified its new form,
the butterfly is ready to fly.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Like the phoenix
rising from the ashes,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.650 align:middle line:84%
the butterfly emerges
from that alchemical soup.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:84%
This is the final
stage of coagulation.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
The butterfly has crystallized
into its final, perfected form,

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and it now graces the
world with its beauty.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:84%
If we're going through our
own collective metamorphosis,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:90%
where are we in this process?

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Are we able to trace our
collective evolution?

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And once we recognize
where we are,

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.120 align:middle line:84%
is there a way to
accelerate this process?

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
Through the study of
nature, alchemists

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:49.720 align:middle line:84%
discovered that the evolutionary
and transformational process

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
is broken down into
these seven stages.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
This is a natural
process that we all

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:90%
go through, all the time.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But when left to nature
alone, it usually

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:84%
takes a long time
for things to evolve.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.680 align:middle line:84%
What we learn from
the alchemists of old

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is how to intentionally
work with nature

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:84%
to harness consciousness
and speed up

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:90%
the evolutionary process.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.240 align:middle line:84%
We've been through many
cycles throughout humanity's

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.720 align:middle line:84%
evolution, but today
we're in the midst

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:84%
of a transformational
cycle that started

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
at the turn of the
new Millennium.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And this cycle is
bringing us into position

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.780 align:middle line:84%
to make a great leap
into a new paradigm.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Using these metaphors of
the butterfly and alchemy,

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.800 align:middle line:84%
we can reorient ourselves with
this transformational process

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and gain clarity about what's
needed to make the leap.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore a few
significant events

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.550 align:middle line:84%
that have been part of our
current cycle of change.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Now as we do this,
let's remember

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.560 align:middle line:84%
to keep our
alchemical lenses on.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.930 align:middle line:84%
We want to look at these
events from the perspective

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of our collective
transformation,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
rather than getting caught
up in the drama of politics

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:90%
or conspiracy theories.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
From the Western
world perspective,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:84%
we experienced a
couple big events

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that acted as catalysts for
this calcination stage that

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.440 align:middle line:90%
started our current cycle.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It started with the dot
com bubble burst in 1999.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And this was soon followed by
the deregulation of the banking

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2001, the
world reeled from the shock

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:90%
of the 9/11 tragedy.

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:84%
This then instigated
the Patriot Act,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
the Department of Homeland
Security, and the "war

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.220 align:middle line:90%
on terror".

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And while this may have
protected the USA's borders

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
from another terrorist
attack, it also

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.610 align:middle line:84%
stripped American citizens
of many rights and privacy.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Wars in the Middle East
led to then more deaths

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and skyrocketing national debts.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Then, intense emotions were
stirred from the breakdown,

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and this moved us into
the disillusion stage.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
People started to
protest, but their voices

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:09.849 align:middle line:84%
were drowned out by mainstream
media and political rhetoric.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:12.730 align:middle line:84%
The system continued to
dissolve as the credit bubble

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.455 align:middle line:84%
burst and the banks
themselves faced bankruptcy.

00:17:16.455 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:84%
The people began to
realize far reaching

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:23.634 align:middle line:84%
corruption and the breakdown
of the old structures.

00:17:23.634 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:84%
The structures that were
meant to be our foundation

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:84%
were not supporting the whole,
and people either rose up

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
or sunk into dismay
and depression.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Disillusion tends to be
an introspective stage.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity
to reflect on what

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.010 align:middle line:90%
is at the root of the issue.

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to be
angry, and another thing

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:90%
to look at what's the cause.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
people started

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.920 align:middle line:84%
to look at the cause
and effect and seek out

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
actions to reorient
us in a new direction.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we saw the rise
of social media platforms,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.630 align:middle line:84%
with Facebook coming onto the
scene in 2004, YouTube in 2005,

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:90%
and Twitter in 2006.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And things started to
shift as people started

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.070 align:middle line:84%
using these platforms as a tool
to self-organize and express

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.405 align:middle line:90%
their voice.

00:18:15.405 --> 00:18:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the social media
revolution gained momentum,

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:84%
fueled primarily by millennials,
self-organizing increased

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and we transitioned into
the separation stage.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Soon, various groups
of similar agendas

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:35.460 align:middle line:84%
started banding together and
found strength in numbers.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.530 align:middle line:84%
We saw the rise
of many movements,

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
from Occupy Wall
Street to the Tea Party

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and libertarian efforts.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And then later came the
alternative energy initiatives,

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Black Lives Matter,
the Time's Up movement,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:90%
and the list goes on and on.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Documentaries have
also abounded,

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
revealing our flawed
systems from politics,

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:58.080 align:middle line:84%
to the food industry, to
medicine and big pharma, and so

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.330 align:middle line:90%
much more.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.930 align:middle line:84%
As things started to
settle down and stabilize

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:09.150 align:middle line:84%
after the Great Recession, we
moved into a conjunction phase.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:11.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the halfway
point where we

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.280 align:middle line:84%
bring the separated
parts back together,

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.860 align:middle line:90%
but in a more synergistic way.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
In this stage, we
may start to have

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:84%
a sense of the new
vision emerging,

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
but it takes focused
effort and dedication

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
to push through these
final three stages.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.030 align:middle line:84%
If we stop here,
we fail to produce

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:90%
sustainable, lasting change.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And we'll backslide and have to
start from the beginning again.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Moving forward requires a
strong sense of devotion

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
to the mission of
creating a better world.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Then 2016 came along and
was a major disruptor year.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.300 align:middle line:10%
Much like the Tower card
of the major Arcana,

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:10%
it was carried by a fervor that
swept much of Western society,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.680 align:middle line:10%
from the US presidential
election, to the Brexit,

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:10%
and many other
world leaders being

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:10%
ousted as the masses rallied
for change one way or another.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And to top it off, we mourned
an unprecedented number

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
of deaths of some of our
favorite modern stars,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.780 align:middle line:90%
musicians, and heroes.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
all of this, we've

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
come face to face with the
shadow side of humanity.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's now out in the open,
no longer hiding in the shadows,

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
forcing us to deal with it.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.510 align:middle line:84%
Like it or not, 2016 onwards
has brought so many things

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:84%
to the surface that it's
catapulted us forward

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:90%
into the fermentation stage.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:84%
The fermentation stage relates
to that final death of the old

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
as the new paradigm
forms are pushed forward

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.080 align:middle line:90%
into a maturing process.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.100 align:middle line:84%
The current unrest will not
just go away on its own.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.170 align:middle line:84%
It's fueled by an inner
fire, a need for change.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We're experiencing now a
deeply rooted inner struggle

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
within the collective
of humanity.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.210 align:middle line:84%
We've entered into a dark
night of the soul period.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.670 align:middle line:84%
In this struggle,
we must face and let

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.520 align:middle line:84%
go of our core
judgments, attachments,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:84%
and outdated values that are not
aligning with the new paradigm

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.080 align:middle line:90%
energies.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
How do we successfully move
through this fermentation

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:90%
phase?

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And is there
anything that we can

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.020 align:middle line:90%
do to accelerate this process?

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.550 align:middle line:84%
There is no doubt that we're
on the verge of a great shift.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:84%
With AI and 3D printing,
automated vehicles

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and sustainable
energy solutions,

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.250 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing
amazing innovations

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.530 align:middle line:84%
at a faster rate
than ever before.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
There's massive potential
to move into a new paradigm

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.620 align:middle line:84%
way of operating and
to solve the biggest

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:90%
problems of our world.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.060 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are
starting to come into focus,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.760 align:middle line:84%
and yet we still see
the old caterpillar

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:90%
cells fighting the process.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
We need to integrate the core
values of the new paradigm

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:90%
and work out the kinks.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.500 align:middle line:84%
As we do this, we can
find a proper flow

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:84%
within an integrated
system, rather

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.000 align:middle line:84%
than establishing a
little piece of it here

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and a little piece of it there.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
To make it through
this shift, it's

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.690 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness that
needs to break free

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:90%
from outmoded programs.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
This is what will take us
from the fermentation stage

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.330 align:middle line:84%
through the final
steps of the process.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The task before us is to
integrate the new paradigm

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
techniques in a way that's
aligned with a higher level

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.150 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness and wisdom.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
To move through this stage
requires soul searching.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.220 align:middle line:84%
We have to turn inwards and let
go of the outer distractions

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and anything that keeps us
caught up in the matrix.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It's time to get in touch with
our inner soul and spirit.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:84%
This is how we can
access the blueprint

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.320 align:middle line:84%
for this new paradigm,
because it's in us.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
It's time for a deep
dive into our inner self

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
and to seek out that
spiritual awakening.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Only when enough of us
do this individually can

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:84%
we then start to
do it collectively.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:84%
If it's up to us as
individuals, where do we start?

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
First off, we have to
recognize where we're

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.780 align:middle line:90%
at in our personal journey.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical
process gives us a map

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to see where we are and shows us
what it takes to move forward.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.060 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to get caught up
in media, and politics, and all

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
the fear and judgment that goes
back and forth in our world

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.440 align:middle line:84%
We're living in what feels like
one of the most highly charged

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and polarized times.

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But alchemy works through
the tension of differences,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.690 align:middle line:84%
so there's a huge
opportunity here as well.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.420 align:middle line:84%
We have the
possibility to harness

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:05.230 align:middle line:84%
this time of high energy
and direct it in a good way.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.770 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do that?

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we return to that
metaphor of the butterfly,

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
the imaginal cells
are the driving force

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:90%
behind this transformation.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.710 align:middle line:84%
They hold a clear vision to
guide the collective shift.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:23.760 align:middle line:84%
So who are the imaginal
cells of today?

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And what new paradigm values
do they innately align with?

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:84%
There are two primary
groups driving this shift

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%
into the new paradigm.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.550 align:middle line:84%
The first are the millennials,
or the net generation,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.830 align:middle line:84%
those who grew up
in the digital age

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and are ready for
that new paradigm.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.430 align:middle line:84%
The millennials value
creativity and innovation,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to have
a degree of skepticism

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:90%
about the mainstream propaganda.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.060 align:middle line:84%
They tend to do
their own research

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and decide for themselves what
they think is really happening.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Growing up digital, their
brains operate in a new way,

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:84%
and they have high
expectations for a faster pace

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.550 align:middle line:90%
and interconnected reality.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Millennials are breaking
out of the old structure

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.730 align:middle line:84%
and pursuing technology-driven
creative solutions

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to the problems of the world.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The second group
of imaginal cells

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
are identified as the
cultural creatives.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.160 align:middle line:84%
Cultural creatives
aren't defined

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:84%
by any particular
demographic, but instead they

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:90%
share a common set of values.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:34.180 align:middle line:84%
These values tend towards
greater sustainability,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.810 align:middle line:84%
acceptance of diversity,
and greater transparency.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.960 align:middle line:84%
They embrace ideas like
conscious consumerism, greater

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.565 align:middle line:90%
cooperation, and altruism.

00:25:42.565 --> 00:25:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.630 align:middle line:84%
The old paradigm, based
on separation, fear,

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:90%
and nationalism, is dying.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.070 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of it
right now, but that's

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:84%
because it's in its
final death throes.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:26:01.540 align:middle line:84%
The way forward is toward
unity, not more separation.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.560 align:middle line:84%
We are a collective,
meaning we are all one.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
It's time for us to
remember and embrace that.

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.530 align:middle line:84%
The cultural creatives
carry these values,

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
and just like the imaginal
cells of the butterfly

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.290 align:middle line:84%
win out in the end, so
too will these values

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.145 align:middle line:90%
of the new paradigm.

00:26:18.145 --> 00:26:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.080 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that we have a role

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.263 align:middle line:90%
to play in this metamorphosis.

00:26:25.263 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And through our
collective effort,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:90%
we can accelerate the shift.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.600 align:middle line:84%
The famous principle of
correspondence that states,

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.930 align:middle line:84%
"as above, so below,
as below, so above".

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
This can also be taken to
mean, as within, so without.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
What this is saying is that
the world reflects our thought

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.600 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we wish to
change the world,

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.250 align:middle line:84%
we must first change
our inner landscape

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:90%
of emotions and thoughts.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
We must slay our
own inner demons

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
and not allow ourselves
to be distracted

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:90%
by outer circumstances.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.240 align:middle line:84%
The battle can only
be won on the inside.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we can
reflect to the outer.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So how do we come through
this victoriously?

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the
alchemical process we

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
have four keys that
can help us to move

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.890 align:middle line:84%
through the fermentation
stage and to rise

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.530 align:middle line:90%
from the ashes like the phoenix.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Number one is to move beyond
the emotional attachments,

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.960 align:middle line:90%
opinions, and negative emotions.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Number two, be honest with
ourselves and each other.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Number three, be willing to
sacrifice the ego in order

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.970 align:middle line:84%
to attain a higher
purpose and glory.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And number four, connect to
the universal spiritual source

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:48.220 align:middle line:84%
to guide, fuel, and refine
our ongoing transformation.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Accomplishing these
four steps requires

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:54.070 align:middle line:84%
us to face our own darkness and
do some soul searching to get

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:90%
clear about our core values.

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:01.160 align:middle line:84%
The first step is to move
beyond the emotional energy.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.040 align:middle line:84%
This includes the
reactive emotions

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.530 align:middle line:84%
that drove us to speak
out against the corruption

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It's so important that we
let go of our anger, sadness,

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and dissatisfaction
with the system.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Why is this such
a necessary step?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we refuse to let go
of these emotional attachments,

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:23.080 align:middle line:84%
we get stuck in pointing the
finger and blaming others.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And we don't take responsibility
for our own actions.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:84%
These emotions, they're
a natural response

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.650 align:middle line:90%
to the calcification phase.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.290 align:middle line:84%
But if we hold on to
them, they drive us

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
into this emotional drama
that just keeps us stuck.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:44.210 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to get addicted to the
drama and stop moving forward.

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:90%
So how do we let go?

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.780 align:middle line:84%
The disillusion stage is meant
to give us an opportunity

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.660 align:middle line:84%
to discharge this
emotional build-up,

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.565 align:middle line:84%
to feel, express, and let
go of that emotional energy.

00:28:56.565 --> 00:29:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And what follows is a
greater sense of clarity.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:84%
You can think of
the "e" in emotion

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.530 align:middle line:90%
as standing forward Energy.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.620 align:middle line:84%
Emotions are energy that
need to be in motion.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, emotions need
to be actively moved through,

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:18.630 align:middle line:84%
expressed, and grounded in order
to be released and dissipated.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Once we move beyond
the emotional energy,

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:24.990 align:middle line:84%
key number to challenges
us to face the truth

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
and be honest with
ourselves and each other.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Usually this also
involves key number three,

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:84%
which is letting go of
our pride, righteousness,

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:90%
and self-centered point of view.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Only then will we be
able to acknowledge

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
our own shortcomings
and accept and open up

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to the possibility of
other perspectives.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.600 align:middle line:84%
This is how we start to realize
creative solutions that get us

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.880 align:middle line:90%
out of the mess we've created.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Telling ourselves
the truth means

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:84%
recognizing the places where
we've been part of the problem.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Since ancient times,
philosophers and sages

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.800 align:middle line:84%
have taught that
the world outside

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.250 align:middle line:84%
is simply a reflection of what's
happening within each of us.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to do the
work to purify ourselves

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:84%
so that we can then make
the change on the outside.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
what's happening out there

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and what those people
are doing wrong.

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It's about what's
happening in us.

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:84%
The alchemist and
their experiments

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.490 align:middle line:84%
are not viewed as
separate, but are

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
seen as intimately
connected or entangled.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Any change that the alchemist
wants to see in their subject,

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.110 align:middle line:84%
such as the world outside, they
must first realize that change

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:90%
within themselves.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Only then can they create
that change in the world.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:84%
If we want to create
a golden society,

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.760 align:middle line:84%
we must first attain the gold
within our own hearts, minds,

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:90%
and souls.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.680 align:middle line:84%
The inner gold is the
attainment of wisdom

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and the awakening of
our full potential.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.100 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to
the fourth key,

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:84%
connecting to the
universal spiritual source

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to guide, fuel, and refine
our ongoing transformation.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.500 align:middle line:84%
This divine source is the
secret fire of alchemists,

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.290 align:middle line:84%
and it can only be
cultivated within oneself

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:17.390 align:middle line:90%
through spiritual devotion.

00:31:17.390 --> 00:31:20.140 align:middle line:84%
True alchemical
work starts within,

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and from there it moves
out into the world.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that we need
more people doing the work,

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:84%
getting initiated, and
committing to their journey.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.640 align:middle line:84%
If we're going to make this
shift on a larger scale,

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.250 align:middle line:84%
about 3% of the
population is needed

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:84%
to create that
major tipping point.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.050 align:middle line:84%
This is our critical
mass level needed

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.960 align:middle line:84%
for a spontaneous evolution
and the up-leveling

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.090 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:51.750 align:middle line:84%
3% of the population
may seem daunting.

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that
we don't need to reach

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:90%
that many people to begin with.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We just need to reach
the right people who

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.260 align:middle line:84%
can be the ones
to tip the scales

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that lead towards the
snowballing effect to take us

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.490 align:middle line:90%
to the tipping point.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:84%
In Malcolm Gladwell's
book, "The Tipping Point",

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.390 align:middle line:84%
he talks about three
types of people

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that are at the core
of any social movement.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
These are the types of people
that we need to find and bring

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.380 align:middle line:90%
toward this level of awareness.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So if you might be one
of those, or if you

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.890 align:middle line:84%
know of anyone who fits
these characteristics,

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.590 align:middle line:84%
then introduce them to these
teachings and concepts.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:84%
These people are different
types of influencers

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.070 align:middle line:84%
who can help us reach
the tipping point faster.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of you watching
it fit these categories

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.240 align:middle line:90%
or you know who do.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Who are they?

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first group
he calls the connectors.

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Connectors are naturally social
and they love to meet people.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.710 align:middle line:84%
They're incredibly
charismatic, and good all kinds

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.960 align:middle line:84%
of social interactions,
and they enjoy

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.850 align:middle line:84%
the process of randomly
getting to know people

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and then will maintain
those connections.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Connectors also love helping
you connect to the right people

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.860 align:middle line:90%
in their inner circle.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Now the second group
he terms as the mavens.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Mavens are social, but they're
more information oriented.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.040 align:middle line:84%
They seek out knowledge
in a variety of topics

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and will learn the ins, and
outs, and all the details.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.430 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones who dive
in to do the research

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and find out where
to go, what to buy,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.030 align:middle line:84%
and where you're really
going to get your best value.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.970 align:middle line:84%
They love to do this research
and then make recommendations

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:90%
for other people.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can trust them because
you know that they've really

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.610 align:middle line:90%
done their homework.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Mavens love connecting
you to the right resources

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:46.290 align:middle line:84%
or information that you
need to make wise decisions.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.750 align:middle line:84%
The third group are
called persuaders.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.390 align:middle line:84%
This group is really
good at sales, but not

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.850 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
agenda or pushiness.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.150 align:middle line:84%
They truly want to serve
people, and they really

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.930 align:middle line:84%
like to help people find
solutions to their problems.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.310 align:middle line:84%
They may represent a
certain product or service,

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and this is something that
they usually truly believe in.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they're really
good at persuading

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and helping people make the
right decision to invest.

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
Now, Gladwell talks about all
of this from the perspective

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.260 align:middle line:90%
of marketing and business.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.389 align:middle line:84%
But we can take
these same principles

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:84%
and apply it towards
generating a shift

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.650 align:middle line:90%
in collective consciousness.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:27.590 align:middle line:84%
These social drivers
can help move us forward

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.380 align:middle line:84%
through our process
of social alchemy.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to find the
right people who

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.250 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
instrumental in pushing us

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:36.980 align:middle line:90%
toward that critical mass.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Those few aren't going
to be the critical mass,

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:42.860 align:middle line:84%
but they'll help us generate
momentum towards it.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Once we reach the
critical mass level,

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.350 align:middle line:84%
we reach the tipping point
for a spontaneous awakening

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:52.290 align:middle line:84%
within the collective
of humanity.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:54.929 align:middle line:84%
One thing we can do is to
identify the right people

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:58.860 align:middle line:84%
to talk to who can then be
those connectors, influencers,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.065 align:middle line:90%
and persuaders.

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And as they get turned on, that
brings the right people forward

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to help us reach
that tipping point.

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Now regardless of who
you know or who you are,

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:13.420 align:middle line:84%
we all still have a role
to play in this process.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you're a
Gaia subscriber, you

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:19.210 align:middle line:84%
can count yourself among the
imaginal cells of humanity.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:23.510 align:middle line:84%
What we need to get clear
about is, what is our piece?

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.260 align:middle line:84%
As an imaginal
cell, are you here

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:28.470 align:middle line:84%
to be an antenna to
help us navigate?

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Are you here to be part of
the wing to help us fly?

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Are you a color to bring
beauty and artistry?

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.730 align:middle line:84%
What's your role within
the structure of the whole?

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Every cell has a part
to play, and we have

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.970 align:middle line:90%
to get clear what it is for us.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.070 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that's innate within us.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
we were born to do.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We need to get clear
on who we really are

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and be willing to do the work
it takes to fulfill that role.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But it also takes
coordination with other cells

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.640 align:middle line:84%
who work with a similar
part of the structure.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.520 align:middle line:10%
We meet others who are on
a similar mission, and bond

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.830 align:middle line:10%
together, and create
something bigger than what

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:10%
we can create our own.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:11.205 align:middle line:90%
And we find that group synergy.

00:36:11.205 --> 00:36:13.800 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Then our task is to become
the best that we can be.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Start shedding our
old skin and letting

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.350 align:middle line:84%
go of the old paradigm
ways in our own life.

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.840 align:middle line:84%
As we go through our own
personal transformation,

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.520 align:middle line:90%
the outer shift can happen.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.400 align:middle line:84%
We want to be ready
so that we can

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.480 align:middle line:90%
be an active part of the shift.

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.580 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that humanity
is right now standing

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.480 align:middle line:84%
at the precipice
of a great abyss,

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.960 align:middle line:84%
and we're in the final
face-off with our dark side.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.610 align:middle line:84%
We're searching for a way
across into the new paradigm.

00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:52.250 align:middle line:84%
The most critical element
is that we pass through

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.160 align:middle line:84%
without giving up or
being dragged down

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.770 align:middle line:84%
into this bottomless
pit of fear, separation,

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.630 align:middle line:90%
and negativity.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.690 align:middle line:84%
How do we navigate
crossing this abyss?

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've learned
from neuroscience

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.730 align:middle line:84%
that our thoughts and
feeling directly impact

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.250 align:middle line:90%
the creation of our reality.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.400 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to choose
hope and to align

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.910 align:middle line:84%
with positive perspectives
to keep moving forward,

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:20.480 align:middle line:84%
no matter how bad and
dark it might seem.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.940 align:middle line:84%
As the saying goes,
"the darkest hour

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.970 align:middle line:90%
comes just before the dawn".

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.280 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that this
dark night of the soul

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.100 align:middle line:84%
is something that we're
experiencing collectively,

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
but it also manifests itself
in our individual lives.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
anger, and fear,

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to just check out or
give up happening in the world.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's also this
other part of us that says,

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.580 align:middle line:90%
no I will never give up.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.250 align:middle line:84%
I will continue forward
no matter what it takes.

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So call upon your
inner warrior of light

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and your inner servant of light,
and let's keep moving forward

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.500 align:middle line:90%
across this abyss.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we
explore ways to move

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
through the dark
night of the soul

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and break through to
a more joyful life.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring the
mysteries of social alchemy

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:15.620 align:middle line:84%
with me in this episode
of "Mystery Teachings."

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.000 align:middle line:90%
