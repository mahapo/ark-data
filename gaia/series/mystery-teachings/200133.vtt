00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.333 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:10%
On my journey in the
Mystery School tradition,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:10%
especially through the
Kabbalistic teachings,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.260 align:middle line:10%
one of the many books
we reference and study

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.348 align:middle line:10%
is the "Sepher Yetzirah."

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.640 align:middle line:84%
When you read it, it's not
one of those kinds of things

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
that you just pick up
and read cover to cover.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a book that requires deep
contemplation, meditation,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 align:middle line:90%
and discussion.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And through the
oral teachings, we

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.450 align:middle line:90%
can really start to unpack it.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The "Sepher Yetzirah" is
actually a very small book.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.210 align:middle line:90%
It's only like 12 pages.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And yet, those 12 pages contain
volumes of mystery teachings.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And throughout my 20 years
of studying Kabbalah,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I've read it many times over
and deeply studied its passages.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
The more I grow on this path
and through exploring the deeper

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
teachings of
Kabbalah, the more I

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:84%
am able to discover through
the "Sepher Yetzirah."

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.090 align:middle line:84%
But at first, it
was such an enigma--

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:90%
a perplexing mystery.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm someone who likes
to solve riddles.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And the "Sepher Yetzirah"
is definitely a riddle.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously coded,
but it's not just a code.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
It's also giving us formulas.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.930 align:middle line:84%
It talks about creation
and also about alchemy

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.000 align:middle line:90%
but without using those terms.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of mysteries are
revealed within this "Sepher

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:90%
Yetzirah."

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:90%
So what's it revealing to us?

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Well it's formulas for how to
apply these mysteries in a very

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:90%
magical way in our lives.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
For me personally,
it was like getting

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.980 align:middle line:84%
a multi-dimensional
puzzle to solve.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of working
with it and contemplating it,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.420 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to expand
our mind and the way

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:84%
that we operate, coming to
more multi-dimensional ways

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.380 align:middle line:90%
of operation.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It gives us the keys to
creation and manifestation.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
So let's dive in and experience
a taste of the "Sepher

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Yetzirah," the book of
formation, and some of the ways

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that we use it in
the mystery teachings

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:90%
of universal Kabbalah.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.840 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.610 align:middle line:84%
The "Sepher Yetzirah" is one of
the oldest and most mysterious

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Kabbalistic texts.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
The first written
commentaries were

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.052 align:middle line:84%
published in the 10th
century, but the teachings

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:31.760 align:middle line:84%
of the "Sepher Yetzirah"
have been around

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.008 align:middle line:84%
There are different translations
and interpretations of it.

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.050 align:middle line:84%
In the Mystery School
tradition that I come from,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.390 align:middle line:84%
we work with the version
translated by William Wynn

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Westcott, which highlights
more of the alchemical nature

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.540 align:middle line:90%
of this text.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.470 align:middle line:84%
From it, we see that the "Sepher
Yetzirah" is an incredible code

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.560 align:middle line:84%
for understanding the
density levels of spirit

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and how they come
into the physical.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
most amazing guides

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.467 align:middle line:84%
for alchemical and magical
operations ever written.

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about helping us
in our own progression

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:84%
towards becoming a higher
being, towards attaining

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.350 align:middle line:84%
the perfected state of the Adam
Kadmon or the divine human.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.150 align:middle line:10%
The "Sepher Yetzirah"
starts off by saying,

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:10%
"In 32 wonderful paths of wisdom
did the Source engrave his name

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.500 align:middle line:10%
by 3 Seraphim--

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.700 align:middle line:10%
numbers, letters, and sounds."

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:84%
These are tools
or building blocks

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
used to create the
32 paths of wisdom

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:90%
that we humans can receive.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:90%
How do we receive this gift?

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, it says here that
the divine creator engraved

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
his name, but where
is it engraved?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's in our DNA.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Our tree of life is
the 32 paths of wisdom.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the sacred geometry
blueprint or scaffolding

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%
of our DNA.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But here when we're
talking about the DNA,

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:84%
we're not talking about the
physical DNA necessarily.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
sacred geometry blueprints

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.310 align:middle line:84%
prior to the physical
coming into being,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
not the DNA within
the cells of the body

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
in this physical flesh, but
within the tree of life that

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:90%
was the original DNA blueprint.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to understand
about the numbers and letters

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.660 align:middle line:84%
here is that they're not what
we normally think of as a number

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:90%
or a letter in the usual sense.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
These are more about
rays of creation.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And each ray has a unique
frequency, a purpose,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.500 align:middle line:90%
and an essence.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:10%
And on the overall pattern
of the tree of life,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:10%
the numbers form the core
anchor points or the spheres,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:10%
while each letter
corresponds to a pathway that

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.820 align:middle line:10%
connects two spheres.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Letters can be thought
of as archetypes.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And each letter represents
a transformation

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
from one state of
being to another.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:84%
They all have an
intelligence behind them.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, they're even
like angelic-type beings

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:90%
unto themselves.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, within any one
number or letter,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
there's far more information
that we could unpack.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.730 align:middle line:84%
We could talk about any one
of them for a whole day.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk about
numbers, letters, and sounds,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
we're not just
talking about language

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:90%
or abstract mathematics.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the
fundamental building

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.305 align:middle line:90%
blocks of creation.

00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So what are these
numbers and letters?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a closer look.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
The letters are grouped
in different ways.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:10%
They talk about there being
three mothers, seven doubles,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.980 align:middle line:10%
and 12 simple letters,
making 22 altogether.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
The three mothers are called
the foundation to all things.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The seven doubles
are called as such

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.040 align:middle line:84%
because they have a double
meaning and a double sound.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And these relate to polarities
like life and death or war

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.810 align:middle line:90%
and peace.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And we experience
these polarities

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.390 align:middle line:90%
in this physical world.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
The 12 simple letters
usually relate

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
to functions or properties
such as our five

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.780 align:middle line:84%
senses, sexual energy,
movements, imagination.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Their functions are qualities
that we experience here

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:90%
in our physical life.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, even within the
groupings of the letters,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.500 align:middle line:90%
there's a number system--

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
3, 7, 12, 22, 32,
64, and onwards.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And so the numbers are very
important within all of this.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
And what's more is each
letter has a number.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
So if we have a combination
of letters to form a word,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
we can look at the
mathematical value of the word.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is known as gematria.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, some Kabbalists use this
as a way to decode the Torah,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.420 align:middle line:84%
looking at the number
of values of the words.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And where there are words
with the same number value,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.550 align:middle line:84%
they think that there's
then a hidden connection

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:90%
between these words.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
The same thing can be
done with entire passages

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and if they come to
the same number value

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that there would be a hidden
meaning, even if they're

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:84%
in completely different
sections of the Torah.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So the "Sepher Yetzirah"
delivers a science and alchemy

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.160 align:middle line:84%
for these building blocks of
numbers, letters, and sounds

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:84%
and how we can use them
to raise our vibration up

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:90%
to higher levels.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.500 align:middle line:84%
But if we're to dive
into it mathematically,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
some believe we
could even use it

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
to verify different
aspects of creation

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:90%
from a physical perspective.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It even gets into the interplay
of the four elements--

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:84%
for example between
fire and water with air

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:90%
mediating between them.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:84%
That's a very
alchemical conversation.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:90%
And in essence, it's a codex.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
But what exactly are
we deciphering here?

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:84%
The "Sepher Yetzirah" is a coded
manual for how to understand

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:84%
and being connection with what
we might call the communication

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.500 align:middle line:90%
network of the universe.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
That communication is done
through an ancient language.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But the true language here
is not necessarily Hebrew.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
That's one way it's
expressed here.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The true language
of the universe

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:23.530 align:middle line:84%
is frequency and
vibrational energy.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.320 align:middle line:10%
The tree of life is formed
by this coming together

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.950 align:middle line:10%
of these different frequencies
into one nexus or pattern.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And this coming together of
the languages of creation

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:84%
into this pattern allows for
an energetic flow and operation

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.700 align:middle line:84%
And when we have
this understanding

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and know how to use it,
that's what gives us the power

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
to become creator
gods in our own way

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and to realize our own
abilities as divine beings.

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So how can we apply
this to our lives?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, numbers are
something that we traditionally

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.642 align:middle line:90%
associate with mathematics.

00:09:03.642 --> 00:09:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know from
science that mathematics

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
is a universal language
underlying everything

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.690 align:middle line:90%
within our phenomenal world.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Numbers are like a frequency.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a beat or a rhythm.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:84%
It's an electrical
current that runs

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
through us and through our
body and through the cosmos.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
We each have our
own numbers as well.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
We have the number of our
birth date, for example,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we also have
the letters of our name

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.220 align:middle line:90%
which can be reduced to numbers.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And we can identify
those to then come up

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:38.470 align:middle line:84%
with what we call
our personal number.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Even in our astrological
chart, there

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:84%
are numbers and patterns
that can be identified.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And in Kabbalah and
the tree of life,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.750 align:middle line:84%
we look at what
those numbers mean.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Kabbalistic numerology
has a different meaning

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of each number and
in Kabbalah, they

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.230 align:middle line:84%
relate them to where they
fall on the tree of life.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And through those
aspects of the tree,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.810 align:middle line:84%
we can then come
to know ourselves.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And this deepens
our self-knowledge

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:11.030 align:middle line:84%
by understanding our
relationship to those numbers.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
One other way to apply
this is by understanding

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that numbers are one of the ways
the universe can communicate

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.580 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
universal languages.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
we see numbers show up

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
in repetition around
us, this is usually

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
a good indicator and
reminder of the connectedness

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.730 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.272 align:middle line:84%
It's a synchronicity, a
sign to pay attention,

00:10:35.272 --> 00:10:36.730 align:middle line:84%
not only to pay
attention to what's

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.500 align:middle line:84%
going on around or
within our thoughts,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
but also to the
meaning of the numbers.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Notice which number
is being repeated,

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and then we can take a
look at the tree of life

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
to have a deeper
understanding of that number

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:90%
and what to pay attention to.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So the numbers are
frequencies of vibration,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.610 align:middle line:84%
but the letters are
more like archetypes.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.080 align:middle line:84%
They show that there's
power in words.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient magical
traditions of Kabbalah,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.730 align:middle line:90%
words are more like formulas.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Each word is like a
mathematical formula bringing

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:84%
different aspects of creation
or different ingredients

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:84%
together into one mix to
communicate an intention.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.630 align:middle line:84%
But the word has a more
complex pattern of energy

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:90%
that flows through it.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And as that word
gets expressed, it's

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
delivering that
particular energy.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And its vibrational
pattern gets communicated.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So words are a
way that energy is

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
transmitted from a thought
or an idea within the mind.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And that thought is then
spoken or expressed,

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
impacting the physical
and creating a result.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.590 align:middle line:84%
The result is
reflected back to us.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And this helps us to
then see manifestation

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:84%
of that divine
expression and ultimately

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.490 align:middle line:84%
helps us to understand
our own divinity more.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:84%
One way we can think
of it as that numbers

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.090 align:middle line:84%
are like a pure tone
or pure frequency

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
while the letters show a
movement or transformation

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:90%
from one frequency to another.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
And as we bring the letters
together to form words,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like these
intersecting frequency

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.880 align:middle line:90%
waves and scalar waves.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And as they intersect in a
particular pattern or formation

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:84%
of letters, it creates
this complex pattern that

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.010 align:middle line:90%
impresses itself upon materia.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
It then shapes it into a unique
form as that word is spoken.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So what this means
is that each form

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:90%
has a unique name behind it.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.638 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for
all things manifested

00:12:46.638 --> 00:12:47.680 align:middle line:90%
in this physical density.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So how can we use this to
create in our own life?

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we really
need to realize

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.200 align:middle line:84%
is that there's power
in the words we choose

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
and in the speaking
of those words.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.970 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the
words, but it's also

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:10.070 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts behind the words
and the vibrational essence

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that we hold within
ourselves as we speak.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's our responsibility
when using these techniques

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
to control our thoughts and
be mindful of the words we

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
speak so that we're not
creating negative things.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the work that we
do in Kabbalah before we

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
get into that
practical work of using

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.910 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries in the
"Sepher Yetzirah"

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.660 align:middle line:84%
is the first the work
of cleaning up the mind.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The ascension process
with the tree of life

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:84%
helps us gain better control
and mastery over our thoughts,

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:90%
words, and deeds.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And then this brings us back
again to the third key--

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.550 align:middle line:84%
the key of sound, that
vibrational energy

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.832 align:middle line:90%
we use to utter words of power.

00:13:54.832 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient
creation stories

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.260 align:middle line:84%
from different traditions
around the world,

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:03.250 align:middle line:84%
there's always something
about the spoken word,

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:07.090 align:middle line:84%
an outward vibrational
expression such as fiat lux--

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
let there be light.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
This is where those
fire letters move

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
from the idea realm in
the mind to the divine

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and that mathematical
abstract realm

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
into being communicated out
into the universe to influence

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.480 align:middle line:90%
the material realm.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But in order to speak this
language of creation properly,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
we have to have the right
alignment of our vibration

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:90%
inwardly.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.990 align:middle line:84%
We need to be in alignment
with that divine will

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
and correctly utter
the sounds of power.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, getting into
that proper vibration

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:84%
comes down to each
individual getting

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:49.230 align:middle line:84%
into their own natural rhythm
and vibration, for example,

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:53.850 align:middle line:84%
getting their cells and their
DNA fully activated in order

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to attune to those
higher frequencies

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and vibrations of true light.

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
So the "Sepher Yetzirah" says
that the numbers, letters,

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and sounds form to the
32 paths of wisdom.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are these
paths of wisdom?

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:84%
The "Sepher Yetzirah" breaks
this down into two groups.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "10 are
the ineffable Sephiroth.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:90%
22 are the letters."

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
So we had the 10 Sephiroth
and the 22 letters

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that then come together to
form the 32 paths of wisdom.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And this arrangement of 10 and
22 to make 32 is very specific.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:38.020 align:middle line:10%
The "Sepher Yetzirah" even goes
so far as to say, "It's 10,

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:10%
not 9, 10, not 11.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
Understand this wisdom and
be wise in the perception."

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So specifically 10,
and what's interesting

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.520 align:middle line:84%
is that both with 10 and
with 32 is that these

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.740 align:middle line:90%
relate to the number 5.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:90%
And 5 is the number of humans.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Why is 5 considered
the number of humans?

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's written all over us.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:84%
We have five fingers on each
hand, five toes on each foot.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.260 align:middle line:84%
We have five major points within
our body, our hands, our legs,

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.510 align:middle line:90%
our head.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you add the
two sides together,

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
five and five makes
10 fingers, 10 toes.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:90%
These are very specific.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And humans are considered
to be the microcosm

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
of the great pattern of the
universe and the tree of life.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And these same
numbers are in us.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're also
in the universe.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:90%
As above, so below.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.780 align:middle line:90%
As below, so above.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
This is about the
path and helping

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.240 align:middle line:84%
us to see the reflection of
the divine within ourselves.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
It's showing us the
path that we can

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.960 align:middle line:84%
follow to reclaim that
divinity while still being here

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.560 align:middle line:90%
in the physical experience.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:84%
If words are formulas
for creation,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:90%
how are these words applied?

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer
this question, let's

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
look at three of the
simple letters that

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:90%
were selected for creation.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
These three letters
are Yod, He, Vau.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you add then a
second He to the end, which

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
happens elsewhere,
this then becomes

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.849 align:middle line:84%
what's called the
Great Name needed

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to bring the energy down
through the four worlds

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:90%
into the physical plains.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
This great name is
also referred to

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.030 align:middle line:90%
or known as the Tetragrammaton.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And attempts at pronouncing
it have given us

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:37.540 align:middle line:84%
names such as Yehovah,
Java, Yahweh, and so forth.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, these aren't
different beings

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:90%
as some theories like to assert.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:84%
What they are is
different attempts

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
at referencing the
divine name composed

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:90%
of the letters Yod He Vau He.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%
This divine name
is a combination

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.990 align:middle line:84%
of letters that were used
to seal the universe.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
"Sepher Yetzirah" teachings,

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.120 align:middle line:84%
these letters were used to
create the physical container

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:90%
for our universe.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
These letters were
uttered in order

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.780 align:middle line:84%
to carry the energy down
from the spiritual plains

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:84%
What does this mysterious
container look like?

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.740 align:middle line:84%
To answer that, I'd like
to read to you directly

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.840 align:middle line:90%
from the "Sepher Yetzirah."

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
This comes from the
end of chapter 1.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And it was said
that this great name

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:84%
was used to seal the
universe in six directions.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:10%
And it reads, "He looked
above and he sealed the height

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.020 align:middle line:10%
with Yod He Vau.

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:10%
He looked below and he sealed
the depth with Yod Vau He.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:10%
He looked forward and he sealed
the east with He Yod Vau.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:50.080 align:middle line:10%
He looked backward and sealed
the west with Vau He Yod.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:10%
He looked to the right
and sealed the south

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.030 align:middle line:10%
with Vau Yod He.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:10%
And he looked to the left
and sealed the north with He

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:10%
Vau Yod."

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:90%
What does this form?

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, it forms the six
faces of the cube--

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:84%
above, below, east,
west, north, and south,

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.840 align:middle line:84%
and then the seventh
direction is the center.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
These are the directions that
contain this physical universe.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And this cube is also
called the cube of space

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.140 align:middle line:90%
or the cube of creation.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And this revelation brings us
into the mystery of the cube.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.370 align:middle line:84%
The cube is equally important
in Kabbalah as the tree of life.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We can arrange all of
the letters onto the cube

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
through the axes, the
faces, and the edges.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.230 align:middle line:10%
And working with this
cube is a big piece

00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:10%
of what we do in the
higher forms of Kabbalah

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:10%
in its practical and
mystical applications.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.710 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient shamanic
and mystical traditions

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
also have a process of
calling in the powers

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:90%
from the seven directions.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And something like
this is inherently

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.140 align:middle line:84%
working with the
energy of the cube

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:84%
but in a more shamanic
or elemental way.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:84%
How can we use this knowledge of
the cube within our own lives?

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, the cube can become
an elaborate structure

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.610 align:middle line:90%
that we build within us.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And that great name
of the Tetragrammaton

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:20.630 align:middle line:84%
is used to help seal the
directions energetically.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And it establishes and contains
the space for creation inside.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And everything we
bring into our cube

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is what ultimately
then manifests

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:90%
into our physical life.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Any thoughts or vibrations
that we bring in

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:84%
are manifested into
our physical life.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the cube is
the container for creation.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And understanding the cube
unlocks a greater understanding

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:84%
for how to create and
manifest in our lives.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Another big mystery mentioned
in the "Sepher Yetzirah"

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:58.060 align:middle line:84%
are what's known
as the 231 gates.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:10%
What are they?

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.200 align:middle line:10%
Well, it says that the
22 letters are then

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:10%
arranged around a sphere,
and then each letter

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.320 align:middle line:10%
is combined with all the
other letters in pairs--

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.020 align:middle line:10%
Aleph with Beyt, then with
Gimel, then Dalet, and so on.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And as these 22
letters are paired up

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:84%
in this arrangement
on the sphere,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:84%
it forms what are
called the 231 gates.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And through these gates
all of creation flows.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But it says that the sphere
may rotate either forwards

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.750 align:middle line:90%
or backwards.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
When we rotate it
forwards, it brings good.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we rotate
it backwards, it's

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.700 align:middle line:84%
said to bring evil or
nothing but torment.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very important that we
don't use this from a place

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:47.680 align:middle line:84%
of ego or thinking that we
know when we really don't.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
This isn't something to mess
with or play around with here.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
It's something we
must prepare for--

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
the proper training and direct
handing down to use this.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain keys
described here in the "Sepher

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Yetzirah," but there is
more to be handed down

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:84%
in the oral tradition that
would be needed to work

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.690 align:middle line:90%
with these gates properly.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But through these gates,
it's said that from nothing,

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.110 align:middle line:90%
the source made something.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:84%
From the empty void was
made the material world.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.060 align:middle line:90%
And all life was brought forth.

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
So again, the 231 gates--

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.930 align:middle line:84%
not something to play
around with or try

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:90%
to produce anything with.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.550 align:middle line:84%
But it is a mandala that
we can meditate upon.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we do, the place
that we want to focus on

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is the center point
of this image.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.400 align:middle line:84%
The center point is the place
where everything comes together

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.870 align:middle line:90%
into one.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we meditate upon
that point, it centers us.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.890 align:middle line:84%
It brings us into a place of
silence, stillness, and purity.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to reset our being
into that oneness experience.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Meditating on this image
can be very powerful.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And it awakens us
and helps us become

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
more aware of our
multi-dimensional experience.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.010 align:middle line:10%
Now, you're looking at
the two-dimensional image.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But as you meditate, it takes
on a higher dimensionality.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:20.040 align:middle line:84%
And it coincides with
the movements of a Torus.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
This image correlates with
the top view of that Torus.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
the flow of the Torus

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
from a different perspective
looking now from the side,

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.040 align:middle line:90%
we see that flow.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And meditating on this
image of the 231 gates

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:84%
therefore moves so much
energy within our aura.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, even though this
is all very esoteric,

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and it can often
seem complex, what

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.750 align:middle line:84%
we need to remember about
the "Sepher Yetzirah"

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.270 align:middle line:90%
is that it's all about life.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:84%
It's all about our
experience in the physical

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:84%
and raising our vibration to
progress, learning the lessons

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.220 align:middle line:84%
we're here to
learn that bring us

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.040 align:middle line:84%
toward that attainment
of the Adam Kadmon.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.050 align:middle line:84%
This is about
applying it to life

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:08.710 align:middle line:84%
so that we can harness our
ability to create in our life

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:10.600 align:middle line:90%
and through our cube.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And through this experience,
we can gain greater knowledge,

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.560 align:middle line:90%
understanding, and wisdom.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we do,
we're meant to help

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.280 align:middle line:84%
bring that knowledge
forward and be someone

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.350 align:middle line:84%
who then helps
show others the way

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.690 align:middle line:90%
to having these experiences.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
We're all meant to become
fully realized divine beings.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Whether this happens in our
physical life or the afterlife,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:84%
this is a key piece of training
us to one day attain the state.

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:84%
The "Sepher Yetzirah"
is our code book,

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:84%
bringing us into
practical application

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.240 align:middle line:90%
to support our process.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.540 align:middle line:84%
It gives clues for how
we can harness the four

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
elements, the numbers, letters,
sounds, and sacred geometries,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
to become more
skilled cocreators.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:02.260 align:middle line:84%
To work with this, let's start
with building our foundation

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
before we try jumping into
any advanced techniques.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:84%
If we try to jump without
a proper foundation,

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:84%
we won't be able to sustain
whatever comes from that.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:18.240 align:middle line:10%
To begin, let's meditate
for a moment on the center

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:10%
point of the 231 gates image.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.240 align:middle line:10%
It's good to quiet
the mind before going

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.940 align:middle line:10%
into this experience.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.430 align:middle line:10%
As you meditate on
it with your eyes

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:10%
open, focus from your third
eye to the center point

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.775 align:middle line:10%
of the 231 gates.

00:25:36.775 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:10%


00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.720 align:middle line:10%
Bring your attention
through your body.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And bring it all
into the third eye

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and feel a beam of light
connecting from your third eye

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to that center point
of the mandala.

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:84%
After about a minute or two
of meditating on this image

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.820 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes open,
slowly imagine now

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.580 align:middle line:84%
that it's coming
into your third eye,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:07.620 align:middle line:84%
penetrating into your third
eye, and then close your eyes

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and feel the image being
recreated within your mind.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:90%
Now, focus into your own center.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.380 align:middle line:84%
Bring yourself to
imagine that you

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:84%
are one point within the
center of this image.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, from the
center, we're going

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.080 align:middle line:84%
to establish the cube
and the seven directions.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.640 align:middle line:84%
The way we're going
to do this here

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.310 align:middle line:84%
is by asking ourselves
some questions.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.390 align:middle line:84%
So from the center,
imagine in front of you

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:90%
a wall beginning to form.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the north wall.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And in the north, we ask
ourselves this question.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.610 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
When we ask this
question who am I,

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
we're not asking from a
perspective of personality.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.030 align:middle line:90%
This is an eternal question.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.670 align:middle line:84%
We're asking from
the realm of spirit

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.910 align:middle line:84%
long before we had
a physical life.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And this is true of
all the questions

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.170 align:middle line:90%
that we'll be asking ourselves.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to connect
to our divine essence--

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
the image of the
divine within us.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the I am presence within.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
As we connect to
who am I, it helps

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:29.910 align:middle line:84%
us to re-establish our sense
of strength as a divine being.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:33.690 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
source our power from.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:38.790 align:middle line:84%
This realization of the
I am, such as I am God,

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I am an eternal being,
I am a divine spirit--

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:84%
it helps us to
connect to our power.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Really feel that connection
and see that light.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.360 align:middle line:84%
See that power
flowing in to form

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.880 align:middle line:84%
the north wall in front of you
to form a part of your cube.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:84%
As you ask that
question who am I,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:84%
you might receive an
answer that's spontaneous

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.060 align:middle line:90%
that's coming from your spirit.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.940 align:middle line:84%
When you do, write it down or
speak it out loud or do both.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And once we've connected to
this essence of who we are,

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:84%
now, we bring our attention
to the wall on our right side.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:28.010 align:middle line:90%
And we can call this the east.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And in the east,
we ask ourselves

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.150 align:middle line:90%
the question, what am I?

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.620 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
This question is
different from who

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.270 align:middle line:84%
am I. It's more about
our unique qualities,

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:90%
our attributes and gifts.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the way in which
the divine source

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.180 align:middle line:84%
uniquely expresses itself
through us and our blueprints.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.700 align:middle line:90%
It's our unique way of creating.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.370 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.420 align:middle line:84%
What are my gifts, my unique
qualities, and the way

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:90%
that my power expresses itself?

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Remembering again that this is
coming from our eternal being,

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:12.450 align:middle line:84%
from our spirit, and is
not defined or limited

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:90%
by this physical life.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, when you receive an
answer to the question what

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.900 align:middle line:90%
am I, state it out loud.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Speak it.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Declare it, and then see
the energy solidifying

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to form the right side or
the east wall of your cube,

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.180 align:middle line:90%
and then write it down.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Next, we bring our attention
to the wall behind us

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:90%
or the south wall of the cube.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And here we ask the question
where did I come from?

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.410 align:middle line:84%
This is asking where we come
from on a spiritual level,

00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:54.140 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual ancestry.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:84%
It could also be the lineage
of our physical ancestral line

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and how that
carries into our DNA

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.020 align:middle line:90%
both physical and spiritual.

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Where do I come from?

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, the answers can be
limitless and manyfold.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.090 align:middle line:90%
So receive an answer.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Speak it out loud.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.690 align:middle line:90%
And write it down.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And see that energy
helping to solidify

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:90%
the south wall of your cube.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Then we bring our
attention to the left side,

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:90%
to the west wall of our cube.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.320 align:middle line:90%
The west is about the future.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It's about new beginnings
or the promise of tomorrow.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.930 align:middle line:84%
So in the west, we
ask where am I going?

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we can
ask on an immediate level

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.550 align:middle line:84%
such as where am I going
now, but we can also

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.040 align:middle line:84%
ask it from beyond
this life where

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:84%
am I going in my
spirit's eternal journey?

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Where am I moving
forward from here?

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, the answers
are limitless.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:90%
Work with this.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Receive an answer, and
then speak it out loud

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and write it down.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And see that energy coalescing
to solidify and form

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:12.460 align:middle line:90%
the west wall of your cube.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:90%
Then we look above.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And above is about our
connection to source.

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And we ask what is my
spiritual foundation?

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Who and what do I believe in?

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.700 align:middle line:84%
What is my connection
to that source?

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.390 align:middle line:90%
And how strong is it?

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
This is all a part
of that question what

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.670 align:middle line:90%
is my spiritual foundation?

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And the answers
again are limitless.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And they help form
the ceiling above us.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Then we look below.

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And we ask what is my
physical foundation, meaning

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:90%
what's important in my life?

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.260 align:middle line:84%
What is my physical
life based on?

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could even
ask what do I want

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.350 align:middle line:90%
to bring into my physical life?

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, we
bring our awareness

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.080 align:middle line:90%
into the center of the cube.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:84%
We come back to
ourselves in the center,

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:90%
the center of our being.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And here we ask, what
is my purpose in life?

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.030 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And in the center, in a way,
it's the starting point,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.730 align:middle line:84%
but also everything comes
back to the center in the end.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:84%
We start with the
I am in the center,

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and then we explore around
the walls of the cube.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And from the answers that we
get from the faces and the above

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.370 align:middle line:84%
and below, all of it ultimately
should help tie everything

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:50.370 align:middle line:84%
together into the center to
reveal answers for our purpose.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when we
ask what is my purpose,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:59.190 align:middle line:84%
we want to connect to our divine
essence, our eternal being,

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:84%
and why we chose to
come into this life.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.640 align:middle line:84%
This physical world
is a place where

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.550 align:middle line:84%
we can express our spirit
and our unique gifts.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And we build our cube or
our container for creation

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:18.030 align:middle line:84%
to help manifest it out into
the physical with a purpose.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the foundation--
the core of magic

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:84%
which is defined as changing
nothing into something

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.200 align:middle line:84%
or changing something
into something else,

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.230 align:middle line:84%
moving energy from
Source into us and then

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:32.720 align:middle line:84%
into the physical
more purposefully

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and powerfully with
greater choice and intent.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And as we work with this kind
of approach more and more,

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and we study it more
deeply, and we master it,

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.430 align:middle line:84%
it brings us greater
joy, greater peace,

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:50.340 align:middle line:84%
and a greater flow of
abundance into our lives.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.520 align:middle line:84%
This is how we're
meant to create.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And from the core
essence of our being

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.010 align:middle line:84%
as it expresses
itself into our soul

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and then into the physical
world, the more answers

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.090 align:middle line:84%
we receive over time, the
more they build up our cube.

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And the stronger our cube
becomes, the stronger

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.484 align:middle line:90%
our container for creation.

00:34:09.484 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes the answers
that we get can be limiting.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we receive those
answers from a certain place

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.400 align:middle line:90%
in our evolutionary journey.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were good
and true at the time.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And they might have
served us at that point.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.600 align:middle line:84%
But as we grow and
expand, sometimes those

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.449 align:middle line:90%
answers then begin to limit us.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:84%
It creates a box
that we perceive

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:90%
and define our world from.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:84%
And we need this box to
function in the world.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:42.639 align:middle line:90%
But at some point, it limits us.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.100 align:middle line:90%
So then what do we do?

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we hit those points
where our growth is limited

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and our capacity to flow
abundance becomes limited,

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.670 align:middle line:84%
it's time to dismantle
and reassess everything

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:58.480 align:middle line:84%
from scratch, to empty
our cup, to start fresh

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:84%
with a beginner's mind,
and then build a new cube.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And this time, it's going
to be more expanded and all

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:90%
encompassing.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Still creating
another container that

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.250 align:middle line:84%
allows us to function
in this life, but now,

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.780 align:middle line:90%
it's a bigger container.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.290 align:middle line:90%


00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah is this
ongoing process.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.380 align:middle line:84%
There's never an end point
where we'd stop and say, I know.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.370 align:middle line:84%
There is always a part
that we won't know.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want
to limit ourselves

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:33.060 align:middle line:84%
by just having one belief
system of who and what we are.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So in Kabbalah, we are
constantly evolving,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:84%
expanding our cube, and
sometimes dismantling it,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.810 align:middle line:84%
and building a new one, and
then expanding it again.

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And part of knowing
ourselves is to know

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.290 align:middle line:84%
when we stagnate and let go
of what we think we know.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.115 align:middle line:90%
Empty our cube.

00:35:50.115 --> 00:35:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Let it fall apart.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Only then can we then build a
new and stronger foundation,

00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.690 align:middle line:84%
knowing that we have the
tools to recreate ourselves.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.500 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalists are amazing at
this process of reinventing

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.680 align:middle line:90%
ourselves again and again.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.370 align:middle line:90%
