00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:15.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.460 align:middle line:10%
Have you ever experienced
the hairs on your arm

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:10%
or the back of your
neck standing up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.540 align:middle line:10%
signaling an intuitive hit?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:10%
Or perhaps, your heart
skips a beat or your palms

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:10%
started to sweat?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:90%
What controls this process?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.080 align:middle line:84%
To explore that, let's
take a closer look

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.610 align:middle line:84%
at the parts of our brain said
to be the seat of consciousness

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.140 align:middle line:90%
and intuition.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.050 align:middle line:84%
This area is made of
a few core structures

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that bridge between the limbic
system and the brainstem.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're getting into
the oldest and deepest parts

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of the brain where
activities are mostly

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.460 align:middle line:90%
unconscious and instinctual.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But we can become
conscious of them.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Sensory information that
comes up through the brainstem

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.270 align:middle line:84%
is processed here
and then relayed

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to the higher
parts of the brain.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
By bridging our conscious
awareness into the old brain,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.350 align:middle line:84%
we have the
opportunity to master

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.960 align:middle line:84%
our instinctual and
intuitive responses.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.270 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
When we have greater
awareness of both

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.350 align:middle line:84%
the physical and
spiritual signals coming

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
through our senses,
our perceptions expand.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to perceive becomes
sharper and more accurate.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Not only can we better discern
the stimulus within our body,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.690 align:middle line:84%
but also where that
stimulus is coming from.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But in order to have optimal
functioning of our intuition,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:90%
there's some cleanup to be done.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
With greater
conscious awareness,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.680 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity to deal
with the unconscious reactions

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
that sabotage us.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:84%
We can reprogram the
functions of the old brain

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:84%
so that its reactive
processes work

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.140 align:middle line:90%
with us rather than against us.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a closer
look at the structures

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with here.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
The key structures that bridge
between the limbic system

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and the old brain include
the pituitary gland,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland, and
the hypothalamus gland.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
These three glands sit at the
very top of the brainstem.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And they work together with the
hippocampus and the amygdala

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:84%
to send sensory information
up to the higher cortex.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we have a
physical body sensation,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that feeling comes up from the
body through the brainstem.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We might experience it as an
increase in our heart rate,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
a change in our breath,
a tingling sensation,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
a shift in our body
temperature, or the like.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.760 align:middle line:10%
All of these things are governed
by the old brain's reticular

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:10%
activating system.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.890 align:middle line:10%
And this is a small part
of the brain located just

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:10%
above where the spinal cord
attaches to the brainstem.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
It's the gatekeeper
of information

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
between our body's sensory
systems and the conscious mind.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.810 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, people don't

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
know how to stimulate their
old brain in the proper ways.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
As a result, we're not tapping
into its full capacity.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.010 align:middle line:90%
Why is this?

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Well typically, it's because
people are seeking stimulation

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
from things outside
of themselves.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
There is a network of
structures within this part

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
of the brain that are known
as the reward and pleasure

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.060 align:middle line:90%
centers.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Instead of building
the proper circuitry

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
to access that
pleasure from within,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
we're often looking
for something external

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.780 align:middle line:90%
to get us there.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
When the reward
centers are stimulated,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.020 align:middle line:84%
dopamine and other
neurotransmitters and peptides

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:90%
are released into the body.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.640 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious impulses are
to keep the chemicals flowing.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is what creates
addictive patterns.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.250 align:middle line:10%
Another key structure
that plays in here

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.970 align:middle line:10%
is the amygdala, which
governs our fear response.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
If danger is perceived,
we go into survival mode

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.820 align:middle line:90%
of self-preservation.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Our body responds with increased
heart rate, sweaty palms,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
and other physical
body sensations

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:90%
that signal a potential threat.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
These reactions
happen unconsciously

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:84%
as part of our deep brain
processing and sense

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:90%
of survival.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:10%
We see mainstream
media and politicians

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:10%
target this area quite a bit by
feeding us with drama and fear.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.010 align:middle line:84%
This fear mode puts
our focus on a bad guy.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:90%
And it provokes separation.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.280 align:middle line:84%
These dynamics
lead to imbalances,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.000 align:middle line:84%
making it even easier
for us to be manipulated,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
as we bounced back and
forth between survival mode

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:90%
and pleasure seeking.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the ways we're
programmed by our society,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
creating the subconscious
patterns that drive us.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.920 align:middle line:90%
How do we stop this cycle?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
How do we take back
control of our lives?

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.630 align:middle line:84%
To get out of autopilot and
back into the driver's seat,

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.230 align:middle line:84%
we must reprogram
our old brain system

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:84%
and the signals it is
sending to our limbic system.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:84%
To do that, some of the
most effective methods

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
we have are deep
meditation and deep ritual

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:84%
work where we spend
a prolonged amount

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.900 align:middle line:84%
of time in theta brainwave
states of three to seven Hertz.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Theta waves are generated
by the hippocampus

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:90%
deep within the brain.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
And as we drop into
that deep theta state,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.330 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual
connection is enhanced.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
We become more aware of the
subtle sensations of the body

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and open up to receive
intuitive insights.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
We may experience
profound visions here

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and feel a sense of
connection with the universe.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But typically, it's
just a transition state

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
that we spend only a
short amount of time in.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But when we learn to meditate,
however, and we get good at it,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
we can prolong
our time in theta,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
bringing ourselves into a more
balanced and renewed state.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Our goal when meditating
should be to sustain theta

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.450 align:middle line:90%
as long as we can.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It takes practice to stay in
theta without falling asleep.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And the body may
sleep, but the mind

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.490 align:middle line:84%
remains awake, not the ego
mind, but the part of our mind

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that connects to
the higher realms.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a kind of awareness where
there's no thought involved.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And in this state the
body's rejuvenated

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and our consciousness expands.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Theta brainwaves sweep
up from the hippocampus,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.360 align:middle line:84%
they stimulate the pleasure
centers of the brain,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
and then this releases
molecules that

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.410 align:middle line:84%
bring us into an experience
of gentle euphoria.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
This wave sweeps up from the
deep brain, moves to the higher

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.000 align:middle line:84%
areas, then forward to
the prefrontal cortex,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:90%
and then back and down again.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And a synchronized
theta wave brings us

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.560 align:middle line:90%
into a whole brain state.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It also stimulates
the thalamus gland,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
which regulates our
sleep-wake cycles

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
and directly connects to
the brainstem's reticular

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:90%
activating system.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The thalamus is thought
to play an important role

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:90%
in conscious awareness.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.670 align:middle line:84%
The thalamus also
directly connects

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.320 align:middle line:84%
to the pineal
gland, which is said

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to be the seat of
consciousness within the brain.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland controls
melatonin and serotonin

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.310 align:middle line:84%
production, as well as
our circadian rhythms,

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
which are governed
by light exposure.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's linked to
the day-night cycle.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
exposed to light, it

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:57.900 align:middle line:84%
stimulates that pineal gland
and serotonin production

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.200 align:middle line:84%
kicks in to keep us
active and aware.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And this helps us to be
more focused and alert.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:84%
But when we're in the dark
and the lights are out,

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
that's when melatonin
production kicks in,

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
triggering a sleepy
or restful state.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And in this state, we may
experience inner visions

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:90%
and dreams.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.680 align:middle line:84%
When we are deeply
relaxed, we go

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:84%
into what is called a
trophotropic state, where

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
healing accelerates
within the body.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to achieving
balance or homeostasis,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:84%
there is one other important
gland to mention here.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the pituitary
gland that sits

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.630 align:middle line:84%
behind the bridge of our
nose or the third eye point.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
The pituitary
gland sends signals

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the
endocrine system, which

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:84%
produces the various
hormones of our body.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
So the pituitary gland is
like the main frame control

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
center, determining which
hormones get produced

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and in what amounts, thus
regulating our body's level

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.210 align:middle line:90%
of homeostasis.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, metaphysically,
the endocrine system

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.130 align:middle line:84%
is also directly connected to
our chakras, the major energy

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:90%
centers of our central core.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And it can be thought of as our
body's own inner alchemy lab.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The master glands that
control all the operations

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:84%
of this alchemy are the
pineal and pituitary glands.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Learning how to
properly stimulate them

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
while also keeping
them in balance

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
is crucial to our
overall well-being.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we become aware of
these deep brain functions,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
we can start to adjust
our behaviors in order

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
to bring greater
balance into our system.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Once the system is in
balance, we can then further

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
tap into these centers
of consciousness

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
and expand our ability to
cultivate transcendence states

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.450 align:middle line:90%
from within.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.760 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:10%
In ancient times, initiates in
both the Western and Eastern

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.020 align:middle line:10%
Mystery School traditions
went through a type

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:10%
of sensory deprivation
process to activate

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:10%
these mystical experiences.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, they'd
go into a cave

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
to meditate as an initiatory
process, lasting several days

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.160 align:middle line:84%
or even weeks,
maybe even months,

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160 align:middle line:90%
depending on the tradition.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And this immersion
into the dark is

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.470 align:middle line:84%
something we see in many
traditions around the world.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
What happens during this
process is fascinating.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.950 align:middle line:84%
As they immerse themselves
into the cave with no light,

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
they then willfully work
to suppress their senses

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:90%
of the outer world.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Even the sense of
smell would fade

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:90%
into the background in time.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
They would have very little
auditory input, maybe just

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
the sound of their
own breath, which

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:90%
brings them even more inside.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
The only sensory
inputs remaining

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.090 align:middle line:84%
would be breathing
and gentle movement.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And these are related to the
deepest parts of the brain.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.450 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, this is quieting
the upper regions of the brain,

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.960 align:middle line:84%
while keeping the deepest
parts of the brain awake.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And because they're in the
dark for extended periods,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the serotonin
production would be

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:84%
suppressed while the
melatonin production would

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.070 align:middle line:90%
go into surplus.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The current hypothesis is that
once they got enough rest,

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
the body would realize
that it doesn't

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.200 align:middle line:90%
need all this melatonin.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.760 align:middle line:90%
So what happens?

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, it starts
to polymerize it,

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
combining the molecules
of melatonin together.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And this produces more
complex molecules.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, it comes
into the DMT molecule.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:90%
But we have to be careful here.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.860 align:middle line:84%
There is a big difference
between flooding

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
the brain with a chemical
from an outside source

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
versus building up the inner
pathways to alchemically

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
produce it within
ourselves indigenously.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.650 align:middle line:84%
When we build up the
gateway from within,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.530 align:middle line:90%
that gateway stays open.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.830 align:middle line:10%
We establish the proper
channels and wiring

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:20.380 align:middle line:10%
within the brain to sustain
this access to spiritual vision.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
sustained access

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and true spiritual
mastery, it can

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.210 align:middle line:84%
be counter-productive
to shock our system

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.210 align:middle line:84%
by forcing the experience
from outside chemicals

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:90%
are psychoactive substances.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:39.040 align:middle line:84%
The inner alchemy work is key
to maintaining the balance

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and integrating the experience
in a sustainable way.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Today, we can use breath
work, chants, and techniques

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.200 align:middle line:84%
for knowing where
to place the tongue

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.140 align:middle line:90%
to stimulate this naturally.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.110 align:middle line:84%
By building up the
proper pathways within,

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.925 align:middle line:84%
our whole center of
awareness shifts.

00:12:58.925 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we do the work within,
we can sustain and access it

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:90%
more easily.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:09.340 align:middle line:84%
So how do we bring our
system into balance?

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's return to the
hypothalamus, pituitary,

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:90%
and pineal glands for a moment.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.370 align:middle line:84%
These three glands are known
as the mystical centers

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And they form a
triangular pattern

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.370 align:middle line:90%
within the central core.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Not only do they receive
signals from physical stimuli,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:84%
but they also process
spiritual energy

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:84%
coming down from the
higher vibrational levels.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Together, these three glands
regulate our homeostasis.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is key.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Homeostasis is the
state that we want

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.885 align:middle line:84%
to be in to access our
sense of inner peace.

00:13:48.885 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a state where
everything is good

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.660 align:middle line:84%
and where we know within
every cell of our being

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.380 align:middle line:84%
that we are perfect
and we are divine.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.640 align:middle line:84%
That's the homeostasis
we are meant to be in.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But if we're flooding the
body with chemicals trying

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.620 align:middle line:84%
to force or shortcut
the experience,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.460 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to
reach that homeostasis.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Flooding our system takes
us into an extreme state

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.340 align:middle line:90%
away from homeostasis.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, practices
like meditation, qigong,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.990 align:middle line:84%
breath work, sacred
chants, and ritual

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
are all methods that can
more holistically move us

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.180 align:middle line:90%
towards our homeostasis.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.880 align:middle line:84%
They help us to
gradually build up

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.490 align:middle line:84%
those proper pathways
within our body

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.210 align:middle line:84%
and rewire our brain for more
optimal and interconnected

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:90%
functioning.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.700 align:middle line:84%
What does it take to rewire
and gain greater self

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:90%
mastery of our old brain?

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, it
takes self-awareness.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
Most people aren't aware of
the stimuli being processed

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:90%
through the old brain.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:90%
It happens unconsciously.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it affects the
choices we make.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Without realizing it,
we make snap judgments.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.550 align:middle line:84%
This happens through a
process the scientists call

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:90%
thin slicing.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:11.300 align:middle line:84%
There can be a certain
level of accuracy with this.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:10%
For example, in Malcolm
Gladwell's book "Blink,"

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:10%
he reports how in
just a few seconds

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:10%
we can thin slice situations
with about 80% accuracy.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
What we need to watch out
for our personal filters

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:90%
and biases.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
When we properly train
ourselves to be more self-aware,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
we can better understand
where those judgments

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:90%
are coming from.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:84%
We can also become
more conscious

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:90%
of the body's signals.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Much of this has to do
with paying attention

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.220 align:middle line:90%
to the subtle details.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.820 align:middle line:84%
The more we condition
ourselves to notice the details

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention,
the more this level

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
of awareness becomes
innate and automatic.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:90%
This self work is important.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.580 align:middle line:84%
We have to clear
these old patterns

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.530 align:middle line:84%
so that they don't
distort or block us

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
from recognizing
what's really going on.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Our accuracy of
perception drastically

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.820 align:middle line:84%
improves when we are not only
aware of the signal itself,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:90%
but also where it's coming from.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
What do I mean by where
a signal's coming from?

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, for example, we
can ask, is this stimulus

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.160 align:middle line:90%
coming from inside of me?

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Or does it originate
outside in the environment?

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
If it's from outside,
what's the source of it?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
If it's from
inside, Is it coming

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:84%
from my ego, or my subconscious,
or my mind, or my soul?

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:44.890 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that I'm meant
to be paying attention to?

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
When we can identify
where it's coming from,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.070 align:middle line:84%
we become much more clear and
less susceptible to distortion

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.320 align:middle line:90%
from bias.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:10%
So there's a two-prong
approach to this path.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.030 align:middle line:84%
First is to do the healing
work needed to clear away

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:90%
our distortions and biases.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Second is to rewire ourselves
to sustain conscious awareness

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and choice in how we respond
to our deep body brain signals.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
What do you suppose is
the key to increasing

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:84%
our level of awareness
and maintaining it?

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Typically, when people
are asked this question,

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:84%
they come up with a
wide variety of answers,

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:84%
even though the answer
becomes obvious to us

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:90%
once it's revealed.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
The key rests in a
certain kind of attitude.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And this attitude affects
so much in our lives.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:84%
It determines whether we
are living in mediocrity

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.830 align:middle line:84%
or whether we are
truly thriving in life

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and achieving our
greater potential.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.240 align:middle line:90%
So here's the secret formula.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Awareness equals caring.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:84%
When we care about
someone or something,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.140 align:middle line:90%
we pay more attention to it.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:84%
When we care, the
details matter.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
When we care, we
make more effort.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
When we care, we
take the actions

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:90%
needed to make a difference.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.500 align:middle line:84%
When we care, our
hearts open up.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And when our hearts are
open, we are more in tune

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:84%
with our body as
well as our spirit.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
Yes, my friends,
awareness is caring.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.400 align:middle line:84%
So if I could offer one
piece of advice here,

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:84%
it would be to eliminate
the phrase "I don't care"

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:90%
from your vocabulary.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to say something
like, "I'm not attached."

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to
rise above mediocrity

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.130 align:middle line:84%
and start to thrive in life,
then reframe your attitude

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.670 align:middle line:90%
from not caring to I care.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.270 align:middle line:84%
The world will become a much
better place when we all

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
start to care more again.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Once we start shifting
into caring more,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:84%
how do we then rewire
ourselves to sustain

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:90%
our new level of awareness?

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.440 align:middle line:84%
This step requires building
bridges between the old brain

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and the higher
regions of the brain.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:84%
We must repair and
rewire those areas

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.130 align:middle line:84%
where we've stored negative
patterns or trauma.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:22.310 align:middle line:84%
When we do this work,
our thin slicing

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:90%
becomes much more accurate.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.480 align:middle line:84%
We can work our way towards
90% to 99% accuracy.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.120 align:middle line:84%
We'll always have our
judgments and our flaws,

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.890 align:middle line:84%
so long as we're in
this physical body.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:84%
But we definitely
have the ability

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to get to 95%
accuracy or better.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is that
we have the ability

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.660 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate this
experience within.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.520 align:middle line:84%
When we do this
from within, we are

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.190 align:middle line:90%
in control of the experience.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes something
we can sustain.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
When we do the work to open
those gates, we find the way

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and can then always open
it from within ourselves

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:90%
whenever we need to.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.990 align:middle line:90%
We realize that we are the key.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.590 align:middle line:90%
We are the gate.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And in the Mystery
Schools, we've

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:84%
always taught that the
full powers of heaven

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:90%
and the universe are within us.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we are this eternal
being with access to the quantum

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:84%
field, and yet we choose
to give our power away

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:84%
to something outside of us, then
we're diminishing ourselves.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
For us to have self mastery, we
can't be giving our power away.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Various spiritual traditions
may hand down tools and methods.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to each
of us to pick those

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.810 align:middle line:90%
up and work with them.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And it takes discipline to
achieve our full potential.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
It takes devotion to
fulfill our purpose.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.860 align:middle line:90%
How do we pursue self mastery?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Here, we come to what I
call the doing bridge.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the key to
rewiring the old brain.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.060 align:middle line:84%
It's all about what we do,
meaning our daily actions.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:15.640 align:middle line:84%
The doing bridge is built on
ritualized behavior and habits.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It's our way of being.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And it comes through
integrating skills

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.760 align:middle line:84%
until they become second nature,
like learning to ride a bike.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.820 align:middle line:10%
It takes time and practice
to learn those motor skills

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.110 align:middle line:10%
and balance.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.080 align:middle line:90%
But once you know, you know.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.130 align:middle line:84%
This is how we program the
old brain, through repetition,

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
until a pattern become
so integrated that it's

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.765 align:middle line:90%
second nature.

00:21:41.765 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We get to the point
where we don't even

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:90%
think about it anymore.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.880 align:middle line:84%
As we take these
skills and master them,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.370 align:middle line:84%
it frees up higher centers of
the brain to learn new skills.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:84%
The integrated learning
then becomes automatic.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
This is how we build
our base for life.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.060 align:middle line:84%
We're building our
foundation here.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And we construct it through
how we live and operate

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.870 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the mystical
tradition of kabbalah,

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
the sphere on the tree
of life called yesod,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.790 align:middle line:84%
is associated with
this foundation.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Its core essence is
captured in the affirmation.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%
In thought, in word, in deed,
I rest my life from day to day

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:84%
upon the sure foundation
of eternal being.

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:84%
This tells us that what
we do, how we think,

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and the words we use on
a regular daily basis

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
reveals our
subconscious patterning.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
This foundation
relates to the wiring

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:84%
of our old brain, which filters
what stimuli we perceive.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious
patterning determines

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.280 align:middle line:84%
what we become aware
of and how we react.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:84%
In the universe of kabbalah,
we reprogram the mind,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
bringing light into
the subconscious

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have
more full awareness.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, what we want
is to have our base for life

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:84%
resting upon our
eternal being, to live

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.390 align:middle line:90%
as our full, divine self.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.880 align:middle line:84%
That is what creates
the strongest

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.920 align:middle line:90%
foundation for our life.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Yet, to get there, we
must unwind and peel away

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the layers of faulty
programming, beliefs,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.380 align:middle line:90%
and attachments.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.560 align:middle line:84%
How do we reprogram
our foundation?

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.010 align:middle line:84%
It's done through
consistency and repetition.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.200 align:middle line:90%
It takes time and discipline.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.940 align:middle line:90%
But it's worth it.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.370 align:middle line:84%
When we have a
strong foundation,

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:84%
we're more supported to fulfill
our potential and purpose.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're less likely
to sabotage ourselves

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:90%
in the process.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:10%
Self-sabotage kicks
in when there's

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.290 align:middle line:10%
dysfunction in our foundation.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Is our foundation strong
enough to hold us in balance,

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.350 align:middle line:84%
especially when we
hit our stress points

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:90%
or when fear comes up?

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:84%
If we want to understand
where and why things go wrong,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:90%
we need to look here.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
This is at the core of how we
operate as physical beings.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.840 align:middle line:84%
You may know someone
who seems spiritual.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're really into
the philosophical ideas.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
seem to embody it.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality remains
just a concept

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:40.010 align:middle line:84%
until we do the work
to heal at a core level

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:90%
and repattern our life.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.090 align:middle line:84%
A big part of the work
is building a more sure

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.190 align:middle line:90%
foundation.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
It's about living
it and doing it.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.830 align:middle line:90%
It's how we live life every day.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.600 align:middle line:84%
The kingdom of spirit can become
embodied in our physical life

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.030 align:middle line:90%
in its full capacity.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And how we achieve
that is by mastering

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.880 align:middle line:84%
all aspects of our
physical experience

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.040 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
trying to escape it.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get
started with this?

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
We can start by making
a list of our habits,

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.230 align:middle line:84%
brainstorm everything
you do on a daily basis,

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
identify your routine,
not only in your actions,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:84%
but also your thoughts
and your words.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Then the next step is to look
at this list and identify

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
the habits that support you
and the ones that don't.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:41.270 align:middle line:84%
To get clear on what habits
are supportive or not, take

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:84%
some time to think
about your goals,

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.820 align:middle line:84%
the things you'd like
to accomplish in life,

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.840 align:middle line:84%
or how you'd like your
daily experience to be.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.240 align:middle line:84%
Think about how you
want to experience life.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.490 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Then take a look at the
patterns you've identified

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.370 align:middle line:90%
that serve these goals.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.390 align:middle line:10%
And if you find a pattern
or habit that doesn't serve,

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.990 align:middle line:10%
it's important to replace
it with something new.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Find something more
supportive and add

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that in to reprogram
your routine.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Once you've identified the
changes you'd like to make,

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.250 align:middle line:84%
the next step is to
really commit to yourself.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Nothing will change if we
don't take the steps to do it.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.120 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to redirect
ourselves and create

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.400 align:middle line:90%
a new pattern.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But the good news is that
it gets easier with time.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:84%
Research shows that,
on average, it's

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.730 align:middle line:84%
about a two month period of
really putting in the effort

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:45.020 align:middle line:84%
to do it daily before
a new habit is formed.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Consistency is the key
to reprogramming our life

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.260 align:middle line:84%
If we commit to new routine
and practice it maybe

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.280 align:middle line:84%
at the same time every day
or in the same context,

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:84%
we'll have much higher
chance of success.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's OK if we miss one
day, so long as we pick it

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.430 align:middle line:84%
up again the next day and
the next several days.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The other key to
new habit formation

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is to be specific in
the goal, as well as

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:21.620 align:middle line:84%
devise a plan of exactly when
and where you will do it.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Over 90% of the
people who succeed

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:84%
at implementing a new
routine are the ones who

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
create a specific plan
and follow through

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.750 align:middle line:84%
on their intention,
meaning enter it

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
into your schedule, the actual
days, times, and locations

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.440 align:middle line:84%
that you will commit to
doing that new behavior.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:10%
For example, I commit to
meditating twice a day

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:51.410 align:middle line:10%
for 45 minutes starting at
5:00 AM at home and 1:00 PM

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:55.010 align:middle line:10%
after lunch at work everyday.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we're talking
about a spiritual practice,

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.740 align:middle line:84%
is it the same as creating
new physical habits?

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.860 align:middle line:90%
We can use similar principles.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:90%
But it goes beyond that.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.350 align:middle line:84%
That's because we're
bringing in spiritual energy.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And at certain points in
our spiritual practice,

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.990 align:middle line:84%
we start to trigger
those pleasure centers

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.905 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And this pleasure and
sharing your experience

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.180 align:middle line:84%
increases our
desire to continue.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
But we still have to be
consistent to maintain.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
To work with this, do a 60 day
challenge to really implement

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:90%
new changes into your life.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Or if working with
it twice a day,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:84%
you can reduce it to
maybe a 40 day challenge.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Once your goal and
plan are set, including

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.590 align:middle line:84%
when and where, it's then
up to you to follow through.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we are
habitual beings.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Once the new pattern
is established,

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.880 align:middle line:90%
it's easier to maintain it.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Those first 40 to 60
days are the hardest.

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.460 align:middle line:90%
But after that, it gets easier.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.910 align:middle line:84%
To help with the
initial push, find

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:84%
a rhythm that works for you
and establish your plan.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.350 align:middle line:84%
If you do it at the same
time or in the same sequence

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.910 align:middle line:84%
or context, this also
supports our success.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Committing to a new daily habit
builds new neural circuitry

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.090 align:middle line:90%
within the brain.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But what about deconstructing
the old habits that

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:90%
aren't serving us?

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything we can
do to aid the breakdown

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.130 align:middle line:90%
of this old neural wiring?

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.760 align:middle line:84%
This brings us back to our
theta meditation practice.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:45.650 align:middle line:84%
The most effective method for
pruning unused neural patterns

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:84%
is through prolonged
meditation in a theta state.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:84%
When we access theta, we
go into a healing state,

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:58.350 align:middle line:84%
balancing the parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
for this process

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:05.090 align:middle line:84%
to happen if we want to
rewire the old brain.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Often, our brain activity is
dominated by the upper regions

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:09.630 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.780 align:middle line:84%
But when we sustain
a theta state,

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:17.130 align:middle line:84%
it gives the deep brain
a chance to rewire.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Let's put this into
a practical exercise.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.840 align:middle line:84%
To start, we've
already established

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:84%
a new daily practice and
committed to at least a 40

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.060 align:middle line:90%
to 60 day challenge.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can bring in
breathing techniques

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:84%
to support our effort,
to rewire and reprogram

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:90%
these new daily actions.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We have everything
we need inside of us

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.640 align:middle line:84%
to bring ourselves
into a theta state.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't really need binaural
beats or entrainment tools,

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:90%
although they can be helpful.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's really a simple process
of deep, rhythmic breathing.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Start by breathing in
deeply through the nose

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:05.610 align:middle line:84%
and pull the breath down to
the hara, just below the navel.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Then breathe out with a
strong, audible breath.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.713 align:middle line:84%
Repeat this several times,
breathing in through the nose,

00:31:14.713 --> 00:31:15.630 align:middle line:90%
out through the mouth.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.420 align:middle line:90%


00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.960 align:middle line:84%
This breathing technique
calms the nervous system

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:90%
and helps to reduce stress.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.150 align:middle line:84%
As you maintain this
rhythmic breathing,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:34.230 align:middle line:84%
eventually you'll sink
deeper into a theta state.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.530 align:middle line:84%
As you go deeper,
let go of thought.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Let go of attachment.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Let it pass by your mind.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to be
carried deeper and deeper

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:52.200 align:middle line:84%
into meditation, as you
focus only on your breath.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, you'll
enter the theta state.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.490 align:middle line:84%
You may experience inner
visions, like colors, symbols,

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.030 align:middle line:90%
or sacred geometries.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And if these images
start appearing,

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:84%
just witness them
like a daydream,

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.835 align:middle line:84%
yet still keeping your
focus on the breath.

00:32:09.835 --> 00:32:21.240 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Make this a daily practice to
cultivate the theta brainwave

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.820 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Notice what happens when
you come into theta.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.000 align:middle line:84%
You may start getting
into that zone

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.670 align:middle line:84%
where we begin to access
more spiritual energy

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and a state of transcendence.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:44.116 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to sustain
this as long as possible.

00:32:44.116 --> 00:32:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may take
15 to 20 minutes

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to start to relax enough
just to get into theta.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And once we move into
that theta state,

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:84%
we then want to maintain
it for as long as we can

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.950 align:middle line:84%
without falling asleep
or popping back out.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.590 align:middle line:84%
The more we practice
this, the longer

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.940 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to hold
it for ourselves.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And this opens the
pituitary and pineal glands.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.860 align:middle line:90%
The third eye opens.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And we start having
more spiritual visions

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.700 align:middle line:90%
with our practice.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.430 align:middle line:84%
We're rewiring the brain
through this process

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to be more aware of
spiritual energies.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.670 align:middle line:84%
Ancient hermetic
teachings-- again, they

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:29.910 align:middle line:84%
tell us to withdraw into
yourself and it shall come.

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Will it and it is so.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Make idle the senses of the body
and the Spirit will be born.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we venture
further on our journey

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to rewiring our
brain and body system

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:49.340 align:middle line:84%
and exploring the
mind-heart connection

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.940 align:middle line:84%
of our human potential with
me in this episode of "Mystery

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Teachings."

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:02.944 align:middle line:90%
