00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.770 align:middle line:84%
Why is it so important
for us to understand

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.530 align:middle line:90%
masculine and feminine energies?

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing,
understanding them will help us

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:84%
have better relationships
with others in our lives.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Even more than
that, it will help

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.310 align:middle line:84%
us have a better
understanding of ourselves

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:90%
and how we flow energy.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:84%
When we can truly harmonize
these polar energies

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves and
our relationships,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.510 align:middle line:84%
it sets us on the
road to harnessing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:90%
more of our full potential.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
take a deeper dive

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:84%
into the archetypes
of the magician

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:90%
and the high priestess.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Together, they awaken the
divine masculine and feminine

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:90%
archetypes within us.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
They are the primordial
yang and yin.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
The yang being more
active and outgoing,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:84%
while the yin is more
receptive and internal.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.640 align:middle line:10%
So in a sense,
these two archetypes

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:10%
are like the fool's
celestial parents.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:10%
They help us to connect with
the primal forces of creation

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:10%
in the cosmos,
which are expansion

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:10%
and contraction, outward flow
balanced with inward flow.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And the magician
helps us to learn

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
how to draw spirit
energy down for creation

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.800 align:middle line:84%
into the external world, while
the high priestess helps us

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:84%
on a subtle plane level
to connect inwardly

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.220 align:middle line:84%
with spirit in order to
evolve our subtle body

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:90%
and our consciousness.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
I recall the mandala
wheel of the 231 gates

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
with the Tarot keys
placed around it.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:84%
The key zero, or the
fool, is placed at the top

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
of the wheel with olive.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And as the wheel now rotates
clockwise to keys one and two,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
we begin the descent down
the left side of the wheel.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
This descent is
about learning how

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:90%
to master the physical plane.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
The first seven keys also
relate to various stages

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:84%
of preparation for
the great work.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:10%
And these form the early
lessons of this journey

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:10%
that teach us about the
archetypal principles.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:10%


00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:10%
As we take our next step
on the hero's journey,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:10%
we meet the magician.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.460 align:middle line:10%
So why does a
magician come next?

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.320 align:middle line:10%
Well, this represents
the first step

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.830 align:middle line:10%
of that limitless life that's
depicted as the fool, which

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:10%
now takes its step into
the journey towards self

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:10%
actualization.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:10%
That's why as an
archetype the magician

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.140 align:middle line:10%
represents the wizards, the
magi, and the wise men who

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:10%
have the power to
make things happen

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.340 align:middle line:10%
and to create by their will.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Most people today don't seem
to understand the proper use

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:90%
of this word magic.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And that's largely because it's
been given a bad reputation

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.580 align:middle line:90%
from both science and religion.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.120 align:middle line:90%
So let's clarify this term here.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.420 align:middle line:84%
What does the original use of
the word magic really mean?

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, we
spell magick with a K

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.320 align:middle line:84%
to indicate that we're
talking about real magic here

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.680 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to trickery
or stage magic.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
The K stands for
having the right keys

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.980 align:middle line:90%
to perform real magick.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.180 align:middle line:10%
And some of these keys
are depicted in the Tarot

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.130 align:middle line:10%
card of the magician.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:10%
So here's a definition
to write down.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Magick means to change nothing
into something or something

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:90%
into something else.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.915 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's the process
of creation and transformation.

00:03:39.915 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the rules
for the magician

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:84%
states that the
magician must bring

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
about a successful
combination of intense desire

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and concentration with
an appropriate object.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
He masters this art and science
of focusing his mind and will

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
towards the accomplishment
of his desires.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I did just say science.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Egypt, the
word magic meant the same

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
as what we mean
by science today.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, the
magicians were the priests.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.170 align:middle line:84%
They were the ones
with the knowledge,

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.235 align:middle line:84%
and they preserved and taught
this knowledge to others.

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:17.110 align:middle line:10%
A great example
of this archetype

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:10%
is Hermes Trismegistus,
the sage priest magician

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.490 align:middle line:10%
whose legacy and teachings have
lasted for thousands of years

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:10%
through the Western
Mystery School tradition.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
This path is about the quest
to understand and manifest

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.925 align:middle line:90%
hidden wisdom.

00:04:32.925 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's a path
that has produced

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.210 align:middle line:84%
many mystical
philosophers like Socrates

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and Plato and Pythagoras,
just to name a few.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
numerology for a moment.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, the fool was number zero,
which makes the magician number

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:90%
one.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.050 align:middle line:84%
So number one is the
beginning of a cycle.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It's where creation begins,
and it's quite dynamic.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:84%
It represents the initiation
of all creative processes.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.870 align:middle line:84%
It's the seed or divine
spark of creation,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:90%
where all new ideas come from.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
This number one is full
of authority, power,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and leadership.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, as we look at the imagery
of the card of the magician,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.970 align:middle line:10%
we see that this
key also depicts

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.880 align:middle line:10%
this essence of concentration.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:10%
Notice his posture.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:10%
His right hand is upholding
a double-terminated wand,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.490 align:middle line:10%
while his left hand
is pointing down.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:10%
And with this right hand, he's
actively calling in the energy

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.670 align:middle line:10%
from above through the wand
to be directed into creation.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:10%
That cosmic force then
passes through him

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:10%
and through his
heart, in particular,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:10%
and then is directed into the
realms below to be manifested.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:10%
His left hand acts as
a transparent channel

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.980 align:middle line:10%
for that power.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
The magician recognizes
that he's just a conduit.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.770 align:middle line:84%
He's receptive to the
powers from above.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.000 align:middle line:90%
He's actively calling them in.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
And then he's concentrating
them towards the object

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.150 align:middle line:90%
of his focus.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
This act of
concentration is shown

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:84%
by his finger pointing
directly at what

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:90%
he wants to focus it towards.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It's precisely directed towards
what he wants to create.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, he
must remain transparent

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.500 align:middle line:84%
so that the full amount
of light and power

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:28.210 align:middle line:84%
can flow through him, meaning
he has to have this ability

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to have mastered himself enough
to not block that flow of light

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:90%
in any way.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:10%
He thus works in harmony
with the universe

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.120 align:middle line:10%
using this "as above,
so below" principle.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.770 align:middle line:10%
Another way that
this is indicated

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.280 align:middle line:10%
is with the sideways figure
eight that's over his head.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
We call this the lemniscate,
or the infinity sign.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And it symbolizes
a balance point

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.920 align:middle line:90%
that harmonizes the opposites.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
The active masculine and the
receptive feminine principles

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%
must work together.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:10%
This is true for all creative
work, even the creation

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.290 align:middle line:10%
of the cosmos.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, the primary color
around the magician

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.680 align:middle line:10%
is also bright yellow,
very similar to the fool.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:10%
And it again, represents
the element of air,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.794 align:middle line:10%
as well as that radiant
light of the spirit.

00:07:16.794 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the Universal
Waite Tarot deck,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:10%
he is also surrounded by
this aura of white light,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.290 align:middle line:10%
indicating that his power
comes from a divine source.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:10%
The magician wears two robes.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:10%
His white robe is
the inner robe,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:10%
and it represents purity,
truth, and wisdom of the spirit,

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:10%
while his outer
robe is red, and it

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.730 align:middle line:10%
represents passion and desire
and active use of will.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Notice also that he
has a belt around him.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And this belt is a serpent that
bites its own tail, also known

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.510 align:middle line:90%
as the ouroboros.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:10%
And this is symbolic of that
eternal cycle of transformation

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.695 align:middle line:10%
and the tradition of alchemy.

00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:84%
The magician, as he's doing
his work, is in a garden.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
This garden offers him a
private and sacred space

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.235 align:middle line:90%
in which to perform his magic.

00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, the garden is something
that we must cultivate.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.820 align:middle line:84%
It's the ground of our
being that we must purposely

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:90%
till and fertilize.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.420 align:middle line:84%
We have to pull the
weeds out of it,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.010 align:middle line:84%
and we have to plant
the seeds within it.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's something we must
consciously and actively tend

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.690 align:middle line:84%
to in order for it to
thrive and be beautiful.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:10%
This garden represents our life.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.789 align:middle line:10%
And the soil in which it grows
is our subconscious mind.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:43.230 align:middle line:10%
The flowers of this garden are
red roses and white lilies.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:84%
The red roses represent
desire, the desire

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
to create what we want and to
live a fulfilled life that's

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:90%
aligned with our highest good.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:84%
The roses represent
the kinds of things

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that we want to experience
with our five senses.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But the white lilies
represent knowledge.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
This is more of an
abstract kind of knowledge.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.020 align:middle line:84%
It's about grasping hidden
truths and the higher

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:84%
principles or laws
of the universe.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.890 align:middle line:10%
So desire and the
quest for knowledge

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:10%
are the two things that drive
the magician in his work.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:10%
Oh, in front of the magician
we see a table or an altar.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:10%
And this represents the
field of his attention.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.120 align:middle line:84%
The altar also has sacred
tools and symbols upon it

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.520 align:middle line:84%
that represent what he
wants that energy to be

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.380 align:middle line:90%
flowing through into the world.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately he wants
everything in this energy

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
to be manifested in the
three-dimensional world

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:90%
of physicality.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And so he has to have all
four elements on the altar.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:10%
So we see these symbols
are magical tools that

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.980 align:middle line:10%
represent the four elements.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.490 align:middle line:10%
The elements of Earth is
represented by the pentacle,

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:10%
or the five-pointed star.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:10%
And this symbolizes
our ability to wield

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.455 align:middle line:10%
all the powers of nature
and direct them into form.

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:04.320 align:middle line:10%
It represents the success
of the fifth element,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.990 align:middle line:10%
or the spirit
embodied in the flesh.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:10%
The water element is represented
by the chalice or the grail

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.080 align:middle line:10%
on the altar.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:10%
This is our ability to
receive inspiration,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:10%
to connect with intuition, and
to use our active imagination.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
This allows us to reach beyond
the ordinary three-dimensional

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:84%
way of operating and into
the spiritual realms.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:10%
The air element is represented
by the sword, which

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.990 align:middle line:10%
is our ability to
access a higher mind

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.010 align:middle line:10%
and to act with discernment,
while the fire element is

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.220 align:middle line:10%
represented by the wood
staff, representing

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.885 align:middle line:10%
our ability to harness and
steer our will and our desires.

00:10:45.885 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a whole, this key is
an image of the great work.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.010 align:middle line:90%
What is the great work?

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
There's an old motto of the
initiates that refers to it.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:90%
And this is how it goes.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:10%
It says "to will, to know, to
dare, and to keep the silence."

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.920 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's break each
of these parts down.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.110 align:middle line:84%
"To will" is to exercise
our personal will,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
which implies choice
and discernment.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge here is
to follow our inner calling,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
even if it goes against common
opinions and what's acceptable.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.010 align:middle line:84%
We need to stay
engaged and motivated,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
even when others might
nay stay or not support

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.140 align:middle line:90%
what it is we're trying to do.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
The second part of
this motto, "to dare,"

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
refers to times when
certain subjects

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual practices
are restricted.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And various powers that be,
whether political, religious,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.670 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot, don't
want us to do them.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And it takes daring
and courage to stand

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:90%
against those cultural norms.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.570 align:middle line:84%
It calls for bravery
and nonconformity

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:90%
and independent thinking.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
The third part, 'to
know," is to always

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
have a thirst for knowledge
and understanding and learning.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.320 align:middle line:84%
It refers to the
old saying that was

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
above the doors of all the
ancient mystery schools, which

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:90%
said, know thyself.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.490 align:middle line:84%
The fourth part of this
motto, "to keep the silence,"

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:84%
relates to not talking to
others about your creative work

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:90%
or magical operations.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is in an effort to
keep it sacred and protected.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Plus, when you're
creating something

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:84%
and you talk about
it before it's done,

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
other people's opinions
might interfere or distort

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
what you're trying
to accomplish.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
What is this magician key
really trying to teach us?

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:84%
This path shows us that
we have all that we

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.660 align:middle line:90%
need to achieve success.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:84%
But we must learn to use all of
our spiritual tools to do so.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The magician shows us
how to contact and direct

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.560 align:middle line:90%
that source energy.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But it takes discipline
to remain attentive

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:90%
to that higher power.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And this self
mastery can only be

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
borne through actively engaging
in deep personal practice

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:90%
and the use of the tools.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, the magician
stands in exact contrast

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:10%
to the unbridled fool.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:10%
He represents concentration,
will, technique,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.570 align:middle line:10%
and all the skills that
are necessary for achieving

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:10%
success.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:10%
And this skill is to be found in
the divine masculine archetype

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:10%
which the magician represents.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.400 align:middle line:10%
He's like the celestial
father energy.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, his secret title or secret
name is "The Magus of Power."

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:10%
And the elements
that he works with

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.895 align:middle line:10%
is a combination
of air and water.

00:13:37.895 --> 00:13:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's because the
planet and the metal

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that he corresponds
to is Mercury.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Mercury is the closest
planet to the sun.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And it has the fastest
orbit in our solar system.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:10%
And the Roman god
Mercury, to whom

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:10%
this planet was named after,
was the messenger of the gods.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:10%
He transmits wisdom to humans.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
Mercury's often depicted
with winged feet and helmet.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And he's quick and
witty and communicative.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
He's a fast learner,
and he likes

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
to teach what he
knows to others.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.250 align:middle line:84%
He brought many
inventions to humanity

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and is the most important
deity to the alchemists.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:18.250 align:middle line:84%
He's also associated
with Thoth Hermes

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient
Egyptian and Greek myths.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.590 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
attributed the source

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:84%
of all their science and
wisdom to Thoth Hermes/Mercury,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:33.410 align:middle line:84%
including the science of
astronomy, astrology, math,

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
geometry, medicine, language,
logic, rhetoric, music,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:90%
alchemy, magic, and so on.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:10%
He was the great
magician or transformer.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
He's often depicted
as holding a conducive

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:84%
staff, which is a symbol of
the alchemical and the healing

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:90%
arts.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.150 align:middle line:10%
And the magical gifts
that Mercury might give us

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.490 align:middle line:10%
include the
caduceus, or it might

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:10%
include the Ibis bird, which
is related to the god Thoth,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.670 align:middle line:10%
or the all-seeing eye,
which relates to wisdom.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Because mercury represents
communication, intellect,

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and reason, his influence
can sometimes make us

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:14.780 align:middle line:90%
a bit analytical at times.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
watch out for that.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, Mercury rules
Gemini and Virgo, as well as

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
the third house of
communication and intellect.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And it also rules the
sixth house of health.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a number of other
key words or qualities that are

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:90%
associated with the magician.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
These include everything from
expression to communication,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
having good timing, being
flexible, conscious use

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
of our power, confidence
in the skills that we have,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:90%
creative abilities.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, the strengths
are the balanced

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:84%
or the pure expression
of the archetype.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But when that archetype gets
into imbalances or distortions

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.740 align:middle line:84%
as it expresses
itself through us,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
it can come into a weakness
or a shadow aspect.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
That happens when it's
either too much or too little

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.380 align:middle line:84%
of that quality
coming into our life.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So examples of some
of the weaknesses

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:84%
and the vises of
the magician could

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.630 align:middle line:84%
be being untruthful
or thoughtless,

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:23.430 align:middle line:84%
being pessimistic, being
scattered or indirect.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And in his darker
forms, the magician

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.650 align:middle line:84%
might engage in
trickery and deceit,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:84%
even the use of black magic for
personal or destructive intent.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.160 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the
shadow and as we

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
work to bring it
to light within us,

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:84%
the magician can
help us to recognize

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that there's more
to any situation

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.950 align:middle line:90%
than what meets the eye.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And he gives us the power to
create order out of chaos.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
He also helps us to recognize
and to see our own potential

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
and be able to
visualize the work that

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.340 align:middle line:90%
is required to manifest it.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of the benefits
that we gain

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
when we work with
the magician include

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
helping us to be able
to prioritize and make

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:90%
wise choices in our life.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
He encourages us to
take action rather

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:84%
than simply wishing
for change or success

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.859 align:middle line:90%
to just happen for us.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We can also work
with the magician

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.780 align:middle line:84%
when we want to focus
our energy effectively

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.740 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish our goals.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
But what are some ways
the magician might show up

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.890 align:middle line:90%
in our lives today?

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.619 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of the times when
you've either been the magician

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:84%
or you've encountered the
magician in somebody else.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, recall
a time when you were

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.300 align:middle line:90%
inspired to create something.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Remember how you had to go
from a mere idea or inspiration

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to then creating a more clear
vision of it in your mind,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.550 align:middle line:84%
perhaps then having to
communicate it with others,

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and then devise a plan
to bring it into reality,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and finally to harness your
talents and take action

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:90%
to make it happen.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.850 align:middle line:84%
It's in creative
times like this,

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.130 align:middle line:84%
the magician was most
active in your life.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But what might our parallel life
look like under the archetype

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:90%
of the magician?

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, in ages past,
we might have actually

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:90%
been a wizard or a shaman.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.700 align:middle line:84%
But if we're looking for
more contemporary examples,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:84%
think of a successful
entrepreneur

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:19.360 align:middle line:84%
who has a high degree of
skill and communications.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Other examples of a magician
in some kind of profession

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.250 align:middle line:84%
might include teaching,
counseling, consulting,

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
management, various
aspects of media.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And whatever the field, if
they're truly a magician, then

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:84%
they will master their
trade and create success.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:84%
By working with the magician
and invoking its energies

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:46.315 align:middle line:84%
into our life, we, too, can
awaken our magic and mastery.

00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But before we move into the
practical and experiential

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
aspects, let's
work with one more

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.980 align:middle line:84%
archetype and weave
these two together.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Our second step on
the hero's journey

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.960 align:middle line:90%
brings us to the high priestess.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.200 align:middle line:10%
The high priestess represents
the divine feminine aspects

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:10%
of creation.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.018 align:middle line:90%
But what really is that?

00:19:06.018 --> 00:19:07.810 align:middle line:84%
The more we get to know
the high priestess,

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:12.160 align:middle line:84%
the more we realize she's just
as magical as the magician.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Yet she's also more
subtle and ethereal.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:10%
Here, the high
priestess is clearly

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:10%
connected with the moon.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.340 align:middle line:10%
She has crescent moons at her
feet and also in her crown,

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:10%
representing all
the lunar cycles

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.170 align:middle line:10%
and the principle of rhythm.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.780 align:middle line:84%
First of all, she is
ruled by number two.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And the number two
represents balance.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.430 align:middle line:84%
It's receptive, and it's
feminine as an even number.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.510 align:middle line:90%
Number two is a mirror.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:90%
It duplicates.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.450 align:middle line:90%
It copies.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:90%
It reflects.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the acts of
transcription and reproduction.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.740 align:middle line:84%
Two introduces polarity
and even duality,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:84%
whereas one was
all just the unity.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.070 align:middle line:90%
But now we have two.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.650 align:middle line:90%
So we have polarity and duality.

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And let's get further
into her symbolism

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.690 align:middle line:84%
as we explore now the
imagery of the Tarot card.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing you notice
about the high priestess

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.900 align:middle line:10%
is that while she's in this
position of high esteem,

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:10%
she's rather young
in appearance.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:10%
Her inner robes
and her head scarf

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:10%
are white, representing her
purity and her virginity.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:10%
Her outer robe is blue,
which flows like a waterfall.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And this represents a
very important concept

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the stream
of consciousness that flows

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.160 align:middle line:90%
through the rest of the deck.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere that we see water
in the remaining cards,

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
the original source
of that water

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
is the robe of the
high priestess.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
The water represents that prima
materia, the root of matter.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And according to ancient
hermetic teachings,

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
what causes matter
to manifest is

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.940 align:middle line:90%
the thoughts of the one mind.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:84%
This is known as the
first hermetic principle

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.040 align:middle line:84%
of mentalism, which says
that "the All is mind.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:10%
The universe is mental."

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But the high priestess is
more like the subconscious

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
or the unconscious aspect
of this universal mind.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the magician, who's the
active or conscious aspect

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.600 align:middle line:84%
of that mind, while the high
priestess is the subconscious.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And the magician is the
one who applies his will

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and concentration to
determine what manifests out,

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.680 align:middle line:84%
whereas the high priestess is
the receptive substance who

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.670 align:middle line:84%
then births whatever seeds
he plants within her.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:10%
On her own, she is simply
pure virgin potential.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:10%
Notice that her robe
flows in waves of energy.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.720 align:middle line:10%
This represents the
principle of vibration.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.270 align:middle line:10%
It says that "all things
vibrate; all things

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:54.910 align:middle line:10%
move," which we know to be true
as well from science today.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.480 align:middle line:10%
Now, the high priestess's crown
shows the phases of the moon,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:10%
referring to the
cycles of nature

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:10%
and the principle of rhythm.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:10%
This crown also symbolizes
the Egyptian goddess Isis.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Isis was the original
high priestess

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Egyptian
mystery schools.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And some of her legends
say that she taught women

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
how to harness the
cycles of nature,

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:84%
how to dig canals from the
Nile out to water the fields.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:10%
And she was said to possess
the secret name of Ra,

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.700 align:middle line:10%
giving her the power to
create, to bestow life,

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:10%
and to alchemically
transmute anything.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.210 align:middle line:10%
And notice the
horns of her crown.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
On the high
priestess, these horns

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
touch two of the pomegranates
on the veil behind her.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:10%
And this veil is
very interesting.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.380 align:middle line:10%
It's stretched
between two pillars.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:10%
And on the veil is an embroidery
of pomegranates representing

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.860 align:middle line:10%
feminine, sexuality, as well
as palm leaves, which represent

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:10%
the masculine sexuality.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And this relates to
the hermetic principle

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:84%
of gender, that interplay of
masculine and feminine energies

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:90%
that are needed for creation.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.120 align:middle line:10%
These symbols are arranged in
the form of the Tree of Life,

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:10%
reminding us that this is
the pattern of all things.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And the horns of her crown touch
the supernal triad of the tree,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
connecting her to
the celestial realms.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Behind the veil is a vast
sea of cosmic mind stuff.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And on her chest is
an equal-arm cross,

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.470 align:middle line:84%
which represents this balance
of as above, so below,

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.230 align:middle line:84%
that principle of
correspondence.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:10%
That equal-arm cross also
represents the balance

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.620 align:middle line:10%
of the four elements.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, the high priestess
sits inside a temple.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.630 align:middle line:84%
And she sits upon
a cubicle stone.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.350 align:middle line:10%
The cube represents
the soul, or it also

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.140 align:middle line:10%
represents the
container for creation

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.380 align:middle line:10%
or the formation of matter.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.800 align:middle line:10%
As the high priestess sits, she
sits between these two pillars.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.200 align:middle line:10%
But she in the middle is
representing the middle pillar,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.200 align:middle line:10%
while the two white and black
pillars on either side of her,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.200 align:middle line:10%
which are labeled
J and B, represent

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:10%
the principle of polarity.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:10%
These two pillars are
called Jachin and Boaz,

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.410 align:middle line:10%
the famous pillars
of Solomon's Temple,

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:27.040 align:middle line:10%
and the two side pillars
of the Tree of Life.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:10%
Now, the tops of the
pillars are lotus flowers,

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:10%
which represent
here the blooming

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:10%
of feminine subconscious force.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the scroll in
the high priestess's lap

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
says Tora on it, which
represents and relates

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.440 align:middle line:90%
to the laws.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And here it's both the physical
and the spiritual laws,

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:84%
the laws that
operate our universe.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:84%
This is also a symbol of
the hermetic principle

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.460 align:middle line:90%
of the law of cause and effect.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, inside her scroll is
the memory or the recordings

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.460 align:middle line:90%
of all things.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:84%
As you can start
to see, there is

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.590 align:middle line:84%
a lot of rich symbolism
in this card here.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very layered.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:13.030 align:middle line:84%
This one image contains
symbols for all seven

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:18.360 align:middle line:84%
hermetic principles that govern
the creation of our universe.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, what is the high
priestess and all this imagery

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.670 align:middle line:90%
of her card trying to teach us?

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, her main
lesson is that there

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
is a constant flow of polar
energies in our lives,

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.840 align:middle line:84%
all of which serve a
purpose and are according

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.010 align:middle line:90%
to the laws of the universe.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:84%
She's the universal mind, that
great cosmic and quantum sea

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:43.050 align:middle line:84%
within which we live,
move, and have our being.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.730 align:middle line:84%
She's responsive
to and reflective

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.070 align:middle line:84%
of self-consciousness,
or the energy that

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:middle line:90%
comes from the magician.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And her responsiveness
is what makes the magic

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.950 align:middle line:90%
of the magician even possible.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.760 align:middle line:84%
And the best
methods that we have

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.500 align:middle line:84%
for tuning into her our
meditation and silence.

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Listening to your
inner high priestess

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:84%
allows you to know the
greater whole of who you are

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and to get clear about
what do I really want?

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's go through some
of her other correspondences.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:19.040 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, the high
priestess relates

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.930 align:middle line:10%
to the element of water.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:24.200 align:middle line:10%
She's the cup, the
container of everything.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.136 align:middle line:10%
And the waters of her robe flow
through the rest of the deck.

00:26:28.136 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:10%
Now, the secret name,
or the esoteric title

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:10%
of a high priestess,
she's called

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:10%
the Priestess of the
Silver Star, which

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:10%
is an allegory to the moon.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Her astrological
correspondence is the moon.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The moon governs the tides
of our monthly cycles

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and it influences our feelings,
our emotional reactions,

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:51.740 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
The cycles of the
moon really govern

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.400 align:middle line:84%
our subconscious, as well as
our psychological undercurrents

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and the various
rhythms of our life.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
to note that

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
similar to how the moon gives
off no light of its own--

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:07.460 align:middle line:84%
it only reflects the
light of the sun--

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.940 align:middle line:84%
well, it's the same with how
our subconscious mind reflects

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.650 align:middle line:90%
the light of our spirit.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, take note of where the moon
appears in your natal chart.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
This will show you the
influence of the moon

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
on your emotional nature, how
you express your emotions,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as perhaps
some relationship

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.010 align:middle line:90%
to mother figures in your life.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, the moon
rules the sign of Cancer.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And it also rules
the fourth house,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.260 align:middle line:84%
which is the house of
home and maternal figures.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, positively
in her expression,

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
the moon is sensitive,
caring, and nurturing.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But in the negative side,
she can be grasping, moody,

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and irritable.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And some other attributes and
key words the high priestess

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.080 align:middle line:90%
include intuition, independence.

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
She's the gateway to
knowledge, and she

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:90%
reveals hidden mysteries.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, the strengths
are the balanced or the pure

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:84%
expression, whereas
the weaknesses

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
are when we get into
imbalances or distortions of it

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.490 align:middle line:90%
being too much or too little.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's explore her
weaknesses for a moment.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The vices of the high priestess
include inertia, rigidity,

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and self-made obstacles.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And some other weaknesses
that can show up

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.680 align:middle line:84%
in the shadow side
of the high priestess

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:84%
include an inability to trust
our intuition, also not having

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:84%
a good relationship with
the feminine side, which

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
might show up as a dislike
towards other women,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:84%
or it could also be showing up
as issues with feminine elders

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and authority figures.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we acknowledge
our shadow side

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and how that part of it
is showing up within us,

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.450 align:middle line:84%
that's when we can start
to transform it and bring

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.280 align:middle line:90%
the shadow to the light.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We can start to do that
work of spiritual alchemy

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and reveal the gifts that
are hidden within the shadow.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So some of the ways to
bring the shadow into light

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
is trusting your intuition
and making wise decisions

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.660 align:middle line:90%
based upon your intuition.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Other benefits that
are gained by working

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.210 align:middle line:84%
with the high priestess include
helping us with self-reflection

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:90%
and introspection.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.660 align:middle line:84%
She encourages us
to bring awareness

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.730 align:middle line:84%
to our subconscious
and our connection

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:90%
to the collective unconscious.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does the high
priestess show up in our life

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.900 align:middle line:90%
here and now?

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of times when you've
either been or encountered

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:90%
the high priestess in your life.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Consider also your relationship
with female authority figures

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.160 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Do you have good
relationships with them?

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:90%
If not, why not?

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.660 align:middle line:10%
And what might you need
to do to heal or clean up

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:10%
your perception of them?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.420 align:middle line:10%
At some level, these women
represent the high priestess

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.060 align:middle line:10%
energy to you.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, as adults,
our task is to find

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.950 align:middle line:84%
the balance between
the dualities

00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:59.960 align:middle line:90%
and the polarities of life.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.000 align:middle line:84%
We're here to become the
middle pillar between them,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
just like the high
priestess who sits

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:84%
at that middle pillar between
the pillars of polarity.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is true whether
you're a man or a woman.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
We all have both feminine and
masculine qualities within us.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And the more you come to
recognize the high priestess

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.240 align:middle line:84%
in your life, the
more it will then also

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.810 align:middle line:84%
connect you with one
of your parallel lives,

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.985 align:middle line:84%
where the high priestess
is the dominant archetype.

00:30:25.985 --> 00:30:28.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, what might
our parallel life

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:31.580 align:middle line:84%
be like under the archetype
of the high priestess?

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, in times past,
we might actually

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
be a high priestess
living in the cloisters

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.810 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient temples.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.950 align:middle line:84%
But if we're looking for
more contemporary examples,

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.910 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we could also
think of a female scientist

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:48.890 align:middle line:84%
who is seeking to understand
the laws of the universe

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.210 align:middle line:90%
and matter.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.510 align:middle line:10%
She spends most of her days in
the cloisters of a laboratory

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.660 align:middle line:10%
or the academic halls
of a university.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.120 align:middle line:84%
But despite her
role as a leader,

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.640 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps because
of it, she often

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.810 align:middle line:84%
finds herself alone, with very
few people she can confide in.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But she must rely on herself
and her own inner knowing.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It can be a long and lonely
path under the archetype

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.610 align:middle line:90%
of high priestess.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.180 align:middle line:84%
But she'll find her
magician at some point.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, she has
developed the ability

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to nourish herself from
within through the meaning

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.525 align:middle line:90%
that she gets out of her work.

00:31:28.525 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And she also has a deep love for
harmony, beauty, and balance,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.750 align:middle line:90%
which she brings to her life.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:10%
And by working with
the high priestess

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:10%
and invoking her
energies into our life,

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:44.090 align:middle line:10%
we, too, can awaken our
intuition and inner knowing.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.400 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:53.900 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring
the mysteries of Tarot

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.930 align:middle line:84%
and our
multi-dimensionality with me

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:03.730 align:middle line:84%
in this episode of
"Mystery Teachings."

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:07.000 align:middle line:90%
