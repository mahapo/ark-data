00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.200 align:middle line:10%
Humanity is poised to make
a great evolutionary leap

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.090 align:middle line:10%
in how we live.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:10%
What is this leap that
we are preparing to make?

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this
series, we've explored

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.080 align:middle line:84%
what is possible
for us as humans

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.870 align:middle line:84%
when we fully activate
our potential,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
when we harness more
of our brain capacity

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
consciously, and expand our
perceptions as we ascend

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and integrate the
light body or what

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah has called the Adam
Kadmon, the godlike human.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:84%
And as we become more aware
of our multidimensionality,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
mastering how we process
stimulus and information,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and take all these things into
action to change our lives,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
all of this is leading us
towards our next evolutionary

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:90%
leap as humans.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's happening both at
a level of consciousness

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
as well as through our
technologies in the world.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:84%
This is where science and
metaphysics truly meet.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:84%
They're both pointing toward
the same thing, something

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
that has been foretold through
many of our science fiction

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.840 align:middle line:84%
films and stories as well as
our spiritual philosophies

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.560 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
It's pointing
towards the next step

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
of how we are meant to
become galactic humans.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean,
becoming a galactic human?

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And what might it
really look like?

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, in many ways,
it has already begun.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And we have shifted
our perspective

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
from beyond just life on
planet Earth to now expanding

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.530 align:middle line:84%
our minds to what is possible
beyond our limited ideas of who

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:90%
we are as humans.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Truly becoming fully
awakened galactic humans

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.490 align:middle line:84%
requires that we move beyond
just an Earth-centric point

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.660 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
the average person

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.970 align:middle line:84%
does not have much awareness
of the galaxy, let alone

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:90%
our bigger picture of reality.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't identify as
being galactic citizens

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
or live from that perspective
of multidimensional being.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:84%
Humans can very much
tend to be egocentric.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we are
also human-centric and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.960 align:middle line:90%
Earth-centric.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's highly probable
that humans of Earth

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.380 align:middle line:84%
are just one civilization within
a diverse and abundant universe

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of full, conscious,
and aware beings.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
possible that several

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
of those alien
civilizations have

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.750 align:middle line:84%
technology and
spiritual awareness that

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.690 align:middle line:90%
go far beyond our own.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
Could a world of united
star systems and planetary

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
communities, like we see
in things like "Star Trek,"

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
could it be a real possibility?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:84%
If so, these beings are
likely waiting for us

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:84%
to evolve to move beyond
our primitive perspective

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.790 align:middle line:84%
of separation and limitation
before the human race can

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
become active members of such
a greater galactic community.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:90%
How likely is this?

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, while traditional science
hasn't yet acknowledged life

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
beyond Earth, the
statistics overwhelmingly

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
suggest that humans are
not alone in the universe.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Current estimates say
that our sun is just 1

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.330 align:middle line:84%
of about 100 billion stars
in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
About 7% to 10% of
those 100 billion stars

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
are similar to our sun and
have at least one planet

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
orbiting them.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Of those, the number that
have potentially habitable

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
conditions range anywhere
from 1.9 billion up

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to 40 billion Earth-like
planets in our galaxy alone.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
In addition, our
universe is estimated

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
to contain nearly two
trillion galaxies.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:84%
If just 1% of those galaxies
are anything like ours,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:84%
that means there could be 20
billion galaxies that each host

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:90%
billions of Earth-like planets.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
This brings the amount of
potential Earth-like planets

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:84%
in our universe to
staggering numbers.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.740 align:middle line:84%
And the odds that there
is life beyond Earth

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:90%
are extremely high.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But what is the likelihood
that life on other planets

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
is as advanced or more
advanced than humans on Earth?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth is dated to be
4.6 billion years old.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And about 75% of what are
called the Goldilocks planets

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:84%
are, on average, one to
two billion years older

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:90%
than our Earth.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And some are even up to
six billion years older.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So these planets have had
significantly more time

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:84%
for the evolution of
life and consciousness.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
Humans of Earth
are quite primitive

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.240 align:middle line:84%
actually on this
scale of advancement.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.940 align:middle line:84%
But it gives us a look at
where we might be heading.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
In their search for
extraterrestrial civilizations,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.520 align:middle line:84%
scientists devised a
classification system

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
based on the expected
energy consumption

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:90%
of advanced civilizations.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:10%
Physicist and
futurist, Michio Kaku,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:10%
explores this
classification system

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.910 align:middle line:10%
in his book, "Parallel Worlds."

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:10%
In it, he describes four
types of civilizations.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
A type-1 civilization
is able to harness

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.980 align:middle line:84%
100% of the solar energy
striking their planet, which

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:84%
comes out to about 10 to the
power 16 watts of energy.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
This ability to harness
planetary energy

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
is considered as mastery
over the planetary system.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it would include the
ability to control the weather,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.070 align:middle line:84%
change the course of hurricanes,
and build cities even

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.470 align:middle line:90%
on the ocean.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
As we move beyond that, type-2
and type-3 civilizations,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:84%
they go into harnessing the
energy of an entire star

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.350 align:middle line:90%
or solar system.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually
type 3 is harnessing

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
a portion of the galaxy and
multiple stars in the galaxy.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then the highest
classification,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
a type-4 civilization,
has figured out

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:84%
how to directly harness the
energy of the quantum vacuum.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, the human
civilization here on Earth

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:84%
doesn't even yet qualify
as a type-1 society

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.360 align:middle line:90%
according to this criteria.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:84%
We're more like a
0.7 type of society

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
with how much energy we're
consuming and the way in which

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:90%
we're consuming that energy.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
But we are progressing towards
that leap to a type-1 society

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
within this century
towards greater

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.440 align:middle line:90%
mastery over our own planet.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.830 align:middle line:84%
We see this progression through
current emerging technologies

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and the trends of
global economy.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And we see this through
movement towards things

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
like greater connection,
transition towards more

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.100 align:middle line:90%
global communities.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.500 align:middle line:84%
The internet of things
is a good example

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.930 align:middle line:84%
of an emerging technology
that is bringing

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:84%
us closer to type-1 type
status with the ability

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to create a planetary
communications system.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Other indicators of this shift
would include less emphasis

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.360 align:middle line:90%
on borders between nations.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
International trade,
travel, and global economies

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
will trend more towards
connected and integrated

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.000 align:middle line:90%
systems.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And we also see
more united efforts

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:84%
to address things like
pollution on a global scale.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:10%
For us, to overcome the
challenges currently facing

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.120 align:middle line:10%
humanity, we must
overcome the forces

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.420 align:middle line:10%
of what are called
man-made entropy, things

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.490 align:middle line:10%
like the greenhouse-gas
effect that

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:10%
is truly from our input
into the environment--

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:10%
pollution, nuclear
proliferation, radicalism,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:10%
disease, all these things
that humans have contributed.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Michio Kaku describes
this transition

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
from our current position to
a type-1 society as perilous.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
He calls our current
generation, though,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
generations to walk the Earth.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:84%
The question we now
face as a collective

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.130 align:middle line:84%
is can we come together
and heal ourselves

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and our global community to
create a planetary civilization

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.764 align:middle line:84%
and take our leap to
becoming galactic citizens.

00:08:36.764 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Can we create a world of
peace and respect for all?

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.450 align:middle line:84%
This is part of our
current progression

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
as we master ourselves
and step closer

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:84%
toward living as
galactic humans.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
The potential is there,
but it is up to us

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:90%
to choose this shift.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:84%
This shift, however,
will not succeed

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
if it is purely based upon
the advancements of just

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:90%
science and technology.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
In order for us to succeed
without destroying ourselves

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
first, we must make a
shift in consciousness,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual evolution, to access
greater wisdom and awareness

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.470 align:middle line:90%
of our connectedness.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:84%
This paradigm shift requires
both a technological

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual evolution.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
We must widen our view of the
fundamental nature of reality

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.280 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the
quantum world view

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and the spiritual
awareness, to harness

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
the principles of
complementarity, entanglement,

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.590 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, and to
understand that we are all one.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.860 align:middle line:84%
We are all connected
and entangled.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.660 align:middle line:84%
As humans, we tend to be very
attached to our physical world

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and body and to progressing
at only the physical levels.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.190 align:middle line:84%
But in this leaping process
towards our next evolution,

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:90%
this will not suffice.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We must fully acknowledge
that our true self

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:90%
is beyond the physical.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.480 align:middle line:84%
This physical body
is not who we are.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:90%
The body is just a vehicle.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Who we are, our true
life, is eternal spirit

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.820 align:middle line:90%
or intelligent mind.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
In order to widen our view of
ourselves beyond the physical,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:84%
to take into account the
progression of spirit

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, we must look
at this much bigger picture.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.800 align:middle line:84%
In looking at the
bigger picture,

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
we've been exploring ideas of
holograms, parallel realities,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:90%
and the multiverse.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
If this reality is a
hologram, the source of it

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:49.420 align:middle line:84%
all, the true reality is being
projected from somewhere.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And that place is
what metaphysicians

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.110 align:middle line:90%
call the Great Central Sun.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.770 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
The science of Kabbalah
reveals that there

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.580 align:middle line:84%
are 22 holograms projected
into physical density

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.640 align:middle line:84%
according to the pattern of
the Tree of Life and its 22

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:90%
pathways.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
That's 22 different archetypes
or holographic encodings

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.980 align:middle line:84%
of our true self all running
in parallel with each other.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Our true self resides at
the Great Central Sun.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And let's just imagine being
at that Great Central Sun

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:84%
and then it sends out 22 rays
or archetypes or holograms.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Each one of those
22 rays anchors then

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:90%
on a different planet or star.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And then each of those
send a projection of itself

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.630 align:middle line:84%
back to all the other
21 planets, thereby

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
creating an intricate
network and all linking back

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:90%
to all aspects of the self.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Each location has all
22 information templates

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
now from the original
22 archetypes.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.830 align:middle line:10%
And these are then projected
down into the physical density

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:10%
levels of those planets or
stars, which then results

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.240 align:middle line:10%
in what we can call 22 parallel
realities that live out

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:10%
on that single planet.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.010 align:middle line:10%
In other words, we are
galactic beings already.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.060 align:middle line:84%
Yet in our reality here now,
with our current consciousness

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and awareness of ourself,
we've basically forgotten this,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.100 align:middle line:84%
or we don't have
full memory of it.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.680 align:middle line:84%
The question now becomes, how
do we awaken to that level?

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And what does this look
like when we live our lives

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.350 align:middle line:90%
as galactic beings?

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.060 align:middle line:84%
How can we make this
paradigm shift here and now?

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's really paint the picture
here of what this looks like.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:84%
As we expand our
conscious awareness

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and enhance our ability
to perceive our reality,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:84%
we're going to begin making
more conscious choices that

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.220 align:middle line:84%
affect every part of
how we live our life.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
From the food we
eat, to the clothes

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
we buy, to our
environment and how

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.880 align:middle line:84%
we establish our homes and
our architecture, the dynamics

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
of work and relationships
and how we show up

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:84%
in those relationships,
how we take care

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
of our body and
our health, we will

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.010 align:middle line:84%
begin making more conscious
choices with a deeper

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
understanding of our
interconnected and

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.810 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
self and what is

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
needed to bring greater
harmony and balance

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:90%
to all aspects of our life.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.760 align:middle line:84%
One area that we're
already seeing that shift

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.080 align:middle line:84%
is in the overall trends towards
more conscious eating choices.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And while we're
not fully there yet

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what it would take
to live galactic being fully,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
we do see that people are
waking up and figuring out

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:84%
what the right diet is
for their body type.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
As our bodies transform
to higher levels of light,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.720 align:middle line:84%
we have a harder time digesting
the pollution and density

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of old dietary ways.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.090 align:middle line:84%
We are moving towards greater
awareness of our connection

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.645 align:middle line:84%
to everything, including each
other, animals, and other life

00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:06.190 align:middle line:90%
forms on this planet.

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to honor all of that
as we become more aware.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:84%
The more we shift towards
fully awakened galactic beings,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:84%
the greater our sense of
personal responsibility

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.880 align:middle line:84%
becomes to protect the
lives of all of our brothers

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and sisters, whether
we're talking

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:90%
about animals or each other.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.530 align:middle line:84%
There's also a couple of
technological advancements

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:90%
supporting this kind of a trend.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.920 align:middle line:84%
One example might include
how scientists are now

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.710 align:middle line:84%
starting to grow meat
in the laboratories

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.850 align:middle line:90%
from cellular cultures.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of weird.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:84%
But what's nice about it is
that it's eliminating the need

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:90%
to kill animals for food.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
We also have systems like
hydroponics and the ability

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.150 align:middle line:90%
to grow our own food at home.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And then there's other
things like 3D printing

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.362 align:middle line:84%
that's coming in that's another
game-changing technology.

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:84%
But when talking
about technologies,

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
we do encounter a lot of
fear around certain types

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.240 align:middle line:84%
of new technologies
and the impact

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that they might have on
us and future generations.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.006 align:middle line:84%
And these are things that we
need to be educated about.

00:15:14.006 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
But as galactic
beings, we also have

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:21.270 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the influence
that we have over ourselves

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:90%
and our environment.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, these
are things that we

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
can do to overcome our
environmental conditions.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.050 align:middle line:84%
When we live a
healthy lifestyle,

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:35.670 align:middle line:84%
with our choices, our attitude,
our diet, exercise, lowering

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:84%
our stress levels,
all of these things

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.460 align:middle line:84%
affect the expression of
our genetic potential.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.900 align:middle line:84%
There are actually genes within
our DNA for super immunity.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:84%
There are genes for complete
regeneration of our whole body.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.430 align:middle line:84%
There is power in
potential within us

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that all we need to do is
tap into and harness in order

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
to really take our
next evolutionary leap.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.840 align:middle line:90%
We can be aware of the issues.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.170 align:middle line:90%
But don't be in fear of them.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
We are not victims to
outer circumstances.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:90%
The power is truly within us.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:84%
We just have to figure
out how to tap into it.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Reclaiming ancient wisdom
teachings and practices

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.430 align:middle line:90%
is the key here.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And yet we must also bring
these into our modern world

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and adapt them to a
modern way of life.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.840 align:middle line:84%
This is about valuing ourselves
and using the practices

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.390 align:middle line:84%
consistently in our
lives so that we

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
can take a step into
our greater potential

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and push that boundary
toward achieving

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:90%
more of who we truly are.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
This is about our evolution and
progression of consciousness

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.450 align:middle line:90%
here in the physical dimension.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Life and our path of
spiritual evolution

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.480 align:middle line:90%
can often be like a maze.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:84%
We wander through
that maze on our own.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And we can encounter pitfalls
and probably and possibly

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:90%
get lost.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Or we can find a
guide who can help

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.819 align:middle line:84%
us navigate the way through,
a guide who knows the path,

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and can help us get to that
ultimate goal of finding

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.547 align:middle line:90%
the center of the self.

00:17:15.547 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
The ancient mystery
school traditions

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:90%
have charted the map.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.130 align:middle line:84%
They've walked this maze
for thousands of years.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.310 align:middle line:84%
They've handed down this
map through oral tradition

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:84%
in teaching generation
after generation

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
how to navigate the way through.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Working with a guide
is about finding

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.320 align:middle line:84%
someone who knows their
way through the maze

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:90%
and can help us navigate.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
But we still have to
walk it ourselves.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:90%
We still have to do the work.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.080 align:middle line:90%
It is a faster way.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:90%
But it's not a shortcut.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.180 align:middle line:90%
There's a difference.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:84%
How do we discern for ourselves
what the right path is for me

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:90%
and who is the right guide?

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
To do that, we must
tune into our heart.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And here in our heart, we
can ask, what do I really

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
want and will this lead me
to my highest potential?

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
tools for awakening

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:84%
our galactic potential is to
activate our DNA blueprints.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:84%
The central mainframe of
our etheric blueprints

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:26.390 align:middle line:84%
coincides with the master cell
of the body, the pineal gland.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.790 align:middle line:84%
When activating
our DNA blueprints,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:84%
we must wake up the Tree of Life
within that etheric field that

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%
relates to the pineal gland.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:10%
The Tree of Life is the core
sacred geometry around which

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:10%
our DNA is built. As
we turn on its codes,

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:10%
it begins to transmit
vibrational signals

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.530 align:middle line:10%
through the pineal gland, which
then sends out those signals

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.940 align:middle line:10%
to the rest of the body.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the first
level of activation.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.640 align:middle line:84%
It's like turning
on the mainframe

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
or getting the engine
running, so to speak.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.480 align:middle line:84%
To get a sense of this
activation process,

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
let's look closer
at the Tree of Life

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and the Western mystery school
teachings about our DNA.

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:10%
The Tree of Life is
multidimensional.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:10%
The two-dimensional Tree
of Life has 10 sefirot,

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:10%
plus a hidden one called Da'at.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And then there's also
the source, or what

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:90%
we call Ein Sof in Kabbalah.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:24.160 align:middle line:84%
This brings the total
of key aspects to 12.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:10%
This pattern is found at
both the physical level

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.940 align:middle line:10%
and the spiritual
or etheric level.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.300 align:middle line:84%
So that actually brings it to
12 physical and 12 spiritual

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
aspects to our DNA, which
makes it 24 key receptors

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.090 align:middle line:84%
or codes that must be activated
within our DNA blueprints.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
The Tree of Life also has
a fractal nature, meaning,

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:51.400 align:middle line:84%
within each part, there is a
repetition of the whole pattern

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.750 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.410 align:middle line:84%
That means there are also
12 levels within each

00:19:56.410 --> 00:20:00.700 align:middle line:84%
of those main 12 receptors,
both physical and spiritual.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.470 align:middle line:90%
So now, we're talking 24.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.970 align:middle line:84%
A good way to think of this is
to imagine a 12-story building.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.340 align:middle line:84%
On the 11th floor
is the mainframe.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:10%
And that mainframe,
let's say it has

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.310 align:middle line:10%
12 power stations
that supply the rest

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:18.260 align:middle line:10%
of the building with power.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
In order to turn on the
lights for the building,

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:84%
first, we need to switch on
the power in the mainframe.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.520 align:middle line:10%
That first level of DNA
activation is what does that.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.280 align:middle line:84%
It goes into the
mainframe room and turns

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
on those power stations
for the rest of a building

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%
to be able to power up.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a method that has
been known and utilized

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
by the mystery school lineages
for thousands of years.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:84%
The next level that
goes in and turns

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.350 align:middle line:84%
on all the lights
in all 12 floors

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and all systems of
those floors has only

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:90%
recently become available.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we call
the galactic activations.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.420 align:middle line:84%
The leap from
getting the mainframe

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
on through the
first DNA activation

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
level to then getting
the whole building

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:84%
on with the galactic activation
levels is truly a quantum leap.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.070 align:middle line:84%
With this one, all
systems are go.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And yet to activate to
this new galactic level,

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:84%
it must rest upon the foundation
of the more ancient techniques

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:90%
for activating our DNA codes.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
Ancient wisdom now meets
new paradigm energy.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
We now have the methods to work
with our complete energy system

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:36.290 align:middle line:84%
to work within our
blueprints to activate

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:90%
these galactic potentials.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:84%
But we still have to
integrate it physically.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.580 align:middle line:84%
There is actually
a turnover rate

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.100 align:middle line:84%
that happens within
our physical body.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, constantly every
day, we're shedding old cells

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:90%
and generating new ones.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And within about seven years
from today, most of our body

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
will be entirely new.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.930 align:middle line:84%
When we turn on the codes to
more of our DNA potential,

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.350 align:middle line:84%
that starts a process of new
instructions being sent out

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:84%
by our DNA to all the
cells in our body.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:12.860 align:middle line:84%
As the cells renew over
time, these new codes

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.740 align:middle line:90%
get integrated more and more.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Our body literally has this
alchemical factory within it.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:84%
True alchemy is the process
of activating that Adam Kadmon

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
body, that rainbow body,
that galactic body to become

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.974 align:middle line:90%
a fully awakened human.

00:22:31.974 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
It is both a spiritual
and physical process.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is not about
one or the other.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:84%
True alchemy is working
with both the physical

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.940 align:middle line:84%
If we try to take a purely
physical approach with alchemy,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
then we're basically becoming
like chemists in a lab.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
If, on the other hand, we take
a purely spiritual approach,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:90%
well, it's basically philosophy.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is about
both, heightening

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.190 align:middle line:84%
our states of
consciousness and awakening

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.130 align:middle line:84%
more of our full potential
as spiritual beings

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
while also integrating that into
our lives here in the physical

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:84%
and working that alchemy
at a physical level.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:90%
How do we apply it?

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.700 align:middle line:84%
By paying attention
to natural law,

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.520 align:middle line:84%
to align with the flow of
nature and be in harmony

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.870 align:middle line:84%
with that, be in tune with
our body, with nature, to be

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.080 align:middle line:84%
aware of what we're consuming
and of our environment,

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:84%
realizing the effects,
yet not getting

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:84%
into fear about
all these factors

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:90%
we deal with in our world.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:40.930 align:middle line:84%
The first principle of
Hermetics says, the all is mine.

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, if we can
achieve coherent states

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.820 align:middle line:84%
within the mind,
such as by having

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that attitude of gratitude
or love, joy, and positivity,

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
those are going to uplift and
transmute the lower vibrations

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:90%
into higher ones.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said that,
at the same time,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
we can't just think
our way through things.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.260 align:middle line:84%
We have to act in
accordance with natural law.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.260 align:middle line:84%
If we try to say, well, it's
all about mind over matter

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and then we abuse
our body thinking,

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll just transmute
it with my mind,

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.190 align:middle line:90%
well, that's simply arrogance.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.230 align:middle line:84%
That's not living in
harmony with the laws

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
of nature, which are created
by the laws of spirit,

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:90%
or the divine.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We have to honor the
body as a temple.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And how we do that is by living
a healthy and balanced life

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.230 align:middle line:84%
and working with pure
and uplifting vibrations.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So becoming galactic
beings is a way of life.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the lifestyle choices
and actions already mentioned,

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:84%
what can we do now
to start awakening

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.780 align:middle line:90%
to more of our galactic being.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the path of
becoming a galactic being

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:84%
is about getting into
our multidimensionality.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
One way to start doing
that is to learn to control

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.100 align:middle line:90%
the energies of our octagon.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.560 align:middle line:84%
The octagon is related
to our Tree of Life.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
We've explored much
of the Tree of Life,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
both in the two-dimensional
and three-dimensional forms.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is truly
the master pattern.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.210 align:middle line:90%
It is the core.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Our octagon is formed by the
three-dimensional Tree of Life

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:90%
as it rotates around us.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:24.310 align:middle line:90%
It is part of our energy system.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.250 align:middle line:10%
Recall, with the
three-dimensional Tree,

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.100 align:middle line:10%
that there are four outer
pillars, two in front

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.700 align:middle line:10%
and two behind, that then
surround a middle pillar.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Within our energy
field around the body,

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:84%
these four pillars represent
the four cardinal directions

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%
and the four elements.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:90%
And then they rotate around us.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And as they rotate at,
let's say, 45 degrees,

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.170 align:middle line:84%
they then generate
the sub directions.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So the 4 cardinal directions
and the 4 sub directions

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:84%
then becomes 8, which
forms an octagon around us.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
This octagon is
more like a tube.

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a tube with eight sides.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.270 align:middle line:90%
This is a Kabbalistic teaching.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:84%
But we also find it
in the Daoist system

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.730 align:middle line:90%
with the I Ching and the Bagua.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.080 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of correlation
between these two systems.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:15.330 align:middle line:10%
The Kabbalistic Tree of Life
in the three-dimensional form

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:10%
and the I Ching, they both
relate with their numerology

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:10%
and also with the DNA as
we've exported other episodes.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:27.210 align:middle line:84%
The Tree of Life is more
than the octagon around us.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet we can work
with this octagon.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
As we do, we are
communicating with our DNA

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:90%
to help wake it up.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And we are also
becoming more in tune

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.590 align:middle line:90%
with our multidimensionality.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.480 align:middle line:84%
This octagon eventually becomes
like a "beam me up, Scotty"

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.840 align:middle line:84%
type of connection between
our inner self and the galaxy.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So for this exercise,
we are connecting

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.440 align:middle line:90%
to galactic energies.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And we can begin by sitting
or standing and visualizing

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:04.650 align:middle line:84%
ourselves inside the
three-dimensional Tree of Life.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:84%
See or feel that tree
rotating around us clockwise

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:11.910 align:middle line:84%
as seen from above,
meaning to our right,

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and become aware of how
this then forms the octagon

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.760 align:middle line:90%
tube around us.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Next, we can imagine that
tube extends all the way up

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to the Great Central Sun through
the core of the Milky Way

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:90%
Galaxy.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Next, take time to fill
the octagon with light

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:90%
from the galactic source.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.690 align:middle line:84%
See that light coming down, the
high frequency rays of light

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the
center of the Milky Way

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.520 align:middle line:84%
galaxy, all the way
from that Great Central

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Sun beyond our galaxy, and
allow that high-potency light

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to come in to fill this
tube, to fill our octagon.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And as it does, it
fills our whole being.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Then imagine star
dust and cosmic energy

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.980 align:middle line:84%
coming down into
our auric field.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Hold that image and feel
this energy flowing in.

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Let it even flow through
your nervous system

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and into every cell of
your body and into the DNA.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:84%
We are the microcosm
and the macrocosm.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.960 align:middle line:90%
The macrocosm is within us.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Our body is the cosmos.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, see the star dust
and galactic light

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.430 align:middle line:84%
penetrating from the
DNA all the way down

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:90%
to the subatomic levels.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:43.580 align:middle line:84%
This awakens our higher
connection and potential

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.390 align:middle line:84%
within, awakening us to
atomic consciousness.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.290 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:84%
We can do this visualization
with the octagon

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:58.100 align:middle line:84%
every morning to activate
our conscious awareness

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.470 align:middle line:90%
of our galactic nature.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:03.830 align:middle line:84%
For optimal effect,
when this meditation

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is done between the hours
of 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM,

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.710 align:middle line:84%
meaning one hour before,
during, and after sunrise,

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:16.160 align:middle line:84%
it gives us an even more
potent window of opportunity

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to connect to the
galactic energies.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the time when the
galactic energies come

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.440 align:middle line:84%
through the most
clearly as the rays

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.550 align:middle line:84%
of first light from the
sun shine upon our land.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:34.070 align:middle line:84%
This is when we can have the
most undisturbed energetic axis

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:39.070 align:middle line:84%
to the galactic,
universal energies.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.740 align:middle line:84%
This is an exciting
time to be alive.

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.000 align:middle line:84%
We are living in an age
where we have the technology

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.290 align:middle line:84%
to create a world of peace, to
provide solutions for things

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
like starvation and poverty
and illness around the planet.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And it is not a coincidence
that we are here now.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Each of us, we signed up
to be here at this time

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to play our part in assisting
in this great leap of humanity

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.350 align:middle line:84%
towards achieving
our full potential.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.870 align:middle line:90%
This is our destiny.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.850 align:middle line:90%
And we came prepared.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The task is now with each of us
to tune in and make this shift

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:19.860 align:middle line:84%
within our life, to overcome
whatever limitations we've

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.590 align:middle line:84%
set up for ourselves
or from our life,

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:27.570 align:middle line:84%
and live now an empowered
life, making conscious choices

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:31.170 align:middle line:84%
with a realization of our
multidimensional being.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we discover
how to truly harness

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:90%
the power of intention.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:40.230 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:84%
of our human potential with
me in this episode of "Mystery

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Teachings."
