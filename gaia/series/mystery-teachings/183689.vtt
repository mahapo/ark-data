>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever been
with a loved one

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and felt your heart open up
with a rush of warmth and joy?

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.270 align:middle line:10%
Most of us have had that
kind of beautiful experience

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.590 align:middle line:10%
at some point in our lives.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And doesn't it seem like the
heart has its own intelligence

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:90%
in those moments?

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.890 align:middle line:84%
In our modern age,
scientists have

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
searched for the seat
of consciousness,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
primarily by examining the
functions of the brain.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:84%
But is consciousness contained
only within our brain?

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Many ancient traditions
thought of the heart

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
as the primary seat
of consciousness,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.513 align:middle line:84%
the key to accessing
our inner wisdom.

00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:02.894 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:02.894 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
In many ancient cultures,
the heart was more primary.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It was viewed as the
seat of the soul.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.930 align:middle line:84%
The brain was viewed more like
a circuit board or processor.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't receive the
same amount of attention

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:90%
that we give it today.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
In some Eastern
cultures, there hasn't

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
been that same distinction
that we see in the West.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Heart and mind
are more the same.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And when saying, I
think, some cultures

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
point to their heart
rather than their head.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, our Western civilization
has moved so far away

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:90%
from our true self.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And part of our journey is
to come back to our center,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to once again
connect to our heart

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
as our center rather
than our brain.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.220 align:middle line:84%
We need to live from
the heart to think, act,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:90%
and speak from the heart.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, fortunately, we
live in exciting times

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
when science is beginning
to reveal evidence

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that supports what ancient
wisdom teachings have

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:90%
known all along.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at this
fascinating body of research

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that is reorienting us
back toward the heart

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:84%
as a key player in
the mind-body system.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Our journey to the heart
takes us deeper into the body,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:90%
into the center of our being.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
No longer do we think of
the heart as just a muscle

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that pumps blood
through our system.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're learning
the heart is more

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
similar to the brain than
any other organ in the body.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
Scientists discovered
in the '80s

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.780 align:middle line:84%
that the heart is made of a
huge number of glial cells

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and neurons much like the brain.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some scientists
think that it may even

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.620 align:middle line:84%
function semi-independently
as its own neural network.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
This has led some researchers
in the growing field

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
of neurocardiology to
propose the heart functions

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.400 align:middle line:90%
as another brain center.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And the heart's neural
circuitry gives it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.090 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
act independently,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to make decisions, and
to even feel and sense.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So what is the role of this
heart-brain connection?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
We find clues to how the
heart and brain communicate

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
through fascinating new
research on the vagus nerve.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's look more closely
at this important nerve.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The vagus nerve runs from the
top of the spinal cord down

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.420 align:middle line:90%
to all of the major organs.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's responsible for the
warm and expansive feelings

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
within our chest when we
feel moved by something.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:84%
It relates to our feelings of
altruism, romance, love, joy,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and other feel-good
qualities of the heart.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.290 align:middle line:84%
The magic ingredient involved
in all of these warm feelings

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
is a neuropeptide
called oxytocin.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin is called
the love chemical

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.040 align:middle line:84%
because our bodies produce
it in higher quantities when

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.760 align:middle line:84%
we're falling in love or
bonding with each other.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Oxytocin is produced both by the
hypothalamus gland in the brain

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.700 align:middle line:90%
as well as by the heart itself.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And the vagus nerve has an
abundance of receptor sites

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.790 align:middle line:90%
that oxytocin unlocks.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever known
someone who tends

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to be a really
big-hearted person, who

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.060 align:middle line:84%
seems to have a lot of
compassion, gratitude, love,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.330 align:middle line:90%
and joy to share with others?

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.460 align:middle line:84%
It's likely that
they are someone

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:84%
who generally has a
high level of activity

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:90%
in their vagus nerve.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
And children who are more
cooperative and likely to share

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
have also been found to have
more vagus nerve activity.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.790 align:middle line:84%
What else does the
vagus nerve do?

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, we've all heard of how
meditation and mindfulness

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
activities reduce stress
and improve our health.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Research on the vagus nerve
has revealed a key piece

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:90%
of how and why this happens.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:10%
It turns out that
the vagus nerve

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.940 align:middle line:10%
is the primary nerve controlling
our parasympathetic nervous

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:10%
system.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.870 align:middle line:84%
As we stimulate the vagus
nerve, our heart rate slows down

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.800 align:middle line:84%
and our relaxation
response kicks in.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
This stimulation produces
a neurotransmitter

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:84%
called acetylcholine, which
reduces inflammation and helps

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.395 align:middle line:90%
to activate our muscles.

00:05:48.395 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, why is this so important?

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Stress amplifies inflammation.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And inflammation accelerates
the breakdown of cells,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
the onset of disease,
and the aging process.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.260 align:middle line:84%
This is why when we're
chronically stressed

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.560 align:middle line:84%
we age more quickly
and get sick.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
By stimulating the
vagus nerve, we

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.570 align:middle line:84%
can reduce the
effects of stress.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So how do we stimulate
the vagus nerve?

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Through simple practices
like meditation,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:84%
qigong, chanting or humming,
slow, deep breathing

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:84%
into the belly, as well as long
hugs and positive connections

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.370 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.670 align:middle line:84%
This is why many
of these practices

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.970 align:middle line:84%
are promoted for anti-aging
and to reduce stress

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and inflammation
in the body as well

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:90%
as to boost our immune system.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies truly
have the potential

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.380 align:middle line:84%
to heal and repair themselves
beyond what we can imagine.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.080 align:middle line:84%
And the vagus nerve is
one of the key players

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:90%
in this process.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does this fit in with
the heart-and-brain connection?

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:84%
The brain and the heart
communicate primarily

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:90%
through the vagus nerve.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And for a long time,
biologists thought of the brain

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
as the command center that
directs the rest of the body,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:90%
including the heart.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
the flow of communication

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
isn't just one way.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Groundbreaking research
by the HeartMath Institute

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.630 align:middle line:84%
has shown the heart actually
sends more information

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to the brain than
the other way around.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And the heart actually
responds to emotional stimuli

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:90%
before the brain does.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Even more mind-blowing is that
the heart registers a response

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.400 align:middle line:84%
up to six seconds before
the stimulus is even

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:90%
presented to us.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, what does this mean?

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one, it shows
that the heart intuitively

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
knows what's coming just
before it appears, especially

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
when that stimulus might
trigger an emotional response

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.626 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, this puts a whole new
context on the old saying,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:90%
listen to your heart.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.580 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we
can draw from this

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.020 align:middle line:84%
is that the heart may be the
primary driver of the brain

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:90%
and not the other way around.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, spiritual
wisdom has taught this

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ages.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Again and again, the
teachings encourage

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:84%
us to shift out of the head
and connect into the heart.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.890 align:middle line:84%
We're guided to listen
within and receive

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of the heart
rather than grasping

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.010 align:middle line:90%
at it from the mind.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Why is this so important?

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.130 align:middle line:84%
We've seen, through our
exploration of the brain,

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
how our thought processes are
influenced by our subconscious

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Our mind is polluted by
indoctrination, past behavior

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
patterns, developmental
programming,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:90%
and unhealed traumas.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And this results in faulty
wiring that can lead us away

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:90%
from our true reality.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.180 align:middle line:84%
The heart, on the other hand,
connects us to our true self.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
It's our connection to the
signals coming from the deeper

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.540 align:middle line:84%
aspects of who we are,
including our higher

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.660 align:middle line:90%
self and our inner child.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
When we're trying to develop
ourselves on a spiritual path

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and we're coming into greater
connection to who we are,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the
heart is crucial.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:90%
We can't do it from the mind.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
If we are to become
more of our higher self

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.340 align:middle line:84%
and achieve our full
potential, then we

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:84%
must open this channel
of communication.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We must connect to
the heart, access

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.650 align:middle line:84%
this deep well of love,
compassion, forgiveness

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.500 align:middle line:90%
so that we can heal.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Too many people unfortunately
have closed down their heart

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:84%
chakras because of emotional
wounding around love, romance,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle line:84%
and not feeling good
enough or wanted.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.320 align:middle line:84%
But if we can come to
love and accept ourselves

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
regardless of how
others feel about us,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
then we can heal
from those wounds

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:90%
and keep our hearts open.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Only when our hearts are open
can we give and receive more

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:90%
love in our lives.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And we need to open our hearts
again so that they can function

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
at full capacity
to keep us healthy

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.030 align:middle line:90%
and living a life of joy.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Remember, our heart
is not just a pump.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a center of wisdom and
connection to true self.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So what do we know about
the heart as a brain center?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And what signals is it
sending to the brain?

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, the vagus nerve
is a closed circuit loop.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.980 align:middle line:84%
It runs from the brain to the
heart and then from the heart

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.800 align:middle line:90%
back to the brain.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And this allows the heart
to definitely influence

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:90%
the brain's action.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Even more fascinating
is the new evidence

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that the heart
sends more signals

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:84%
to the brain than
the other way around.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.500 align:middle line:84%
This is at least
true when it comes

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
to emotional and
intuitive content.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Plus, with the heart
producing its own peptides,

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitters, and
hormones, it has a direct effect

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:84%
on the emotional responses
of our limbic system

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.050 align:middle line:84%
as well as on our ability to
think with the upper cortex

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:90%
areas.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And these hormones also
influence the endocrine system,

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.830 align:middle line:84%
which is connected
to our chakras that

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:90%
interact with our biofield.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:84%
And we can take this even
further because the heart has

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:03.840 align:middle line:84%
a really strong
electromagnetic field that

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.840 align:middle line:90%
connects to our aura.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Studies by the HeartMath
Institute have shown that

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
the heart's magnetic field
is 60 times stronger than

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.960 align:middle line:90%
the brain's.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:10%
And it extends several
feet out from the body

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:10%
in every direction.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Every cell of our body
is also influenced

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
by this magnetic
field of the heart.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.950 align:middle line:10%
The more we look at the
heart, the more evidence

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:10%
we find that it's actually the
primary driver for the brain

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:10%
and our entire energy field.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
Another remarkable
aspect of the heart

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:90%
is its rhythm or heartbeat.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
This rhythm is
self-generated, meaning

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't rely on the brain.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:84%
The electrical impulses
that establish and control

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
this rhythm arise spontaneously
from within the cardiac cells

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
Equally intriguing is
that, after just a few days

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.490 align:middle line:84%
of the heart beginning to
beat, the inner ear also

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:90%
begins to form in the embryo.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And during these early
stages of development

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
the early brain
becomes entrained

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:90%
into the heart's rhythm.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
our own heartbeat,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
our mother's heartbeat is
the first resonance system

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%
that we are exposed to.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
As our own heartbeat
self-generates,

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
it first entrains into
the mother's heartbeat.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
A mother's heart beats at a
rate of about 75 to 80 beats

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.190 align:middle line:84%
per minute, which
equals about 1.25 hertz,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.200 align:middle line:90%
or beats per second.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.060 align:middle line:84%
The fetus's heartbeat increases
from there up to 185 beats

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:90%
per minute, or about 3 hertz.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So the heartbeat
of the fetus spans

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.130 align:middle line:90%
the range of 1 to 3 hertz.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the range that
coincides with delta brainwave

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And as the brain
starts to form, its

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.440 align:middle line:84%
synchronizes into
this delta rhythm.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not a conscious state--

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:90%
more like a deep trance.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And in this state,
though, we are

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:84%
connected to the oneness of
the vibrations coming in.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.720 align:middle line:90%
So what does this tell us?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, the heart is primary.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And the brain
development depends

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:90%
on this beating of the heart.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Both the fetus's and
the mother's heart

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
become the critical drivers for
synchronization and coherence.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:84%
The heart entrains the
brain through the heartbeat.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is why it can
be so powerful to tune

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:84%
in and listen to the
beating of your own heart.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.110 align:middle line:84%
What does this mean
for us here and now?

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, on this journey to
accessing our full potential,

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:84%
we need to shift from
being head-centered

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:90%
to heart-centered.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.196 align:middle line:84%
We want to let our heart
lead and conduct our flow.

00:15:16.196 --> 00:15:18.320 align:middle line:84%
And some ways to
start doing this

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
are to tune into the rhythm
of the heart, feel the pulse,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
tune into its beat, and
synchronize your breath

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.160 align:middle line:90%
with the heartbeat.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.340 align:middle line:84%
The breath will be
slower at a lower octave

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:84%
but in harmony
with the heartbeat.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
The more we bring our attention
to the rhythm of the heart,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:84%
the more our brain also starts
to train into that rhythm.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.870 align:middle line:84%
This will drop us into
a transcendent state

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness at the delta
brainwave frequency level.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And in such a state, our
sense of self disappears.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And we come into a more
pure state of awareness.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.470 align:middle line:84%
We transition from
our egoic self

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.980 align:middle line:90%
to pure awareness of being.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes a bridge,
moving our awareness

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:18.250 align:middle line:84%
beyond the body and coming
into a sense of expansiveness.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But how do we really know if
we are getting our brainwaves

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.731 align:middle line:90%
into sync with our heart?

00:16:26.731 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, today, we have
biofeedback methods

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:84%
that can assist us
with training ourselves

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle line:90%
into this coherent state.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.510 align:middle line:84%
The HeartMath
Institute has studied

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.120 align:middle line:84%
this brain-heart
coherence for many years

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
from the physiological,
emotional,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and psychospiritual
perspectives.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And by monitoring heart-rate
variability, respiratory rate,

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and brainwave signals, something
remarkable was revealed.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:84%
When a person successfully
entrains their heart,

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.220 align:middle line:84%
their breath, and their
brainwaves, there is a strong,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
0.1-hertz signal found traveling
throughout that heart-brain

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:90%
circuit of the vagus nerve.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:90%
Why is this so remarkable?

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:84%
Because if it was
just the heartbeat

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.020 align:middle line:84%
influencing the system,
then the signals

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.609 align:middle line:84%
would be more in the range of
1 to about 1 and 1/2 hertz.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So this 0.1-hertz signal is
pointing to something else.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
It points to a coherence of
several oscillating systems all

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.140 align:middle line:84%
interacting together to create
this 0.1-hertz variability

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:48.320 align:middle line:84%
signal and something new that
emerges from the interactions

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:90%
of several different parts.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And this signal actually
runs through the nerves

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and the sensory
receptors themselves

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.650 align:middle line:84%
connecting all of these
systems, bringing a higher

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:90%
level of order and coherence.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.130 align:middle line:84%
However, not all of the brain
can entrain into this narrow

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:90%
range of 0.1-hertz.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So in order to achieve a
total coherence of our system,

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
we need a broader
frequency range.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.550 align:middle line:90%
And how do we achieve that?

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It all comes down to a
certain kind of attitude--

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.530 align:middle line:84%
that is, to have an attitude
of gratitude and compassion.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Focusing on what we're grateful
for and being compassionate

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
influences our system
in powerful ways.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.010 align:middle line:84%
This really is about what
we choose to focus on.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:84%
It's about our
attitude towards life.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Are we in gratitude and focused
on what we're thankful for?

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Or are we focusing on
what's not to our liking

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:90%
and then complaining about it?

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Complaining create
stress in our system

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.610 align:middle line:84%
while gratitude brings us into
greater balance, coherence,

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.110 align:middle line:90%
and health.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Which would you rather have?

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:84%
But this also goes
way beyond just how

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.720 align:middle line:84%
we feel because
our attitude also

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.530 align:middle line:90%
influences our quantum reality.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:84%
We need to reach that
state of coherence

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
in order to have an influence
on the quantum field.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Without it, we won't
have any impact.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Our energies would be more
constantly fluctuating, almost

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
like an interrupted radio
signal full of static,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
and then sending out a
chaotic stream of energy.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:84%
That's not going to
influence the quantum field.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But when we come into
a coherent state,

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
it's as if our whole system
is working together as one.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Now, we can make impact.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.640 align:middle line:84%
In the law of attraction
and setting of intentions,

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
these things only work if
we're in a coherent state.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.650 align:middle line:84%
If we can't hold our
focus long enough,

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.530 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to access
the quantum field.

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Our attention needs
to be laser-focused.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
meditation is so key.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
With meditation, we
can train ourselves

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
to maintain a coherent
state and impact the field.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And while meditation helps us
sustain our coherent state,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:84%
attitude is a major factor in
getting us into that coherence.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.600 align:middle line:84%
Focusing on gratitude,
compassion, love--

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
these things will help us
bring our full attention

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
into the heart and into
these energies to get us

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.230 align:middle line:90%
into that coherent state.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
This is something
that is self-induced.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.340 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't require anything
from outside of us.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a choice we make
to create this within.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So how do we achieve
such a state?

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:84%
The key is that we need
to be it to attract it.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.390 align:middle line:84%
At the spiritual level,
the rule of thumb

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:90%
is, like attracts like.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So we want to attune to
love, compassion, empathy,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.390 align:middle line:90%
and romance--

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:84%
not from drama, but from a state
of being that is within us.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:32.890 align:middle line:84%
And it begins from us loving
ourselves, being compassionate

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.700 align:middle line:84%
towards ourselves, and
living a romantic life,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:90%
meaning a sensory-rich life.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what makes
us feel more fully alive.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Then, the hermetic principle
of correspondence kicks in--

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
as above, so below; as
the inner, so the outer.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And we attract more of
the same into our lives.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
As we come into
this coherent state,

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.620 align:middle line:84%
we shift our awareness
from the brain down

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:90%
to the heart consciousness.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the feelings of gratitude,
love, and compassion

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
continue to deepen
and expand within us.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.240 align:middle line:84%
This becomes the bridge
to transcendent states

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.450 align:middle line:84%
where we achieve full
spectrum synchronization

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:24.600 align:middle line:90%
of our brain, heart, and body.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, what happens when we come
into this fully synchronized

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:90%
state?

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Studies with experienced
Tibetan monks

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:36.570 align:middle line:90%
reveal some fascinating answers.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Scientists monitored the
brainwaves of the monks

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.110 align:middle line:84%
during a deep
meditation process.

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:84%
As they went into
their meditation,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:84%
their brainwaves shifted
from beta to alpha to theta

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and, finally, into
delta as expected.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.570 align:middle line:84%
As the monks reached
that deep state of delta,

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.380 align:middle line:84%
they report tapping
into a sense of oneness

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.780 align:middle line:84%
with the universal
consciousness.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It is here that they
began to then focus

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
on gratitude and compassion,
bringing their whole being

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:90%
into this state.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Then, their focus moved
towards sending this compassion

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude out into the world
for the benefit of all beings.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:84%
The remarkable discovery
was that, as they

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.500 align:middle line:84%
start to send this
energy out, it

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:84%
triggers gamma waves from the
deep parts of the brain up.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And as gamma sweeps through the
whole brain and harmonizes it,

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.370 align:middle line:84%
this then brings them into
a full-spectrum entrainment

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:90%
spanning from delta to gamma.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Even more remarkable is that
the gamma signals observed

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.780 align:middle line:84%
in these monks were the largest
ever seen in any humans.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And during waking
consciousness, they still

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:84%
hold that vibration of
compassion and gratitude.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
When we're in the presence
of one of these monks,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
we can often sense that
reverence, that peace,

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:14.420 align:middle line:84%
holiness, that beauty, and
the compassion in their field.

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:19.210 align:middle line:84%
This is something we can all
cultivate through a dedicated

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.420 align:middle line:90%
meditation practice.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we access
this peak state,

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.810 align:middle line:84%
we're connected to
universal consciousness.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And we tune into pure joy,
compassion, and wisdom.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.300 align:middle line:84%
It's an enlightened
state of being.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Speaking of enlightenment,
what is it anyhow?

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Many people think
that enlightenment

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:90%
is a destination, an end goal.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:90%
But in truth, it's a beginning.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
It's an awakening to these
higher states of consciousness

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and starting to experience
new states of being

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:90%
that expand our perspective.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.200 align:middle line:84%
When we reach this
awakening, we begin

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:84%
to truly step onto
the path to attaining

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:08.500 align:middle line:90%
our own spiritual mastery.

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Enlightened people don't
always feel bliss, joy,

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:90%
and compassion.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment doesn't take
people's problems away.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Usually, when we awaken
to enlightenment,

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.920 align:middle line:84%
we actually feel
everything more deeply.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
We become truly in touch
with our soul and spirit.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And in this great
empathy, we may even

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:37.360 align:middle line:84%
feel more pain, the pain of the
world that we're connected to.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Achieving true mastery of the
heart moves us towards this.

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a gateway to this
enlightenment type of state

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
to live with greater compassion,
empathy, devotion, and desire

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.230 align:middle line:90%
to serve.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.270 align:middle line:84%
How do we hold these energies
of compassion and love

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:00.970 align:middle line:90%
within our energy field?

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.030 align:middle line:84%
What's happening in
our biofield that

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:08.700 align:middle line:84%
supports the transfer of
this energy to others?

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.980 align:middle line:84%
To answer this, let's
take a quick look

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.550 align:middle line:84%
at the heart's influence
on the biofield.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
When the heart
beats, it generates

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic field with
the strength of 2 and 1/2 watts

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.240 align:middle line:90%
of energy in every pulse.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
We can measure this field
up to at least 3 feet,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.360 align:middle line:90%
or 1 meter from the body.

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.900 align:middle line:84%
But aura carries this
energy even further

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.590 align:middle line:84%
reaching out to as far
as 50 feet from the body.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
If we look at our
aura as a torus,

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.200 align:middle line:90%
the heart is at the center.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And it pumps energies
through our field.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And this pumping amplifies
the electromagnetic effect.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:10%
As it pumps, that energy moves
through the toroidal flow.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.940 align:middle line:10%
And in the heart's center
is a spiraling vortex.

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.470 align:middle line:90%
The brain emits a field too.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:90%
But it's much smaller.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And when the biofield of
the brain and the heart

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:13.050 align:middle line:84%
are entrained together however,
the impact is much greater.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:16.290 align:middle line:84%
When we reach a coherent
state, that frequency

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
travels throughout the brain,
the body, and the aura.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And not only are we
creating coherence

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:90%
in our inner structures.

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:84%
We're affecting our
biofield as well.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.830 align:middle line:84%
Plus, then, when others
enter into our biofield,

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:middle line:84%
they can be entrained into
the frequencies that we emit.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.030 align:middle line:84%
The greater our
state of coherence,

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:46.050 align:middle line:84%
the stronger our resonance
is to entrain others

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.520 align:middle line:90%
into that vibration.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Where does this gateway
of the heart take us?

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Mystics have often talked
about that intelligence

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.440 align:middle line:84%
of the heart which guides us
towards kindness, altruism,

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
and caring for the
well-being of all.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:84%
This intelligence is
not logical though.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.020 align:middle line:90%
It's based on compassion.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And it connects us
with the greater whole.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The heart guides us
towards kindness.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a gateway
through which we connect

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.980 align:middle line:90%
to the whole of the universe.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.460 align:middle line:84%
From a quantum
perspective, there

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.940 align:middle line:84%
is a vast amount of energy
stored within this frequency

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:90%
spectrum.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And through the
gateway of the heart,

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
we can connect to the
holographic unity.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We bridge the individual
self with the greater cosmos.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:90%
We maintain our sense of self.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:90%
But it's no longer a barrier.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.960 align:middle line:90%
We don't sense any separation.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And we connect to the
whole of the universe.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:54.890 align:middle line:84%
What are some steps
that we can take

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to open this
gateway of the heart

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and cultivate more compassion,
gratitude, and love?

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not we can access
these energies ultimately

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:11.490 align:middle line:84%
rests upon our own attitudes
of ourselves and our lives.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:84%
When someone sees
themselves as a victim,

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:19.140 align:middle line:84%
it's because they've taken on
an outlook of separateness.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling of powerlessness
where things are outside

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:90%
seem more powerful.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.320 align:middle line:84%
When we feel powerless,
we then don't

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
feel good enough or worthy
enough to deal with things.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's our sense of
self-worth, self-love,

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:40.260 align:middle line:84%
and self-acceptance that rests
at the core of our ability

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to access this
gateway of the heart.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, this comes
down to two questions.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Can we love ourselves enough?

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And can we be
grateful for our lives

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:57.360 align:middle line:84%
even if we don't think there's
much to be grateful about?

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.020 align:middle line:84%
In one study, participants
kept a gratitude journal

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:90%
for six weeks.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.290 align:middle line:84%
And then three
months later, they

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:84%
were given an exercise
to express gratitude.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
Those who practiced the
gratitude journaling

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.590 align:middle line:84%
showed significantly
more activity

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.830 align:middle line:84%
in the medial
prefrontal cortex when

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:84%
compared to the control group
who didn't do the journaling.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.510 align:middle line:84%
This was three months after
their gratitude journaling

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.850 align:middle line:90%
had ended.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet the brain had
sustainably changed.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that
practicing gratitude

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.830 align:middle line:84%
can help train our
brain to be more

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:39.900 align:middle line:84%
sensitive to the experience
of gratitude long range.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It rewires our brain
and our outlook on life.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Practicing gratitude,
even if we don't feel it,

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:53.310 align:middle line:84%
creates a shift within us to
start experiencing it more.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:54.840 align:middle line:10%
One way to start
working with this

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.060 align:middle line:10%
is to start your own
gratitude journal

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.430 align:middle line:10%
and make it a daily practice.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Just by committing to
the journaling practice,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.830 align:middle line:84%
you might start
looking for the things

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful for as
you go through your day.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.440 align:middle line:84%
This then starts
shifting your perspective

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.880 align:middle line:84%
on what we're
paying attention to

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.140 align:middle line:84%
or focusing on
throughout the day.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.840 align:middle line:84%
When you find something
to be grateful for,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.500 align:middle line:84%
connect to the heart
in that moment.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Tune in and be fully present
with that moment of gratitude.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Even putting a hand
on her heart can

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:35.030 align:middle line:84%
help us shift our focus
and body awareness.

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Rather than feeling it for
a second and then moving on,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.360 align:middle line:90%
stay in that moment.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Be there in that moment
of time and learn

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to amplify that
feeling of gratitude.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:52.710 align:middle line:84%
As we tune in and take time
to experience gratitude,

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:56.600 align:middle line:84%
this also encourages
more oxytocin production.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:10%
And doing this will help us
come into a coherent state.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And as we amplify
the experience,

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.786 align:middle line:90%
we prolong that state.

00:32:06.786 --> 00:32:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we
can do throughout the day

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.770 align:middle line:84%
as we experienced
moments of gratitude

00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and again in the evening
when we journal it down.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.060 align:middle line:84%
As you do this, focus
on the heart center.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Focus on gratitude,
love, acceptance.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.300 align:middle line:90%
And also, acknowledge yourself.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.370 align:middle line:84%
This is about loving yourself
and accepting yourself.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are three areas to
focus on with this practice.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The first is to
include five things

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.080 align:middle line:90%
that you're grateful for today.

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.510 align:middle line:84%
These can be things that you're
grateful for in your life

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:46.730 align:middle line:84%
in general or things you
experienced this day.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:51.980 align:middle line:84%
The second is to acknowledge
five things about yourself

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:90%
and what you've accomplished.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.620 align:middle line:84%
If you've handled a stressful
situation with equanimity

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.280 align:middle line:84%
or did something to be
proud of, acknowledge it.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:05.720 align:middle line:84%
This is about shifting to focus
on gratitude and love of self

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.360 align:middle line:84%
rather than on all the
ways that we cut ourselves

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:90%
down and criticize.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.370 align:middle line:90%
Let's affirm what we did well.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
The third area to
journal about is

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:20.210 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge five things to
be grateful for in the world

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:23.960 align:middle line:84%
or the universe or with our
connection to divine source,

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.600 align:middle line:90%
something that is beyond us.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.690 align:middle line:84%
For example, we can
acknowledge our gratitude

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:84%
towards the majesty
of eternal spirit

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.670 align:middle line:84%
or towards the
beauty of the world.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledge the opportunities
and the freedoms

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have to explore these
things in today's world.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Find things at a
philosophical level

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.070 align:middle line:84%
that we can be grateful
for and connect

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:90%
to the unity of all things.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And when you find
yourself moving out

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.620 align:middle line:84%
of coherence or start
feeling stressed,

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:02.370 align:middle line:84%
you can also practice
controlled breathing.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The breath is one
of the fastest ways

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:90%
to influence our nervous system.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.489 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the breath as it
comes in through the nose,

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:15.690 align:middle line:84%
travels down the throat, and
then bring it down to the heart

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:90%
and even to the belly.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.139 align:middle line:84%
We want to really
slow down our breath

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.980 align:middle line:84%
to five to seven
breaths per minute

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.980 align:middle line:84%
in order to stimulate
that vagus nerve.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:33.300 align:middle line:84%
We can achieve this by
breathing into a count of five,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.730 align:middle line:84%
hold the breath for
a count of five,

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.980 align:middle line:84%
and then exhale
to a count of 10.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.620 align:middle line:90%


00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:84%
Breathing out through
the mouth helps

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.989 align:middle line:90%
to release more of the stress.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:49.300 align:middle line:84%
As you breathe,
bring your attention

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:54.760 align:middle line:84%
to drawing that breath down into
the heart and into the belly.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the breath
drawing in energy

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
to activate the vagus nerve
traveling from the low brain

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.510 align:middle line:84%
to all of the organs
and the heart.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Close your eyes and pull this
breath in through the nose

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.380 align:middle line:90%
as it goes down.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.750 align:middle line:84%
It goes through the lower
regions of the brain

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.640 align:middle line:90%
into the spinal column.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And this activates the
vagus nerve and the heart.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.690 align:middle line:90%


00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we take our
final step on this journey

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:84%
into the deepest
parts of our being

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:32.210 align:middle line:84%
that connect us with the
universal consciousness.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:84%
of our human potential with
me in this episode of "Mystery

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Teachings."
