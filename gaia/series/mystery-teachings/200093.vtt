00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:10%
How do we reclaim the
feminine aspect of the divine

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.470 align:middle line:10%
and bring ourselves into
greater balance and wholeness?

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:10%
Most Western religions look
to God as a male figure,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.030 align:middle line:10%
and within these patriarchal
traditions around the world,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:10%
the feminine aspect has been
either ignored, diminished,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.490 align:middle line:10%
or obscured.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.470 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, both
men and women today

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
are really feeling
this missing component

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.170 align:middle line:84%
of the divine feminine,
and we see the imbalance

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:84%
that it has created
in our world.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
How do we establish a
more harmonious balance,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.976 align:middle line:84%
one that equally honors
both masculine and feminine?

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalistic teachings
begin with the source,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.340 align:middle line:90%
or what we call the Ein Sof.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Ein Sof means limitless.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
It's that alternate source
that is undifferentiated.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no he or she or they.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.200 align:middle line:84%
It's divine intelligence,
and yet everything

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.840 align:middle line:84%
we could say about Ein Sof, we
could say the opposite as well.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof is a great mystery
in the Kabbalistic tradition.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond definition, and Ein
Sof's home is the multiverse.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
So we're not even talking
about just our universe here.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
From the mystery
school teachings,

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof was there
before the beginning,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.500 align:middle line:84%
floating above some sort of
darkness or prima materia.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Today, we might call this the
quantum sea if potentiality,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and everything that's
possible is there.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
All of it already exists
but in a dormant state,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:84%
as if it were
asleep and unaware.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are multiple
versions of this story of how

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof began to
create the universe,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:84%
and each version reveals
a different aspect

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:90%
of the mystery teachings.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They're all true in
an archetypal sense,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.020 align:middle line:84%
but there are slight
differences that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
get highlighted within this
multi-dimensional experience.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, in one version, Ein Sof
is neither male nor female,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.130 align:middle line:90%
and yet Ein Sof is both.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And by will alone, Ein
Sof sends out a single ray

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to scan all of the
potentials that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.100 align:middle line:84%
were there in the darkness
of the multiverse.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And this ray gets
sent out, and it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:84%
happens to be the feminine
aspect of Ein Sof.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, why would a feminine
ray be sent out first?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, because Ein Sof wanted
to scan with total acceptance

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and non-intrusive energy first.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not trying to
overcome or impose.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just sensing,
scanning, and feeling

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.080 align:middle line:84%
from a slightly passive
or receptive state,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and the essence of this first
ray was primordial love.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.090 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, we call this
first ray the feminine aspect

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:90%
of Ein Sof, or the Shekinah.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
The name Shekinah means
the indwelling presence,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and yet Shekinah is a divine
being in her own right.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.930 align:middle line:84%
She's a goddess-- perfect and
complete in and of herself.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, it makes sense that
Ein Sof would send out

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860 align:middle line:84%
the passive energy first,
just to scan, feel,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:90%
and explore what's there.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not intrusive or assertive.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.950 align:middle line:84%
It's just sensing, and
that's the key point.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the act Ein Sof
sending out this first ray

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is actually a masculine act,
and yet the essence of the ray

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle line:90%
is feminine.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:84%
So right here, in this
very first moment,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof essentially
distinguishes itself

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
into masculine and
feminine aspects.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Let's back up for a moment.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.682 align:middle line:84%
Why did Ein Sof send out the
ray of light in the first place?

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we ask this
question, the only answer

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
we can come up with is Ein Sof
wanted to see and experience

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:90%
the potentials.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The first energy
to create movement

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.529 align:middle line:84%
is a spark of pure
desire and passion

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:90%
to experience something.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:90%
The second question is how?

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.940 align:middle line:84%
How did Ein Sof send
out this first ray?

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, scientists today still
don't know what happened right

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.200 align:middle line:90%
before the Big Bang.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Those moments leading up to
that initiation of the Big Bang

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.730 align:middle line:84%
are a mystery, and this is
where mystics must come in.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
They can access a
transcendent state

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.640 align:middle line:84%
to receive a vision of what
initiated this process, how

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:90%
it all started.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
One such mystic was Isaac Luria,
a Kabbalist from the 1500s.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:84%
What Luria saw in his vision
was that Ein Sof was everywhere

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and nowhere, an infinite
being, a limitless source,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and there is no place
that Ein Sof is not.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So for the potentials to come
into being, to be actualized,

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Ein Sof had to create space.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that,
because Ein Sof is limitless,

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof therefore had to
contract, or withdraw.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.360 align:middle line:84%
This contraction was
an outward movement.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
It was a withdrawal
from a center point,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and this created a
tiny vacuum, as well as

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:90%
a point of reference.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, this withdrawal away
from this tiny space,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.070 align:middle line:84%
this active
constriction, required

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.030 align:middle line:84%
quite a bit of will,
discipline, and self-sacrifice,

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
all driven by a desire to
experience and to express.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, inside the
vacuum, the space

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.470 align:middle line:84%
was emptied of Ein Sof's being,
but the memory of Ein Sof

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
still remained, like how the
smell of a cologne or perfume

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.350 align:middle line:84%
remains even after
the wearer has left.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The essence of that presence
was called Shekinah.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.520 align:middle line:84%
She is the divine presence
that dwells within the space,

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:90%
or the form, that was created.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, because the energy of the
Ein Sofic source is infinite,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:84%
there is nowhere
it could not be.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So in the next instant
after creating the vacuum,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that source energy was drawn
down into it to fill it.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
As the energy came pouring
in to fill the vessel,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.170 align:middle line:84%
this is the equivalent to the
masculine essence impregnating

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:90%
the feminine vessel.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
And this union created
an infinitesimally small,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.770 align:middle line:84%
yet infinitely dense,
singularity point.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:84%
That singularity,
or point of unity,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
is Keter, the very crown
of the Tree of Life.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It's also the spark that
initiates the Big Bang.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is another
version of this story that

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:90%
has a more mythic flair to it.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Here's how it goes.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.620 align:middle line:84%
As Shekinah was out scanning
the potentials in the darkness,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%
she feels something is missing.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Not that something's
missing within her,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.310 align:middle line:84%
for she is complete
within herself.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So Shekinah calls out to Ein Sof
and says, something's missing,

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and Ein Sof calls back saying,
maybe you're feeling lonely.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
These potentials that she was
sensing could be actualized,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:90%
but they're not.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.560 align:middle line:84%
They're dormant,
and then Ein Sof

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:84%
asks her, what are you
going to do about it?

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.240 align:middle line:84%
What's she going to do,
not I know what you need,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:90%
here let me fix it for you.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof puts it back on her, on
Shekinah, to decide what to do.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And because she's
the goddess, so she's

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:84%
the one who can birth
things into being,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.610 align:middle line:90%
so what does she do?

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, the story says,
she summons desire.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's this desire energy again.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Shekinah summons desire
and fills herself with it,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and then sends it out
into the darkness.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.710 align:middle line:84%
That desire energy is
a fire that goes out

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness, and
it awakens and draws

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:84%
to her the perfect
masculine counterpart.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:10%
The masculine counterpart comes
to her, and as they unite,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.990 align:middle line:10%
it's said that they
melded together.

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:10%
First, their fingertips touched.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Then, their hands,
then their third eyes,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.740 align:middle line:84%
and as they embraced,
they became one being.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.299 align:middle line:84%
As they merge, their heads open
up like a 1,000 petal lotus,

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and from it, out come all
the stars and the souls

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and everything that was
created into the universe.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And it all started
with the desire

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:84%
of a woman, the
Creatrix, but the desire

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.190 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
here is one of purity.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Shekinah didn't
have a list of who

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
or what she wanted
this counterpart to be.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.140 align:middle line:84%
She simply called
in whatever energy

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.450 align:middle line:84%
was needed to fulfill her desire
and bring creation into being.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:90%
In other words, she trusted.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:84%
She simply summoned and
then flowed that energy out.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And as her divine mate
came together with her,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and their heads opened up,
all of the seeds of light

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
came out to impregnate
and seed the universe.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And from this came
all the stars,

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
the planets, the spirits that
would inhabit the universe.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, this story that
I've just shared here

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.280 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to that
of Shakti and Shiva

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:84%
from the Vedas and also the yin
and yang principles of the Dao.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But the mystical
vision of Isaac Luria

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
gives us more to
this picture that

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
can be related to the
science of the Big Bang.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's return to the
Lurionic version of this story.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
What Luria saw was that,
as the light was drawn down

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:84%
into the empty vessel, into
this infinitely small point,

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.860 align:middle line:84%
the vessel became so full
of this potent energy

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.096 align:middle line:90%
that it over filled.

00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, rather than the romantic
story of two lovers merging

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:84%
and their heads opening up
like this 1,000 petal lotus,

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
in this version of the
story, the vessel exploded.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.800 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't contain
any more, and this

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
is where we cross into now the
modern cosmology of the Big

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
The sparks and light and energy
flowing out from this explosion

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:90%
brings this universe into being.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
That explosion
shattered the vessel

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:90%
and also shattered the unity.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, in science today, they
call this the first symmetry

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.630 align:middle line:10%
breaking, and that led
to the first divergence

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.120 align:middle line:10%
from the Grand Unified field.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.450 align:middle line:84%
We had unity, but it
was too intense to bring

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
physical density
into manifestation.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So it shattered, and the
sparks and the seeds of light

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.900 align:middle line:84%
flow out in all
directions, but order then

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.290 align:middle line:84%
needed to be re-established,
and hence the laws of physics

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:90%
came in to help bring order.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the story goes that there
were multiple shatterings,

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:84%
and in Season 1,
Episode 3, we talked

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
about the sequence of the
Big Bang and these symmetry

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.320 align:middle line:90%
breakings.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.750 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, these
multiple shatterings,

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.530 align:middle line:84%
or symmetry breakings, were
needed to get to the point

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.510 align:middle line:84%
where physical life could
form in the universe.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, what can we learn
from these stories?

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalah teaches us
several really important things

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:84%
that we can come to understand
from these stories of creation.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
First, let's talk about
that initiating principal

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:90%
of creation, that desire energy.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, they call
it Ein Sof's Ratzon

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.000 align:middle line:90%
which means a depth of good.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:84%
This desire comes from a
deep place of goodness,

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and it's the essential
quality of the divine source

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.110 align:middle line:90%
as a creator.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a pure desire to impart
or to give selflessly,

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.150 align:middle line:84%
to express and reveal
the divine self,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.480 align:middle line:84%
and give of the divine
self to creation.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:84%
This is the kind of desire
we're talking about here.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a pure desire,
not from ego, not

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
from what we think of as
humans, but a potent energy that

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
initiates this whole
process, and it's also

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.950 align:middle line:90%
something we can tap into.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the original
contraction,

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
to create the void,
or the vessel,

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof created the
desire to receive as well.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.690 align:middle line:84%
That desire to
receive is feminine,

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
and the desire to
give is masculine.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And these two things were
created at the same time

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:90%
in that original contraction.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Only with the desire to
receive can the desire

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:90%
to give be fulfilled.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:84%
The giver must have a receiver,
otherwise, it can't give.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
The splitting into the
masculine and feminine energies

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:16.120 align:middle line:84%
completed the picture and
allowed for creation to happen.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
How can we apply
this to our lives?

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we really want to
create something powerful,

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
we need to tap into
that same energy.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
What we see in the
story of Shekinah

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the potentials
are already there.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:90%
They're just not aware.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.020 align:middle line:90%
They're dormant, or asleep.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.920 align:middle line:84%
So sending out the rays
to turn on the lights

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
serves the purpose of
bringing awareness,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and with awareness,
the potentials

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
can become actualized in
their own purpose and form.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
there in potential,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's awakened by
this process of Shekinah

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and her mate coming together.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a conception
and birthing process

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:84%
to turn on the potentials
and give them life.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:84%
Right here is a big
key to tap into.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Our desire has to come
from a pure place.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:84%
We need to tap into our
energy of passion and desire

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:90%
to give life.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not coming from any
kind of egoic greed or lust

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.420 align:middle line:84%
but from a pure desire
to express, to give,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:90%
and to awaken.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously,
our counterpart

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
is receiving that,
giving and receiving

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:38.265 align:middle line:84%
from a pure place of expressing
and awakening divinity.

00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we get
to that pure place?

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, we have to get
into a state of pure mind,

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
to tap into the
higher mind, rising

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
above our egos,
attachments, and opinions.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:84%
It's pure expression that moves
through us, and in this state,

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.890 align:middle line:90%
there's no human thinking.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But we do have an intent,
and we direct desire

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
toward that intent, making sure
we're coming from a pure mind

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.010 align:middle line:90%
and that our intent is good.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, what do we mean by good?

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, the will to
do good is one that

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:84%
leads towards the
progression of life

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and towards its highest
purpose and form.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.420 align:middle line:84%
What's good is what
aids progression

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
to the full awakening
of divinity,

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.210 align:middle line:84%
and our intent must be aligned
with that place of goodness

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Also, keep in mind,
there's no attachment here.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Shekinah wasn't trying to
control what was being created,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and neither did Ein Sof.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:90%
They weren't creating a list.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:84%
They were sensing a potential
of what was already there

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and sending out the light
with a desire for awakening.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:84%
There was no attachment
to the outcome either.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
When we remain non-attached,
then there's no fear.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's coming from
a place of wholeness

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
with a pure desire to
express, rather than

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:84%
from a place of lack
or fear or attachment.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
These are things we can identify
within ourselves, when it

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:90%
comes to our creation process.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, another key
these stories reveal

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
speaks to a larger process of
healing and progression for us

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.210 align:middle line:90%
as humans.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go back to the
concept of that shattering

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:90%
of the vessels.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:84%
We've mentioned how it
coincides with the symmetry

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:84%
breaking of the
Big Bang cosmology,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.310 align:middle line:84%
but at a very
archetypal level, we

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:84%
can see the shattering
in many planes.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
It happens in our
own lives as well.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.090 align:middle line:84%
We've all experienced
shattering moments in life--

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.770 align:middle line:84%
traumas, shock, unexpected
tragedies or events.

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
Even concepts can
shatter us sometimes

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.025 align:middle line:84%
by challenging our
notion of what's real,

00:16:54.025 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and these shatterings leave
us feeling like we're broken,

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.370 align:middle line:84%
or we have to pick
up the pieces again.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
It may be an
emotional, a physical,

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.800 align:middle line:84%
or mental shattering experience,
and in those moments,

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:90%
they feel very painful.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And our natural
urge is to resist it

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
or to think that
we're being attacked.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
The ego comes in, and it
thinks it's being assaulted.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And so it goes into
this defense mode,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.839 align:middle line:84%
and we may feel like a
victim of circumstance.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy to stay
stuck in that victim mindset,

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
if we're attached to what's
being taken away or done to us.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:84%
Attachment to the old form,
which is our comfort zone,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:90%
it's familiar.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.810 align:middle line:84%
It's what we knew and how
we think things should be,

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.770 align:middle line:84%
but that attachment to the
old form is also limiting us.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It's limiting our
ability to experience

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:90%
the fullness of our potential.

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at
it in another way,

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:84%
there's a natural
archetypal theme

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.560 align:middle line:84%
within the universe
that requires

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.600 align:middle line:90%
these shattering moments.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
These moments act as catalysts
for our growth and progression.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Just like in alchemy, we
start with calcination,

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.550 align:middle line:84%
or the burning which
destroys the old form.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:84%
There's a natural
alchemy to the flow

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.820 align:middle line:84%
of the universe that's required
for things to progress.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And the shattering is
required for Ein Sof

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to express those potentials
and send the light out

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
into the darkness, to push the
envelope of the actualization

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:90%
of the light.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:29.030 align:middle line:84%
This alchemy is always going
to be at work in our lives.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to hit
moments of shattering.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
It goes all the way
to the creational act

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.430 align:middle line:84%
on a spiritual level,
as well as the Big Bang,

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.520 align:middle line:90%
and in our own life experiences.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:84%
The process of
giving birth is also

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.750 align:middle line:84%
a shattering experience
for the mother

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.232 align:middle line:84%
and the baby and the
father, if he witnesses it.

00:18:49.232 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But instead of getting hung up
on these shattering moments,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:90%
realize that they are catalysts.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Something new is
trying to be born.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Something new is being
pushed into being created,

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.030 align:middle line:90%
and there's a need to expand.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.920 align:middle line:84%
We can ask questions like,
what do I need to learn here?

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.230 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to heal?

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And now that everything's in
shambles, which pieces must we

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:84%
pull back together to
create a new vessel with?

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to create
a new container that's

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
better than the old one
and can hold more energy.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
This is the alchemical
process, and in Kabbalah, we

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:90%
call this tikkun.

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a rectification, healing,
a repair of the vessels

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:90%
that have been shattered.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
That process of going
through the healing of tikkun

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.430 align:middle line:84%
is an alchemical
process that ultimately

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
raises our vibration,
piece by piece,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:90%
back up to our wholeness.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Our wholeness is always there,
but we've disconnected from it

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:90%
through the shatterings.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, we reclaim and bring it
into a complete vessel again.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.680 align:middle line:84%
We go through this
process, cycle after cycle,

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and come into greater
levels of our wholeness,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.160 align:middle line:84%
or what Carl Jung called
our individuation.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
By going through this
process, we come to a place

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
where we can contain more the
fullness of our original vessel

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:90%
and purpose.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have to be ready
to receive and have the desire

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:90%
to receive within us.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.170 align:middle line:84%
Often, we think we want
something in our life,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:84%
but there is a part of us
that doesn't actually want it.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.470 align:middle line:84%
We think, yeah, I want
to fulfill my greater

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.630 align:middle line:84%
potential and purpose,
but at the same time,

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.080 align:middle line:84%
this means more responsibility
and more ownership

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.610 align:middle line:90%
for our lives.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.390 align:middle line:84%
And it means taking on more and
moving out of the comfort zone.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are many things
that the ego resists, when we

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.435 align:middle line:90%
stretch ourselves in such ways.

00:20:47.435 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So in the process of tikkun, we
must dig into our subconscious

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:90%
and let go of attachments.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
We must clear, heal, and
resolve to bring ourselves

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:03.170 align:middle line:84%
into a true readiness to
receive our higher light.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah says that
this healing journey

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
is essential for our own
personal progression, as well

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.190 align:middle line:90%
as that of the whole world.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It's necessary to be ready
to receive and create

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:17.420 align:middle line:84%
the life we're here to live,
to manifest the full potential

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.630 align:middle line:90%
of the goodness within us.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Not only is this
important for us

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:84%
as individuals and our
world, but it's also

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:90%
essential on a cosmic scale.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:84%
We humans are on a
journey to be part

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.870 align:middle line:84%
of repairing the vessels
of the universe as a whole.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the shattering of the
original vessel of Shekinah,

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
it's said that the
shards of her vessel

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
flew out into the different
parts of the universe.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And these became the souls,
the planets, and the stars,

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
and this includes us,
our souls are fragments

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:90%
of her great soul, or vessel.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.820 align:middle line:90%
Shekinah is here with us.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.980 align:middle line:84%
She is the indwelling
presence of the divine within.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The masculine
aspect of the divine

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
is more transcendent in the
higher spiritual realms.

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.680 align:middle line:84%
While the feminine aspect
is embodied within us,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.140 align:middle line:90%
within this physical form.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Shekinah is here
within each of us.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The divine is within,
and yet, we're each

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:90%
a fragment of the divine whole.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And in order to bring that
wholeness back together,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.930 align:middle line:84%
to restore the
oneness, the unity,

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.230 align:middle line:84%
we need to go through
tikkun, both individually

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:90%
and collectively.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalah says that this
is the most important purpose

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:90%
of our existence.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the great
work before us.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Originally, the
vessel shattered,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
because it couldn't
contain the oneness,

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.510 align:middle line:84%
and in order to get there, it
had to go through the alchemy.

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
It goes from a fragile state
into a more integral state.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the true
Philosopher's Stone

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that can't be
destroyed, no matter

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:04.830 align:middle line:84%
the amount of power or
light flowing into it.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us
to our own process

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.520 align:middle line:84%
of stepping into service, to
help others on their healing

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
journey, because we're all one.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And when we get to that
level of awareness and awaken

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:84%
to this oneness, we start to
see how we're all connected.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So as we've talked about
in this and other episodes,

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.860 align:middle line:84%
we're in this
process of ascension,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and we're poised to
make a collective shift.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.830 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalah says that this
is the most important thing

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
to devote ourselves
to, and yet, we

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:84%
get so caught up in
the world and all

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.400 align:middle line:90%
of its drama and politics.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And it distracts us from the
inner work and the service

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:90%
that we're meant to be doing.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's important to be
engaged in the outer world too.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:52.230 align:middle line:84%
It's a manifestation of our
mind, our efforts, and actions,

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and we can look to
the manifestations

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.190 align:middle line:84%
we see in the outer world
as reflections or feedback

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:90%
about what we need to repair.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But when we apply this to
our topic of the masculine

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
and the feminine
aspects of creation,

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.300 align:middle line:84%
the outward focus is more
of a masculine approach.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.000 align:middle line:84%
This includes the action
in the world focused

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
on production, results, and
tangible efforts of our hands.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the modern world today,
especially in the last 100

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
years, we've grown more
focused on the outer world

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.190 align:middle line:84%
at the expense of
our inner world which

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:90%
is more of our feminine side.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, we
see this imbalance

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
of masculine and
feminine in our world.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.820 align:middle line:84%
We're also seeing an
effort to restore balance,

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:39.280 align:middle line:84%
but unfortunately,
it's become corrupted

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.190 align:middle line:84%
by confusion of what
really is masculine,

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.100 align:middle line:90%
and what is feminine?

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.530 align:middle line:84%
We need to re-establish
balance as part

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:52.320 align:middle line:84%
of the process of tikkun, and
for that, we need clarity.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:84%
When we look out
at the world, we

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:58.500 align:middle line:84%
might be tempted to put
the blame out on others,

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.990 align:middle line:84%
but that's not going to
get us where we need to go.

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Blaming others just adds more
confusion and corruption.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.970 align:middle line:84%
This work needs to be done
on the inner planes in order

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.910 align:middle line:90%
to see that outer shift.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:84%
We need to do the work inwardly,
to heal the imbalances within

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and restore ourselves
to a state of wholeness.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.100 align:middle line:84%
When we do this work, the way
we show up in the world changes,

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and our outer reflection will
then produce different results.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.190 align:middle line:84%
One way we can go
off track with this

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
is if we get consumed
by outer power dynamics.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:38.200 align:middle line:84%
For example, achieving balance
is not about the equality stuff

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.380 align:middle line:84%
that people are talking
about out in the mainstream.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.640 align:middle line:84%
Masculine and feminine
are different,

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.340 align:middle line:90%
and we need to accept that.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
We're different, but that
doesn't mean that we're not

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.650 align:middle line:90%
equally valuable or important.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
We're meant to be
different not the same.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.940 align:middle line:84%
We need to move towards
embracing the differences

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:84%
and yet equally valuing
both feminine and masculine

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.240 align:middle line:84%
qualities, and that's going
to start with us valuing

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.760 align:middle line:90%
the feminine within ourselves.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Do we value the
feminine in our own mind

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.320 align:middle line:90%
or in our way of being?

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Far too often, for
example, women in the world

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.320 align:middle line:84%
think that they need to
prove themselves as worthy,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.680 align:middle line:84%
because they don't value the
innate virtues of the feminine

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:90%
within.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.810 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's because
society hasn't valued it,

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.940 align:middle line:84%
but you know what, let's
take ownership of this,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.990 align:middle line:84%
rather than blaming society
or religion or indoctrination.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:35.290 align:middle line:84%
We need to take ownership,
because we've perpetuated it,

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and we accepted those lies.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.230 align:middle line:84%
When women think that they
have to prove themselves,

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:44.020 align:middle line:84%
it's because they're
not valuing themselves.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And to compensate,
they try to then

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.650 align:middle line:84%
be like men in the masculine
energy of asserting

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and attempting to gain a
sense of self-worth and value

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.400 align:middle line:84%
based on being the best or
receiving outward recognition.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.100 align:middle line:84%
When women don't value
the innate feminine,

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.040 align:middle line:84%
they become denatured
from themselves

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and feel disconnected
from their true power.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.630 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.960 align:middle line:90%
So how do we shift this?

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.908 align:middle line:84%
How do we reclaim the balance
of the masculine and feminine?

00:27:15.908 --> 00:27:17.700 align:middle line:84%
And what we all need
to understand in order

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:90%
to heal this imbalance is this.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.550 align:middle line:84%
The value of the
feminine is the beauty

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:90%
of what dwells within us.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:90%
It's innate.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not something that
requires outward demonstrations

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.970 align:middle line:84%
of achievement in order
to be deemed worthy.

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
It's already worthy.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.050 align:middle line:84%
It's what gives us the power
to birth things into the world.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:90%
It's our innate creative gifts.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Men and women have both feminine
and masculine sides within,

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and the point is to
find the balance.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:90%
But what do we mean by balance?

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.420 align:middle line:84%
How much should
we be in feminine

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.930 align:middle line:84%
versus masculine energy in
order to achieve this balance?

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people think that
balance means equal, 50/50,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
same-same, but what
happens when we have 50/50?

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.060 align:middle line:84%
If we were to look at a set
of scales with equal weight

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
on both sides, everything
balanced out 50/50,

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.710 align:middle line:84%
sure, it's balanced, but
what kind of balance is it?

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a static balance,
meaning there's no movement,

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and if there's no
movement, nothing happens.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:84%
Things stagnate, or they
come to a stalemate,

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:90%
which means we don't progress.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.670 align:middle line:84%
That's not the kind
of balance we want.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.010 align:middle line:90%
So what's our alternative?

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.410 align:middle line:84%
What other kind of
balance can we achieve?

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we want
is a dynamic balance,

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:51.560 align:middle line:84%
one that generates movement,
progression, and life energy.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the kind of balance
we see in nature,

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's according to a
different ratio, not 50/50.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So to gain insight, we can
look to the rules of harmony

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.050 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.630 align:middle line:84%
For example, in music
or sacred geometry,

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:84%
we see harmony
through proportion,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and in musical
harmonies, there's

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:16.440 align:middle line:84%
what's known as the perfect
fifth, which is a 3 to 2 ratio.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Both 2 and 3 also appear
in the Fibonacci sequence

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:22.650 align:middle line:90%
that's found all over nature.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, one way to
visualize this is

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.410 align:middle line:84%
to divide a line into
three equal parts,

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:31.740 align:middle line:84%
and now group two of those
parts together on one side,

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and then the third will
be on the other side.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.920 align:middle line:84%
This then comes out to
about 70% on one side

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:90%
and 30% on the other.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the proportion that
creates a dynamic and yet

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.560 align:middle line:90%
harmonic balance.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:84%
So how do we apply
this to our lives?

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's one
way to look at it.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:55.230 align:middle line:84%
While we all have both feminine
and masculine sides within us,

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
most of us tend to be
predominant in one.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is that we all

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
have an innate way
in which we tend

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.510 align:middle line:90%
to use and flow our energy.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:10.710 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about gender
identity or sexual orientation.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.420 align:middle line:84%
It's also not about
our personality

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and how we've been programmed
to behave in society.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:21.000 align:middle line:84%
This is about energy, and it's
something we're born with.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:84%
For those who are
more innately feminine

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.610 align:middle line:84%
in their use of energy,
then the best balance point

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:31.920 align:middle line:84%
is to run 70% feminine
and 30% masculine.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
While those who are
more innately masculine,

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.680 align:middle line:84%
the balance point would be
the opposite, 70% masculine

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.296 align:middle line:90%
and 30% feminine.

00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, what this does is
create an infinity loop,

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:47.570 align:middle line:84%
where the node of the infinity
loop is at the 1/3 point.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:52.160 align:middle line:84%
This creates a dynamic flow of
energy in the harmonic scale.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And then when we bring
two people together

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:90%
who have opposite polarity--

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.930 align:middle line:84%
one more masculine, the
other more feminine--

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:02.480 align:middle line:84%
the ideal is that they
would then together

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.710 align:middle line:90%
create 100% and 100%.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, not everyone's
going to be the same.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.020 align:middle line:84%
There's a spectrum
around this, of course,

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:17.030 align:middle line:84%
but let's get clear, regardless
of our opinions, identity,

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.500 align:middle line:90%
or sexuality.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:84%
What we're talking about
here is energy flow,

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and we'll know by
the fruits, meaning

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.310 align:middle line:84%
we'll know by the results
it creates in our life,

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.920 align:middle line:90%
whether this is true or not.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Women, we don't have
to prove anything.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.060 align:middle line:84%
The feminine side of us can
birth things into the world,

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.550 align:middle line:90%
and that's powerful enough.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:41.240 align:middle line:84%
The masculine energy
tends to be more active,

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and it seeks to prove itself
by demonstrating its power

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and strength, and that's
OK for the masculine.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.470 align:middle line:84%
But as a woman, I've found
that trying to be in that mode

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.950 align:middle line:84%
all the time is depleting,
and it makes us sick.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:57.710 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to be
all one or the other,

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:01.970 align:middle line:84%
but find your 70/30
balance point.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we see an imbalance
in the world around us,

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and that is a
reflection of what's

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:09.020 align:middle line:90%
happening within each of us.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.710 align:middle line:84%
The feminine needs to shift,
and women in particular

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.050 align:middle line:90%
can lead the way.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:17.450 align:middle line:84%
For men, they're going
to find that the more

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.220 align:middle line:84%
masculine approach
to things will

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.790 align:middle line:84%
be more energizing for them,
and the feminine aspects

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:84%
will still be needed but
only 30% of the time.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is really about
energy, and our indicators

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:84%
are whether we're feeling
depleted and drained

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:90%
or restored and rejuvenated.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.760 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to start
working with this in our lives?

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.860 align:middle line:84%
We can start to connect
with this energy

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.290 align:middle line:90%
through a meditation.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.250 align:middle line:84%
We can engage our energy
centers to embody and flow

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:53.450 align:middle line:84%
masculine and feminine energies
in a more balanced way.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Coming into balance and
flow is key for creation

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.170 align:middle line:90%
and manifestation in the world.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:05.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, as Ein Sof sends
out those seeds of light,

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:07.910 align:middle line:84%
the ideas of what
needs to be created,

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
that outward flow is coming
from a more masculine aspect.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And we can receive that light
in through our third eye,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:90%
or our higher mind.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But first, we have to come
to a quiet mind state,

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:28.320 align:middle line:84%
bringing the mind into
stillness with no thought

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and allowing that
illumination to penetrate

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:35.505 align:middle line:84%
from the mind of
Ein Sof into us.

00:33:35.505 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, as those ideas, those
sparks of light, come in,

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.390 align:middle line:84%
we then need to bring
it into our heart.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:84%
We need to feel it in our
heart and say yes to it.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But if our heart
isn't open, if we

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:84%
haven't done enough
of our healing work,

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to tap in there.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.740 align:middle line:84%
That's why tikkun
is so important.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:84%
When we can bring those
sparks of light into our heart

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and say yes to them, the
feminine and the masculine

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:90%
meet within the heart.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So the masculine energy comes
in through that third eye,

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.639 align:middle line:84%
and then we bring it into the
heart to meet the feminine

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and feel that depth of
good from a heart level.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Then, we bring it
down into the womb.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're a man, you
still have that energy center

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.040 align:middle line:84%
within your hara area,
just below the navel.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.030 align:middle line:84%
So bring it into the womb
area and allow it to grow

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.250 align:middle line:90%
and become fertilized.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.550 align:middle line:84%
It starts to gestate
within the womb.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:44.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's nine minutes or nine
hours, nine days, nine weeks,

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.510 align:middle line:90%
or nine months.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Nine is about the
cycle of completion.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So give it that time and
hold it within the womb space

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.610 align:middle line:90%
to then birth it into the world.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.280 align:middle line:84%
If we want to birth more
light into the world,

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.540 align:middle line:90%
this is the flow.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So we start with stillness,
through meditation and sitting

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.160 align:middle line:84%
still or quieting
ourselves in order

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.240 align:middle line:90%
to receive the light coming in.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.150 align:middle line:84%
As we receive it in
through the third eye

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:22.290 align:middle line:84%
and then bring it into
our heart, breathe into it

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:24.330 align:middle line:90%
and expand it.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:29.370 align:middle line:84%
Bring the breath of life into
that energy, and let it expand.

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Literally, expand your
shoulders and your back,

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:37.160 align:middle line:84%
opening up your chest
as you breathe in.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And then as you breathe out,
let it flow, and bring it down

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.490 align:middle line:90%
into the womb.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:45.570 align:middle line:90%


00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can step into a more
active role, both inwardly

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.610 align:middle line:84%
in the feminine
aspect and outwardly

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:58.290 align:middle line:84%
by moving into a meditative
dance to fully embody it.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, within this
meditation, gently

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:05.550 align:middle line:90%
stand up, and start to move.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Open up the energy centers, and
you can think of, for example,

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.580 align:middle line:84%
rolling the hips in a circle
or in an infinity loop,

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and really open up this
womb and pelvic area.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.660 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like giving
birth in a water tub,

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.100 align:middle line:84%
moving very slowly, doing
these lower body rotations,

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.505 align:middle line:84%
and open up that
birth canal area.

00:36:28.505 --> 00:36:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Opening it all the way up
to give birth, and bring

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:39.770 align:middle line:84%
the energy then down into the
world through the root chakra.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's not dancing but moving
to support an energetic flow.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Moving the hips with the
rotation and infinity

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:54.410 align:middle line:84%
loops, moving clockwise
or in the figure eight

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.990 align:middle line:90%
of the infinity loop.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Move and embody and allow
that energy to just take over,

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:04.670 align:middle line:90%
as you do this movement.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not comfortable
with this physical movement

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:12.030 align:middle line:84%
going on, then just start by
imagining yourself doing it.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, perhaps,
in time, you'll

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:90%
decide to do it physically.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.860 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing here is
we're awakening the passion.

00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.710 align:middle line:84%
We're mixing it in the
body and flowing it

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:84%
with an intense desire
out into the world.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And that desire is meant to come
from a deep place of goodness

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.630 align:middle line:84%
within us, to
awaken our divinity

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:37.450 align:middle line:84%
and to remind others
of their divinity.

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:84%
To bring light into the
world and push forward

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:44.240 align:middle line:90%
toward greater progression.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The process of tikkun is the
great work for each of us,

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.580 align:middle line:84%
as we embark on our
own journey of healing,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.560 align:middle line:84%
our own process
of re-establishing

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:84%
a sustainable and
harmonious balance.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, this leads us
towards greater wholeness

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:04.380 align:middle line:84%
and the reunion between
the Shekinah and her mate.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the transcendent
or masculine aspect

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.690 align:middle line:84%
of the divine and the
embodied, or feminine, aspect

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:14.620 align:middle line:84%
of the divine coming together
into a state of wholeness,

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:90%
union, and ecstatic bliss.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.200 align:middle line:84%
As we do this work for
ourselves in our own lives,

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and we play a role then in
repairing the cosmic vessels

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and helping to accelerate the
progression of the cosmos.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as we dive
deeper into the Kabbalist

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.350 align:middle line:84%
mystic mysteries of
the Sefer Yetzirah,

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:37.840 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Formation
and Creation.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring
the mysteries of Shekinah

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.280 align:middle line:84%
and our healing journey with
me in this episode of "Mystery

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.080 align:middle line:90%
Teachings."
