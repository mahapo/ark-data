Could we be living
inside a hologram?

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.460 align:middle line:10%
What really is a
hologram anyhow?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.620 align:middle line:10%
Let's explore both the
physics and metaphysics

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.410 align:middle line:10%
of holographic being and
what that means for us.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what
is a hologram?

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.450 align:middle line:84%
We've all seen that shiny image
of a dove on the back of a visa

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.700 align:middle line:84%
credit card, or the
hologram trading

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
cards of our favorite
superheroes when we were kids.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:84%
These are two-dimensional
films that

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
have three-dimensional
information encoded in them.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And when light shines on
them in the right way,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
we can see the image as if
it is three dimensional.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
The word, itself,
gives us insight

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.720 align:middle line:90%
into what a hologram is.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the ancient
Greek words holos and gramma.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.215 align:middle line:84%
Holos means hole,
while gramma means

00:01:07.215 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
that which is drawn or
written as in a picture,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
or a drawing, an alphabetical
letter, or piece of writing

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:90%
that contains a message.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Plus, a hologram is
an image or a message

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:90%
that depicts the whole.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are two main defining
features of a hologram.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.860 align:middle line:84%
First, every part contains the
same pattern or information

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
as the whole.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If we break off a piece
of a holographic plate,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
and then shine light onto
it, just that fragment,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.640 align:middle line:84%
it will still contain
the whole image.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
In this regard, it is
fractal-like or recursive,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:84%
meaning it doesn't matter how
small of a scale we go to,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.750 align:middle line:84%
it will still contain the whole
pattern within each piece.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:84%
A large amount of information
is contained in a hologram.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.620 align:middle line:84%
The second defining
feature is that a hologram

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:84%
is a projection from a
lower-dimensional encoding

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:84%
of information about a
higher-dimensional reality.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.720 align:middle line:84%
An easy way to
think about this is

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.000 align:middle line:84%
what happens when we go
to the movie theater.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
The movie we see on the
screen is a projection

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.150 align:middle line:84%
from light shining through
the film in the movie reel.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
That film is imprinted
with images and information

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.760 align:middle line:84%
from the studio
recordings of real people

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.566 align:middle line:90%
acting out their parts.

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The real people are three
dimensional in this case,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.340 align:middle line:90%
but the film is two dimensional.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And we watch that
movie being projected

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
onto a two-dimensional
screen as well.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So this example is
not holographic,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
but it gives us an idea of
what is meant by a projection

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.140 align:middle line:84%
from a lower-dimensional
encoding of information

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.660 align:middle line:84%
about a higher-dimensional
reality.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.960 align:middle line:84%
If the movie were recorded
using holographic methods,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.090 align:middle line:84%
our experience of
watching the movie

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
might be more like what's
depicted in, perhaps,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.160 align:middle line:90%
the holodeck of Star Trek.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.880 align:middle line:84%
We often hear talk of raising
up to higher dimensions.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And what is meant by dimension?

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's define this
word so that we can

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:90%
be clear about what we mean.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Dimensions, the way we usually
relate to them in science,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.450 align:middle line:84%
mean coordinates
within spacetime

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.160 align:middle line:84%
that measure height, width,
depth, duration, and so forth.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
A single reference point
is zero dimensional.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's call that the origin.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Two points define
a line or direction

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:90%
creating one dimension.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:10%
Two lines at
perpendicular directions

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:10%
form a flat plain,
giving us two dimensions.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.700 align:middle line:10%
And three perpendicular lines
create three dimensions,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:10%
and so on.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
We can continue doing this
to get higher and higher

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:90%
dimensions beyond our 3D world.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.370 align:middle line:84%
For example, here
is what is called

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:84%
a hypercube or tesseract which
is a four-dimensional version

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
of a cube.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
But in that four
dimensional reality,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
it is also constantly moving
or folding and unfolding.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
We can also look
at a torus which

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.400 align:middle line:84%
is a four-dimensional
sphere or a cylinder

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:90%
depending on how it's formed.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The shape of the torus
is found all over nature.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
Anytime there is
a magnetic field

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:84%
flowing between two poles, it
takes on the form of a torus.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
This includes the energy
field around galaxies, stars,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:90%
planets, even us.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It is the shape and
dynamic flow of our aura.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Current string theories propose
that there is up to 10 or 11

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:90%
spatial dimensions plus time.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.040 align:middle line:84%
However, since our senses
and perceptions are only

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:84%
trained to be aware of
three dimensions, most of us

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.680 align:middle line:84%
do not see the full
form of anything

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:90%
from a higher dimension.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.780 align:middle line:84%
At best, we can see a
slice or projection of it

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.130 align:middle line:84%
in our 3D experience,
kind of like a shadow.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
We can easily grasp
this idea when

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:84%
we look at a
three-dimensional object

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to its different
projections onto 2D planes.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Such as a cylinder
that can be seen

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:84%
as either a
rectangle or a circle

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.390 align:middle line:84%
depending on which
two-dimensional perspective we

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%
are viewing it from.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:84%
A four-dimensional tesseract
projected into our 3D awareness

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
could look like any
of these images,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
among others, depending
on the perspective

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:90%
and as current confirmation.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Most mandalas, from
either Eastern or Western

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.210 align:middle line:84%
spiritual traditions, are also
two-dimensional projections

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:84%
of 3D or
higher-dimensional forms.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:84%
One way to use this is
to visualize geometries

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:90%
of different dimensions.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, we could start
by visualizing ourselves

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.750 align:middle line:84%
at the center, or
somewhere inside of us

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:90%
is the origin point.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Then from that center,
a line extends out--

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
let's say it goes
out about nine feet.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
If we then rotate this
line clockwise around us,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
it forms a two-dimensional
circle and the line

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.210 align:middle line:90%
being the radius.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:10%
If we rotate the circle
again, only this time

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.250 align:middle line:10%
around the axis of its radius,
then it will create a sphere.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we can fold that
sphere inward upon itself, down

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:84%
through our central
core to make a torus,

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
then feel or see that
movement around us as well

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:90%
as through our central core.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
This is a really good
way to train our mind

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and expand our awareness
to consciously work

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
with the sacred geometries
that are already a part of us.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.930 align:middle line:84%
As we do, we become
more aware of what

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.340 align:middle line:84%
is happening in
our energy field,

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and we also become
more multi-dimensional

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:90%
in our consciousness.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So raising up to
higher dimensions

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
would be to become
consciously aware

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.380 align:middle line:84%
of this multidimensional
reality around us.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
However, some people also
use this phrase in relation

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to shifting to higher
frequency levels which

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.470 align:middle line:90%
is different than dimension.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, with this dimensional
awareness in mind,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:84%
the next question
we want to explore

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.820 align:middle line:90%
is how to holograms really work?

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.800 align:middle line:84%
It begins with a coherent
source of energy.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
It could be laser light or
sound or some other type

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:90%
of coherent energy wave.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
This is directed to a dividing
mirror that then splits

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.800 align:middle line:90%
the light into two paths.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
One path sends that
light straight through,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and the other path sends
that light towards an object.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
That object is then illuminated,
and the light scatters back off

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of it, some of which
then recombines

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
with the light that went
straight through the mirror.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
As these two light
streams recombine,

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
they form what is called
an interference pattern.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.860 align:middle line:84%
This interference pattern
is then imprinted or encoded

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.710 align:middle line:84%
onto a holographic
film which captures

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.550 align:middle line:84%
like a snapshot or a moment
in time of the object,

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:84%
much like taking a
selfie or a picture.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, when some
other light source

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
shines onto that
holographic film,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
that light then reflects off
of it carrying the information

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.950 align:middle line:90%
of the holographic pattern.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Those light waves
travel to our eyes which

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
detect these signals
of information,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
communicating that to our
brain, and then the brain

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:84%
renders the
three-dimensional-like image

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive before us.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
As Buckminster Fuller put
it, "Everything we see

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.920 align:middle line:90%
is inside our own heads."

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.050 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to how
we see rainbows.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow is not out there,
the rainbow is in here.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.580 align:middle line:10%
And as Leonardo da Vinci
said, "All our knowledge

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.088 align:middle line:10%
has its origin in
our perceptions."

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, hold on, let's back
up here for a second.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, our experience of
this world is not like 3D,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
it is 3D, and it
feels very real.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:84%
We can touch it, taste it,
hear it, smell it, see it.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.610 align:middle line:10%
We feel the pain and
pleasures from it, so

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:10%
how can this be a hologram?

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's apply
the same model,

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.790 align:middle line:84%
but now let's take it up
to a higher dimension.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember in Star
Wars where R2-D2

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:84%
projects a
three-dimensional hologram

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.700 align:middle line:90%
movie of Princess Leia?

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Or as mentioned before, we
could also think of the holodeck

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:90%
experience in Star Trek?

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:10%
What if there were some kind
of holographic substrate

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:10%
similar to this that
was being projected

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:10%
into our universe, the kind that
could record in time and space

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:10%
and then project that into
an actual 3D experience.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And what if we could also have
a multi sensory interaction

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.260 align:middle line:84%
with it, like we can now do
in some of our virtual reality

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.940 align:middle line:90%
games.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:84%
I went to one of these
experiences called The Void

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:90%
with a Star Wars theme.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And I was rather impressed
by how realistic it felt.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:90%
It was interactive.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:84%
It even had temperature
changes, smells,

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and a vest that gave me a little
zap in the ribs every time

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:90%
I got shot by a storm trooper.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I even yelped every
time I got zapped.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And we really felt like we were
in the Star Wars experience.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't perfect.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.710 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like the "Matrix"
movies or "Ready Player One,"

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:84%
but our technologies
are really coming along.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Anyhow, what if true reality
is a four-dimensional

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
or five-dimensional or even
higher-dimensional realm

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and what we experience
here is just

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.300 align:middle line:84%
a three-dimensional
holographic projection?

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:10%
We don't need all the
fancy virtual reality gear

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.120 align:middle line:10%
to have a sensory
experience of it.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:10%
All that would be needed is
to send the right signals

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.230 align:middle line:10%
and information into our brain
to stimulate those perceptions.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:10%
Much like what
happens in our dreams,

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.180 align:middle line:10%
dreams feel very real
when we are in them

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:10%
even though we experience
things that would be

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:10%
impossible in our waking life.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.700 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way, our
physical experience of life

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.850 align:middle line:84%
feels very real, and
at some level it is,

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the whole reality.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Our five physical
senses are only

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.880 align:middle line:84%
attuned to the
three-dimensional world.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And even then, we only
perceive a small fraction

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:84%
of the information available
in the physical world.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:84%
We can not rely on just
our physical senses

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:84%
to inform us of what
true reality is.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.320 align:middle line:84%
Most people only
perceive about one octave

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic
spectrum that we

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
call visible light ranging
from red to violet in color.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.100 align:middle line:84%
But we know from science that
there are many more wavelengths

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.440 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic
energy flowing all

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:90%
around us all the time.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:90%
The same goes for other senses.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Each of them detect only a small
portion of the energy spectra

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.890 align:middle line:90%
around us.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And what's more, most people
aren't even paying attention

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on around them.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:10%
Their senses might be
picking up the signals,

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.810 align:middle line:10%
but they are tuned out and not
aware of what's happening thus,

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:10%
relying on subconscious
mind to process

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:10%
all that information coming in.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, our
subconscious mind

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.680 align:middle line:84%
is full of all
kinds of distortions

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
and faulty programming
that blocks or skews

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:90%
our perceptions.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:10%
The subconscious then
influences our ego

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:10%
and causes us to
perceive separation

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.020 align:middle line:10%
between ourselves and others.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:84%
This perception of separation
is definitely an illusion.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Such lack of awareness
is a major thing

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
we need to train
ourselves out of.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It starts by paying attention
and not making assumptions.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:84%
We must train ourselves
to really look

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and tune into what is
happening around us.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:84%
We must become consciously
aware of our environment

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.200 align:middle line:84%
and ourselves if we want
to achieve inner mastery.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Then to start perceiving the
higher dimensional realities,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
we also need to train
our intuitive senses,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.200 align:middle line:84%
our extrasensory
perception abilities.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:84%
First, we become aware
of subtle details

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.570 align:middle line:90%
that we might ordinarily ignore.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
The more we do this
through repetition,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:84%
the more we help
our brain to rewire

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become better
at perceiving subtle energies.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:53.240 align:middle line:84%
The more we are aware of our
energy field and train our ESP,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
or what we call our
spiritual senses,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:84%
we can then link this with
our five physical senses.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:84%
The more we do this,
the more we can

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.000 align:middle line:84%
become like Superman or
Lucy with X-ray vision,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
keen hearing, and access
to higher consciousness.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Only from higher
consciousness can

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
we move beyond perceiving
just the hologram.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Like in the "Matrix" movies,
when they get out of the Matrix

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.580 align:middle line:84%
into Zion, they are able to see
the Matrix for what it really

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:90%
is from the encoding level.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And from that
level of awareness,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.690 align:middle line:84%
we can learn to harness
the Matrix to become

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
more at cause, rather
than always at the effect.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.130 align:middle line:90%
Is this just science fiction?

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Could it be science fact?

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And where does consciousness
fit into all of this?

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not it is true
still remains to be seen,

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
but there are many
fascinating questions

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:84%
that this holographic
model brings up.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's turn to science now to see
how this holographic idea has

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.610 align:middle line:90%
been implemented.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.430 align:middle line:10%
One of the first
theoretical physicists

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.630 align:middle line:10%
to propose the
idea of a hologram

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:10%
as a model for the universe
was David Bohm in the late '70s

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.760 align:middle line:10%
and early '80s.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Bohm realized that
one of the only ways

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to account for quantum
physics, general relativity,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness was to
start from what they all

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.510 align:middle line:90%
have in common.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:84%
They all point to a
fundamental unbroken wholeness

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:84%
or connectedness
in the universe.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:84%
His desire to tie these
together and move away

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.650 align:middle line:84%
from the notion of
separation is what

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
led Bohm to propose what he
called the "implicate order."

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
He felt that one of the biggest
issues on the planet right

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
now is that we
continue to experience

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.360 align:middle line:84%
greater levels of separation,
isolation, and fragmentation

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:84%
This is very much an
issue in our world today,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:90%
perhaps, even more than ever.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:84%
What did Bohm mean by
an implicate order?

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
It's rather involved, but
let's use a simple analogy

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.230 align:middle line:90%
to convey the idea.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have heard the
popular fable of the "Blind Men

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:90%
and the Elephant."

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Six blind men come across
an elephant, something they

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.760 align:middle line:90%
have never encountered before.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And each one feels a
different part of the body.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:84%
One has a leg, another
a tusk, one an ear,

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.910 align:middle line:84%
a knee, the snout,
the tail, and so on.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:84%
Each blind man devises his own
version of objective reality

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.010 align:middle line:84%
to describe the
elephant, but it's

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:84%
based on a very
limited experience

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:90%
and partial perspective.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.110 align:middle line:84%
They each have part of the
truth but not the whole truth,

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and their partial truths are
a far cry from describing

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.230 align:middle line:90%
the actual elephant as a whole.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
The outer form of the
body and its parts

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.500 align:middle line:84%
are what Bohm might relate
to the explicate order--

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
the things we can experience,
perceive, and measure

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:90%
in our sensory world.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Most of the laws of
physics thus far,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.260 align:middle line:84%
both classical and
quantum, mainly

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:90%
refer to this explicate order.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the whole
elephant, including

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
all the inner workings of its
body, life, and consciousness,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.240 align:middle line:84%
the things that we
can't see or touch,

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:84%
this is like the
implicate order.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Within the implicate order
are all the deeper aspects

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:90%
of an unbroken wholeness.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.420 align:middle line:84%
This implicate order is also
alive with constant motion.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:84%
As aspects come to
the surface, they

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
can be experienced or perceived
in the explicate order.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.550 align:middle line:84%
But when they are
enfolded back in,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.300 align:middle line:84%
they are part of
the implicate order.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Bohm wondered, how can
we explore or grasp

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.190 align:middle line:84%
this implicate order,
the whole elephant?

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And as a metaphor for
shifting our way of thinking,

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.360 align:middle line:90%
he proposed a hologram model.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.410 align:middle line:84%
In Bohm's model, the explicate
order, or 3D-physical world

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.200 align:middle line:84%
that we experience,
is like a projection

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:90%
from a holographic encoding.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.440 align:middle line:84%
While the implicate order refers
to the higher-dimensional realm

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:84%
where the original more whole
being resides, moves, and is

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:90%
eliminated.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
He says the explicate order or
hologram is part of the truth

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.110 align:middle line:90%
but not the whole truth.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.959 align:middle line:84%
The whole truth is found within
the implicate order or higher

00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:04.759 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:84%
When Bohm proposed the hologram
idea in the late 1970s,

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:90%
it was used as just a metaphor.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:84%
But could there be
more to it than that?

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:20.099 align:middle line:84%
In the mid to late '90s,
other theoretical physicists

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
started using the hologram
idea as a mathematical way

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
to try to unite quantum
mechanics with gravity.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Briefly, they said these
two core pillars of physics

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
could be united if
we considered them

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to be holographic projections
from a lower-dimensional

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:90%
encoding of information.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:84%
For example, all the
information of a black hole

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:84%
is encoded just in its
event horizon, which

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.910 align:middle line:90%
is a two-dimensional surface.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
They propose that any
three-dimensional volume

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.000 align:middle line:84%
can be mathematically
described entirely

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:84%
through the two-dimensional
boundary or surface

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.380 align:middle line:90%
region that surrounds it.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:84%
This sounds complicated,
but one simple way for us

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:84%
to relate to this
idea is to imagine

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.080 align:middle line:84%
that all the information
about our entire body--

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.870 align:middle line:84%
all its organs, its
nerves, everything--

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.960 align:middle line:84%
is encoded on the
surface of our skin.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
This boundary is where the
holographic information

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
is encoded.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
This might not be
that far-fetched.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
There are actually some ancient
systems of Eastern medicine

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:26.460 align:middle line:84%
that do assess the qualities
of the skin to diagnose

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.710 align:middle line:90%
issues inside the body.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
One interesting consequence
of this holographic principle

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:90%
is that it says that spacetime--

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.870 align:middle line:90%
gravity, mass, and even energy--

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
are illusory.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words, everything
we perceive as real

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:90%
is a kind of mirage.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.360 align:middle line:84%
They simply emerge
from the projection

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
of information encoded in the
lower-dimensional hologram

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:90%
surface.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.770 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.750 align:middle line:84%
What these scientists are saying
is that what is fundamental

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.130 align:middle line:90%
is not the thing.

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it's the
encoded information

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%
that gives rise to the thing.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:90%
Let's repeat that.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Physicists are now saying that
the most fundamental component

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:84%
of our universe and
everything in it

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:84%
is not mass, not
gravity, not spacetime,

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:20.380 align:middle line:84%
not even energy or subatomic
particles, it's information.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean that
this physical world

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.800 align:middle line:84%
with all its mass, gravity,
space, time, and energy

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is an illusion,
like many interpret

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:84%
the spiritual philosophy
of Maya to mean?

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.650 align:middle line:90%
Not exactly.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:10%
From a physics
perspective, we'd say

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:10%
that this physicality that
we experience is real,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:10%
it's just not fundamental.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not the deepest reality.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we'd say it is emergent
from the information encoded

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.970 align:middle line:84%
in the hologram,
while the deeper

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
reality or implicate order
is the level that controls

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.910 align:middle line:90%
the encoding of the hologram.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
there is an illusion,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and that, as
mentioned earlier, is

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:90%
in our perception of reality.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
This physical
world is real, it's

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:90%
just not the whole reality.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Part of why we're in this
experience is to learn from it,

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
so it's best not to
dismiss it as not real.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.160 align:middle line:84%
But we should question our
perceptions and interpretation

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.050 align:middle line:84%
of this physicality because
that is where the illusion lies.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Where might this information
that encodes the hologram

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:25.800 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Some physicists
propose string theories

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and end theory as
ways to accomplish

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.700 align:middle line:90%
this encoding of information.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Recall that those
theories go all the way

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
up to 10 or 11 dimensions
to find the level where

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:90%
things unify.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:84%
However, this science
still doesn't tell us

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
where information
comes from originally.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:90%
It tells us more of the how.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Other scientists propose
the information is encoded

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.910 align:middle line:84%
upon the quantum
vacuum of empty space,

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.650 align:middle line:84%
and that it comes
from the multiverse.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics has
shown that what we think

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.470 align:middle line:90%
of as real and solid is not.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It's made of
99.999999999% empty space.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Within that
so-called empty space

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
are fields of energy that are
constantly vibrating, moving,

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.740 align:middle line:90%
shifting in and out of states.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.060 align:middle line:84%
We can think of them like waves
of energy on an endless sea.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:84%
As these waves intersect, they
form interference patterns

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:90%
that modulate that quantum sea.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The waves and
interference patterns

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:84%
contain the holographic
information.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But what if all the
information and stimuli

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
we experience in our
three-dimensional world

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:90%
are not only waves?

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
What if they're
merely the surface

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:90%
level of an infinite sea?

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Have we become so
caught up in trying

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
to understand and navigate
the surface that we've

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:84%
missed the fact that there
is a vast ocean full of life

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and deeper realms
waiting to be explored?

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:90%
This is what Bohm proposed.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.940 align:middle line:84%
He said that the implicate
order is the deeper ocean,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:84%
while the explicate order is
just the surface information.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:84%
He believed that when we began
to explore that deeper ocean,

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that is when we will
find the true reality

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.520 align:middle line:84%
that our whole world
is an image of.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Is using the holographic model
as just a metaphor or even

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:84%
a mathematical trick to
unify physics equations,

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.110 align:middle line:84%
is that as far as
this goes, or is there

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.760 align:middle line:84%
a more literal
interpretation to it?

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
The first substantial
physical evidence

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
in support of our
universe being a hologram

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.210 align:middle line:84%
came in 2017 when
scientists were finally

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.050 align:middle line:84%
able to take a detailed look at
the cosmic microwave background

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:43.310 align:middle line:90%
radiation.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
They discovered, within this
afterglow of the Big Bang,

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.810 align:middle line:84%
that there are encoded fractal
patterns of information.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:84%
These patterns seem to be
encoded within spacetime

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:57.770 align:middle line:84%
itself, and they repeat
at almost all scales,

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:02.570 align:middle line:84%
just like we'd expect to find
in a holographic substrate.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:05.180 align:middle line:84%
These encoded patterns
determine where

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.450 align:middle line:84%
stars and galaxies and
interstellar structures

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.400 align:middle line:90%
of the universe are formed.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:84%
They give birth to the
forms of our universe

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:90%
at almost every scale.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.880 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty cool.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
What strikes me about
all of this more

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:84%
recent scientific approach
to the holographic model,

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
though, is that
scientists are now so

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.240 align:middle line:84%
focused on that
lower-dimensional encoding

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
of information, meaning the
two-dimensional surface waves,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:84%
rather than on the
level of true reality

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.460 align:middle line:84%
where the encoding
actually came from.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.050 align:middle line:84%
They might be one step closer,
but they are still attached

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.090 align:middle line:90%
to the explicate order.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
This attachment or bias
towards materiality

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.130 align:middle line:84%
prevents them from
piercing the veil

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.950 align:middle line:90%
to discover the implicate order.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Have we reached
the limits to what

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:54.680 align:middle line:84%
object-based approach of
physics can directly observe?

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Quite possibly yes,
at least for now.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Can pure mathematics
and geometry

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:84%
serve as a way to
gain deeper insight?

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.010 align:middle line:90%
Perhaps.

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Or have we come
to the point where

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.410 align:middle line:84%
we must cross the bridge
from the world of physics

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.230 align:middle line:84%
into the world of
metaphysics to gain insight?

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
In the mystery
school tradition, we

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
explore many esoteric
questions that

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:90%
arise from concepts like these.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, we could
ask if this world

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.220 align:middle line:84%
is a holographic projection,
where is the real me?

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, I'm not the image
you see on your screen.

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
The holographic principle says
I'm not leaving this body that

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:90%
is here in the studio at Gaia.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that we
are just information

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:42.140 align:middle line:84%
encoded on some two-dimensional
boundary only appearing as 3D?

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe our body
might be the result

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.670 align:middle line:84%
of encoded information
such as in our DNA,

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.330 align:middle line:90%
but we are not our body.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:90%
We are much more than this.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Could our true self be that
original illuminated form

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:00.650 align:middle line:84%
which the hologram is
simply an encoding of?

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.770 align:middle line:84%
This feels closer to
the greater truth.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:84%
If this is the case, then
where is our original form?

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:10.220 align:middle line:90%
What are we?

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:13.130 align:middle line:84%
These are the kinds of questions
that initiates and sages have

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.920 align:middle line:90%
been asking for millennia.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:10%
The famous depth psychologist
from their early 1900s,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Carl Jung, studied deeply
into questions like these.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.130 align:middle line:84%
He drew from the mystery
school tradition of alchemy

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.610 align:middle line:84%
and the shamanic tradition
of dream interpretation.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Jung observed that similar
images, symbols, and motifs

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
were showing up in dreams
of several of his patients.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.740 align:middle line:84%
He also knew that many of
these images and symbols

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.340 align:middle line:84%
had been used in alchemical
artwork from the Middle Ages

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as many
ancient mythologies

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.940 align:middle line:90%
from around the world.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Jung realized they all
pointed to similar themes

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.820 align:middle line:84%
or specific
transformational processes

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.410 align:middle line:84%
that must be part of a
collective or universal nature.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:84%
These universal images,
symbols, and themes

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.620 align:middle line:84%
are the ways in which we
receive information from what

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:90%
are called archetypes.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.530 align:middle line:84%
The word archetype goes back
to at least ancient Greek

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and means an original
form, model, or pattern

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.860 align:middle line:90%
from which copies are made.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:19.400 align:middle line:84%
These archetypes are
the original forms that

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.500 align:middle line:90%
operate in higher dimensions.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.850 align:middle line:84%
They communicate
to and through us

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.050 align:middle line:84%
via symbols,
synchronicities, and patterns

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.180 align:middle line:90%
that interact with our psyche.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.600 align:middle line:84%
We can also use these
archetypal symbols and patterns

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to communicate back
to the higher realms.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.170 align:middle line:84%
By correctly incorporating them
into practices such as ritual,

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
guided visualizations, the
use of active imagination,

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and even magical
talismans, they become

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.340 align:middle line:84%
like calling cards or
links to the higher realms.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.310 align:middle line:84%
In the magical
arts and sciences,

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.950 align:middle line:84%
using symbols in
this way is known

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:58.430 align:middle line:84%
as sympathetic magic,
which relates to the idea

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:90%
that at a spiritual level--

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.310 align:middle line:90%
like attracts like.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Jung called the realm where
these archetypes reside

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.470 align:middle line:90%
the collective unconscious.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.440 align:middle line:84%
We are all connected to
it through our psyche

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.420 align:middle line:84%
or in what today's
terminology we

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.400 align:middle line:90%
might call our consciousness.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But there is a difference
between consciousness

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:84%
as we experience it in
our thoughts, dreams,

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:22.620 align:middle line:84%
or imagination and
the underlying essence

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.420 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness itself.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.460 align:middle line:84%
We might call this
underlying essence

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.540 align:middle line:84%
pure awareness or spirit
intelligence which operates

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.270 align:middle line:90%
at the archetypal level.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.030 align:middle line:84%
These archetypes
or original forms

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.940 align:middle line:84%
have also been referred to in
various spiritual traditions

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.740 align:middle line:84%
as gods, as angelic beings,
and as forces of creation.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Our original form, our true
self, our eternal being

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:84%
resides here at the
archetypal level

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.550 align:middle line:84%
in the sea of
collective unconscious.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:84%
From a physics
standpoint, that sea

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.590 align:middle line:84%
is the depths of
the quantum sea,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:01.330 align:middle line:90%
the ocean of the multiverse.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the archetypes move in
that sea, they create waves.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Then as coherent energy from
source shines upon them,

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.520 align:middle line:84%
their information and
interference patterns

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.030 align:middle line:84%
get encoded on the
surface of that sea.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness, matter, and
all the forms and forces

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:23.130 align:middle line:84%
we experience in this realm
are just projections or ripple

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
effects from these waves of
that infinite quantum sea.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But the encoding
level is the level

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:33.870 align:middle line:84%
of our eternal divine being,
and that is the part of us

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.200 align:middle line:84%
that we must get
back in tune with.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.110 align:middle line:84%
What about the
illuminating source

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
that provides the
coherent energy wave

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:90%
needed to create the encoding?

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:46.650 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, coherent energy means
that is of one frequency

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and fully synchronized
like we might

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.000 align:middle line:84%
find in a laser of either
light or acoustic energy.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.440 align:middle line:84%
In the kabbalistic
tradition it is

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.320 align:middle line:84%
called Ein Sof which means
infinite and without end.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we call it, let's just
say source to make it easy.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:90%
"It" is transcendent.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it also resides
beyond our universe,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:15.210 align:middle line:84%
yet it projects itself
into our universe

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.670 align:middle line:84%
by sending out
its rays of energy

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.400 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring all
the archetypal forms

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and potentials from the
quantum sea into expression.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Here we come to perhaps the
biggest question of all?

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.420 align:middle line:90%
Can we influence the hologram?

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Can we change things?

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And how does our consciousness
fit into all of this?

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.830 align:middle line:84%
In physics today, there
is something known

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.700 align:middle line:90%
as the measurement problem.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a problem to
traditional scientists

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:84%
because it says that our
universe is participatory.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
What we observe is
determined by how

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.590 align:middle line:84%
we set up the experiment or
the way we choose to observe.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
What it says is
that consciousness

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
does influence what information
emerges from the hologram.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.840 align:middle line:84%
However, that
doesn't necessarily

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.910 align:middle line:90%
mean we are changing it.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It could just be that
our choices are simply

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.460 align:middle line:84%
moving it or tuning into
different frequency levels

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.260 align:middle line:84%
like turning the
dial on the radio

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
to tune in to a
different station.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The information being
broadcast from that station

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:84%
was always there, but
we only perceive it

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.850 align:middle line:84%
when we change the
dial to that frequency.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
These are examples that show
us of how our choices might

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.840 align:middle line:84%
be giving us a slightly
different perspective

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.510 align:middle line:84%
of information as
opposed to changing

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:90%
things at a fundamental level.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Still, if there truly is
a universal connectedness

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%
as science now confirms, then
if we can change ourselves,

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:84%
this must have an
impact on the whole.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.150 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to the hermetic
Principle of Correspondence

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:84%
from the 8,000-year-old
lineage of Hermes.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the famous "as
above, so below" principle.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.440 align:middle line:84%
It can also be stated as
the inner, so the outer, as

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:02.190 align:middle line:84%
the outer, so the inner,
or as the microcosm,

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.990 align:middle line:90%
so the macrocosm.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, one of the defining
features of a hologram

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.500 align:middle line:84%
is that every part
contains the same pattern

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.690 align:middle line:90%
or information as the whole.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:84%
This is what "as
above, so below" means.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.310 align:middle line:10%
So the principle
of correspondence

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.060 align:middle line:10%
is a holographic principle.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.090 align:middle line:10%
And the hologram is both
inside and outside--

00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:26.550 align:middle line:10%
as the inner, so the outer.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:84%
In the hermetic lineage, we
have many tools and teachings

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:84%
about how to shift
the inner so that we

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.450 align:middle line:90%
can influence the outer.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic ray or
path is about purity.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.140 align:middle line:84%
We seek to purify
our mind and life

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:44.310 align:middle line:84%
so that we can truly express our
multi-dimensional potentials.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Rather than saying that the
problem is outside of us

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.620 align:middle line:84%
or even in the
holographic encoding,

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:54.480 align:middle line:84%
the real issue is the way in
which we each distort its image

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.690 align:middle line:84%
through our filters, fears,
and imbalances stored

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.820 align:middle line:90%
in that subconscious mind.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:03.330 align:middle line:84%
What if our original encoding
is full of goodness and beauty

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and strength?

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:06.880 align:middle line:84%
What if we are simply
blocking ourselves

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.570 align:middle line:84%
from experiencing the fullness
of our true form here?

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And if that's the case, our task
is not to change the hologram

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.870 align:middle line:84%
but simply to clean up our
filters and blocks so that we

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.900 align:middle line:84%
can actually express
our original blueprints

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.442 align:middle line:90%
in their pure and whole form.

00:32:25.442 --> 00:32:27.400 align:middle line:84%
The kabbalistic tradition
talks about something

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.080 align:middle line:84%
called tikkun which means
to rectify, repair, or heal.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.030 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life
is a pattern that

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.300 align:middle line:84%
can be applied at many
scales holographically.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.400 align:middle line:84%
One of those ways
we can apply it

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:90%
is to our mind and perceptions.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:44.680 align:middle line:84%
In this model, the top
of the tree of life

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.920 align:middle line:84%
is called the supernal
triad, and this represents

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:50.100 align:middle line:90%
the realm of source energy.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The very bottom
point on the tree

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:84%
represents the physical kingdom,
the world in which we live.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:33:00.160 align:middle line:10%
Everything in-between
represents levels of soul

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:10%
which includes the
mind and how it works.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.270 align:middle line:84%
This is like our
operating system--

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:84%
the applications
and memory files--

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:90%
it's the software programs.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.210 align:middle line:84%
We can think of each of these
spheres as lenses or mirrors

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.840 align:middle line:84%
or applications that take
in the light from source

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and then pass that
down to the next level.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:24.040 align:middle line:84%
If any of those spheres
are distorted, cracked,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.500 align:middle line:84%
or faulty in their
intended function,

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.900 align:middle line:84%
then that skews or
blocks the light

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:84%
as it comes down
to the physical.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah teaches
us that our mission

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is to repair those spheres so
that the light can flow down

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.180 align:middle line:90%
in its fullness and purity.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.910 align:middle line:84%
When we take up this work
of healing and repairing

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.790 align:middle line:84%
our filters, our
mind and our soul,

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.670 align:middle line:84%
we will then automatically
begin to manifest

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:52.730 align:middle line:84%
more of the divine light
that flows from source.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:84%
These are truly the first
steps of the initiate

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.900 align:middle line:84%
as we progress on our path to
understanding the mysteries

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves and the universe--

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:90%
the microcosm and the macrocosm.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.710 align:middle line:84%
The more alive and
awakened we become,

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.500 align:middle line:84%
the more we feel
called to serve others

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.590 align:middle line:90%
and to help them to do the same.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:84%
Thus the higher
steps of progression

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.310 align:middle line:84%
on the path of
initiation is to move

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
into higher levels of
service in the light

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.300 align:middle line:84%
so that we can aid in the
awakening of humanity.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:26.110 align:middle line:84%
The more we heal and realign
with our true light and true

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:84%
self, the more we can manifest
that light into this world

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:84%
and build a better
world, one based

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.949 align:middle line:84%
on our wholeness and divinity
rather than on separation

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:90%
and ego.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Our task in this
hologram is to become

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.610 align:middle line:84%
more pure and complete image
or expression of the whole.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we discover
how to access the quantum

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.969 align:middle line:84%
gap and the infinite
potential contained

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.780 align:middle line:84%
within the zero-point
field or quantum sea.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:03.690 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with me in this
episode of "Mystery Teachings."

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.176 align:middle line:90%
