00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
How do we truly become
the captain of our ship

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:10%
to master ourselves and the kind
of impact we make in the world?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we open up
the hood of our own vehicles,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:10%
so to speak, to take a look
at the engine that drives us

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.965 align:middle line:10%
and how it really works.

00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.160 align:middle line:84%
When we're exposed to
vibrational energy,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:84%
we want to get to the point
where we can consciously

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.170 align:middle line:84%
use it to raise
our own vibration

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.660 align:middle line:90%
and live the alchemy of life.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Vibrational energy all
begins at the source,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:84%
the unmanifested potential,
the one mind, the Ein Sof.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.240 align:middle line:84%
We can also call it
spirit, light, love, will,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:90%
divine energy.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
As we explored in
season one, all energy

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.610 align:middle line:84%
flows from the source
through the various layers

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:84%
of density and vibration via a
projection into the hologram.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.060 align:middle line:84%
It comes to us in the
form of frequency patterns

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that create a stimulus
at this density level.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:84%
These patterns of energy
carry archetypal information,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:90%
some sort of original intent.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
As that energy comes into us
it creates a vibrational change

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.110 align:middle line:90%
within us at multiple levels.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:84%
This can then
emanate out from us

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:84%
to make vibrational changes
in our surroundings.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So what do we do with
this energy or stimulus?

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:90%
How do we best use it?

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, we're going to harness
it to intentionally create

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
the changes that
raise our vibration,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
therefore causing a
more positive impact

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
on our surroundings
and the world.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
To do this, we
need to understand

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
how that information
or energy processes

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:90%
through us on the inner planes.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.580 align:middle line:84%
As we do, we can be more active
and conscious participants

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:90%
in this experience of life.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
We can be more
empowered to exercise

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:84%
our will, our choices for
how we put the energy out

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:84%
into the world
through our actions.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Gaining understanding
of how this works

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.990 align:middle line:84%
also empowers us to figure
out where things sometimes

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:90%
go wrong.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Only then can we
choose to correct it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and overcome self sabotage
or destructive patterns

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
In the Western Mystery
School tradition,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.600 align:middle line:84%
we go deep into this especially
with the Kabbalistic teachings

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
the tree of life.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
We come to understand
who we truly

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
are and the pattern
of how our mind works.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.270 align:middle line:84%
This is at the core, the key
framework for this process.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah teaches us the
programming language

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
of the mind and soul,
the energetic framework

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.050 align:middle line:90%
that governs how we operate.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.620 align:middle line:84%
With this knowledge, we can
gain greater self mastery.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.310 align:middle line:84%
This begins by
realizing two things.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
First, that there is an
alchemical process going on,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.400 align:middle line:84%
meaning a process that the
vibrational energy goes through

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
before we interpret or
act upon that stimulus.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason behind how
that alchemical process works

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
within us and in the
world through us.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a reason to
it, a science, that means we

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:90%
can learn how it works.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And with this understanding,
we can more proactively direct

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
this process for the good
of ourselves and all others.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:84%
The second thing to realize
is that with anything,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:84%
any stimulus that comes in
as energy or information,

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
down to the atomic level,
all this energy is sentient.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:84%
This means that there is
a form of consciousness

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:90%
underlying all things.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And there is a system
to how that sentient

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.810 align:middle line:90%
energy flows to and through us.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.305 align:middle line:84%
This experiential
world is systematic.

00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
We want to get to
the point where

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
we can bring in
energy and stimuli

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
that innately excites us, energy
that helps us to activate more

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
of our gifts and potentials,
rather than stimulus

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that can drag us
down or interfere

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.150 align:middle line:90%
with our awakening process.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So to do this, we
have to understand

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
how our neurological
system and mind work,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
how we process and
perceive information,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
and how that feeds
back into the system.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
This means raising our
energy in a way that

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.540 align:middle line:84%
does not bring in pollution
or distortion of any kind.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:84%
We want to bring in a stimulus
that is of a pure vibration.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
The key is that we bring
in the correct stimuli that

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.240 align:middle line:90%
are harmonizing.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
In the hermetic lineage, we say
that the first ray from source,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
the hermetic ray
is about purity,

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.460 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's of
a pure vibration.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So correct stimulus is one that
comes from that higher source.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And it is something that lifts
us up to that higher vibration

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.900 align:middle line:84%
without bringing any pollution
or distortions into the energy

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:90%
And that part is key.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
While there are many stimuli we
could work with in this world,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them bring in pollution
or have become distorted

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.110 align:middle line:90%
by our improper use of them.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.880 align:middle line:84%
We want stimuli that enhance
our chakras and nervous system

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.060 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that we also
remain fully conscious

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and in control of
our thoughts, where

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.490 align:middle line:84%
we are fully present to how
that stimulus makes us feel

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and fully able to
consciously tune in

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and feel the influence
it's having on us.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Examples of stimuli that are
pure and of a high vibration

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
include things like therapeutic
grade essential oils, well

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:84%
composed music,
organic whole foods,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
healing energy from a
well-trained healer,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:90%
and things like this.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Whereas vibrations that can
come in and distort or bring

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:84%
pollution are things like drugs
and psychoactive substances,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, too much
caffeine, too much sugar,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
processed foods, too
much TV, people's drama,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and so forth,
especially commercials.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, we should be very
careful about the programming

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
that we allow to come
into us through the TV.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Some of these stimuli
may feel like they

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:84%
give a temporary
boost, but if they

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:84%
come with the price of a
deeper crash afterwards,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
or if they hook us
into addictive patterns

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.680 align:middle line:84%
or add stress on
the system, then

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
these are the things that
are not of a pure vibration.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.840 align:middle line:84%
What actually happens inside us
when we encounter a stimulus?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
As information or
energy comes in,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.180 align:middle line:84%
we detect it and receive
it through either the five

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
physical senses and
neurological system

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.360 align:middle line:84%
or through the five spiritual
senses and the biofield.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:84%
From the biofield,
it enters the body

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.310 align:middle line:84%
first through the
chakras, which connect

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to the endocrine
system, that then

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.650 align:middle line:84%
stimulates the nervous
system and the brain.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And we can think of these
five spiritual senses

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:84%
as the souls sensory
nervous system.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
These five physical and
five spiritual senses

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
are instruments of
detection and perception.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we take in a
stimulus, at first it's

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
received unconsciously,
meaning the energy comes in,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
but our conscious mind isn't
registering it right away.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So typically the first
stimulus triggers a feeling,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.480 align:middle line:90%
meaning a sensation in the body.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:84%
Examples of feelings
include temperature changes

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:84%
in the body, or sweaty palms, or
a change in our breathing rate.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Or our heart skips a beat, or
maybe the hairs on our arms

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
stand up, or the back
of the neck tingles.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Or we might feel a tension
somewhere in the body, maybe

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.500 align:middle line:90%
a lack of ease.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be an
uplifting feeling,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.420 align:middle line:84%
stimulating us in a positive
way like a feeling of elation.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
So by feeling here it means a
physical body sensation, not

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:90%
an emotion.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Most of our feelings
or sensations

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.130 align:middle line:84%
are being processed by
the old brain and brain

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
stem levels, the very deepest
parts within the brain.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's all happening
below the surface

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.890 align:middle line:90%
of our conscious awareness.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
It's happening unconsciously
for the most part.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
But this kicks off a process
within our neurological system

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
that moves from the deeper
brain and then triggers

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.050 align:middle line:90%
into the limbic brain.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And sitting just between the
old brain and the limbic system

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
are the pineal gland,
pituitary gland,

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%
and the hypothalamus glands.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.000 align:middle line:84%
These are the central
core or the master glands

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.960 align:middle line:90%
of the endocrine system.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:10%
A stimulus goes
through a circuit

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.460 align:middle line:10%
within our neural wiring
and these gateway glands,

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.090 align:middle line:10%
which then triggers a
biochemical cascade that

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:18.040 align:middle line:10%
then stimulates either an
emotional response or a desire.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.450 align:middle line:84%
If it's a desire,
well, those desires

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.210 align:middle line:84%
can be coming either from
the deeper brain body system,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
or they can also be coming
from the more conscious desires

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:90%
stored in the higher cortex.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
If it's an emotion, the
limbic system, the midbrain,

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
is what holds most of
our emotional memories.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So here we can also
define our emotions now.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
But let's define them,
instead of as a brain process,

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.080 align:middle line:84%
let's define them
as a form of energy.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And this form of energy
is one that our soul

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.790 align:middle line:90%
uses to communicate with us.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So our emotions are like
a language of our soul

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:90%
as it sends signals into us.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Often, an emotional response
has to do with whether or not

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:84%
our needs are being
taken care of.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
When our needs are not
being taken care of,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:90%
we tend to get more emotional.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:84%
We get hurt, we get
agitated, angry.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
But if our needs are being
taken care of, we feel happy,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we feel energized, we're
more romantic about life,

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and we might be
able to connect more

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
with other people
in a positive way.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:84%
If, however, our desires
are getting triggered,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.010 align:middle line:84%
our desires have to do with our
wants rather than our needs.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And they're all the things
that we want in life.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.640 align:middle line:84%
So wants and desires are going
to be driven more by the ego as

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.380 align:middle line:90%
opposed to the soul.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The ego is related to our
sense of our individual self,

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.960 align:middle line:84%
while emotions are more
related to the soul's growth.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.390 align:middle line:84%
So the desires of
the individual self

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
are not so much about
our physical needs

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
for survival but
all the other stuff

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:90%
that we want to experience.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Before we go too
far, let's clarify

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that the ego has both positive
and negative aspects to it.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We're not just talking about
the bad parts, which most people

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:90%
presume when they think of ego.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:84%
We have positive
desires that support

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
our growth and our well-being.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And we also have
negative desires

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.630 align:middle line:84%
that can be harmful or
damaging or based on addiction.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The key with desire
is to realizing

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:90%
where is it coming from.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it coming from
positive ego or is it

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:90%
coming from negative ego?

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.780 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference between
positive ego and negative ego?

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's begin with positive ego.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.700 align:middle line:84%
Our higher self
uses positive ego

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
to help us feel driven in life,
to explore and experience life,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
pursue our joy.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Our positive desires come
from that higher self

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
working through the positive
ego and the conscious mind.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But what we tend
to be conscious of

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:84%
is usually just that
tip of the iceberg.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And the negative ego,
on the other hand,

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is being driven by subconscious
programming, all the stuff

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.040 align:middle line:90%
below the surface of the water.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And so these are things
like our unresolved issues,

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
indoctrination, fears,
old traumas, self sabotage

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.930 align:middle line:84%
mechanisms,
insecurities, and so on.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And these things very
much tend to drive us.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
So until we gain a greater
level of mastery of ourselves,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.280 align:middle line:84%
we tend to be operating
more on that subconscious

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.820 align:middle line:84%
patterning of old, repressed,
addictive, and habitual

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.290 align:middle line:90%
ways of being.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Those deeper patterns
are the things

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.170 align:middle line:84%
we want to learn to
reprogram or eliminate.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:84%
They can create a
lot of distortions,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:84%
skewing how our
spirit, our true self,

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:47.280 align:middle line:84%
is able to express
through us into the world.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.420 align:middle line:84%
The negative ego is
the buried parts of us

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.560 align:middle line:84%
that haven't yet been healed or
haven't resolved and rectified

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.020 align:middle line:84%
We can consider the
ego itself as a whole

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
to be like a lens or
a vessel through which

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
that spirit or
that light flows in

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:90%
to express itself in the world.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine on this lens
that splotches or dark spots

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
will distort the light
as it flows through.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.860 align:middle line:84%
These are the areas
that represent

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.230 align:middle line:84%
where we need to
heal or clean up

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.890 align:middle line:84%
our filter of the negative
ego, whereas the areas that

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:84%
are clear and transparent,
allowing that light

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:84%
to flow through undistorted,
can be related more

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:90%
to the positive ego.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, we talk about
something called shattering.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.300 align:middle line:84%
We've all been through
certain traumatic experiences

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.580 align:middle line:84%
that have been shattering
to us in some degree.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And Kabbalah says that one
of our main jobs or purpose

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:84%
in life is to go through
what is known as Tikkun.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.310 align:middle line:84%
This is the process of
rectifying, healing,

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and repairing the
shattering of the vessels

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.080 align:middle line:84%
or this distortion of
our ego and our soul.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to transmute
the ego and the soul

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.470 align:middle line:84%
into more whole and
perfected states

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
so that life can flow
through us undistorted.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And we all need to repair
and heal at some level.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.640 align:middle line:84%
How do we start this
process of Tikkun

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
so that we can gain greater
mastery of ourselves

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:84%
and the way we
respond to stimuli?

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, one key is
to find balance.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Well, balance of what?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
It's a balance between
the desires of the ego

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.690 align:middle line:90%
and the needs of the soul.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine a teeter
totter or a set of scales

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.650 align:middle line:84%
where there's this fulcrum or
balance point in the middle.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.370 align:middle line:84%
On either side of the
center are two weights.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In the middle at
the fulcrum is where

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:84%
the stimuli come in and are felt
as physical body sensations.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.180 align:middle line:84%
How do we find balance
between these two sides?

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer that, let's
take a closer look at our

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%
wants versus our needs.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:84%
What are our basic
needs, meaning

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:07.290 align:middle line:84%
needs that we must
have for survival

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:90%
at a very physical level?

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, first and foremost,
we need to breathe.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:90%
We need air.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.100 align:middle line:84%
We also need things like water,
food, sunlight, and warmth,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:84%
which we can group together
under a single category

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:90%
that we call consumption.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
We're consuming energy
in some form or another.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.240 align:middle line:84%
These ways that we take
in and consume energy

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:84%
are essential to
sustaining life.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And when we have the proper
amount of that energy coming in

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
with pure vibrations, not only
do we sustain, we also thrive.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:84%
And that is what our
soul really yearns for.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
So with proper food,
rest, hydration, exercise,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and balance with
our environment,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.080 align:middle line:90%
we begin to thrive.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:84%
We have vitality, and we
feel physically uplifted.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
But if we're consuming energy,
what else do we need to do?

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:90%
Well, we need to eliminate.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And we eliminate through
our digestive system,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:84%
through the sweat, through
cutting out activities

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.800 align:middle line:90%
as needed, and resting.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.230 align:middle line:84%
In order to truly
thrive, we have

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
to find that balance between
consumption and elimination.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, stagnation
and toxic buildup

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
will accumulate and
lead us to disease.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:32.880 align:middle line:84%
So in all things, remember to
not just accumulate or hoard,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.140 align:middle line:84%
but to establish a
balanced flow in and out,

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:90%
consumption and elimination.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual traditions
all over the world

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:90%
know this really well.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
For example, they use fasting
to bring our systems back

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.590 align:middle line:84%
into balance on
a periodic basis.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So regular cleansing can
support our overall system

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to reduce stagnation and
toxicity within our body.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:03.150 align:middle line:10%
In addition to breathing,
consumption, and elimination,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:10%
the fourth and final thing
we need to survive and thrive

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.310 align:middle line:10%
is love.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.099 align:middle line:84%
As a baby, this love
comes through the touch,

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
the attention, the
nurturing of a caregiver.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
But as we get
older, that love can

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.300 align:middle line:84%
come through maybe
our relationships

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
with others, not necessarily
one particular person,

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.560 align:middle line:84%
but in general, having loving
relationships in our lives.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet even more
important is that we

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:33.283 align:middle line:84%
come from self-love and
divine love from source.

00:17:33.283 --> 00:17:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, the problem
here is that if we

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:39.420 align:middle line:84%
think we need a particular
person in our life,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
that mindset can lead
to a co-dependency.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
This is about having
love in our life,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
not as an emotion
or romantic feeling.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
that kind of love here.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.910 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about Agape
love, a force of creation.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And this energy or
force is all around us.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.260 align:middle line:84%
It's accessible to us, as long
as we're ready to receive it.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But to receive it, we
must love ourselves.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And also it helps to have a
sense of love or reverence

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:16.200 align:middle line:84%
towards spirit in order to feel
that presence of the divine.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:90%
It's always there for us.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So love is a need, but
it's the Agape love

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.640 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's really it, just
four needs, air, consumption,

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.090 align:middle line:90%
elimination, and love.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
These four categories of
needs have been scientifically

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.200 align:middle line:84%
proven as necessary for the
health of the physical body.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:90%
But that's all we really need.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Beyond that, everything else is
what we would call part of our

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:90%
wants category in life.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So what are wants
and desires in life?

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's pretty
much anything else

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.880 align:middle line:84%
we want, things like romance,
passion, leisure time,

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.090 align:middle line:84%
or certain lifestyle
choices, like preferring

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:00.450 align:middle line:84%
to eat a particular type
of food or a certain way.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It's OK to want these
things and have fun in life.

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:90%
That's part of why we're here.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.310 align:middle line:84%
And we can have our indulgences
but within moderation,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.700 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:84%
We can also want things
like greater meaning in life

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.805 align:middle line:84%
or a sense of
purpose, a calling.

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And one important
thing to realize

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.550 align:middle line:84%
when trying to get a
handle on all of this

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:84%
is that the things
that we're addicted to,

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.390 align:middle line:84%
these are also part of
our wants, not our needs.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And why this is important
is that if we tell ourselves

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that I need this or that in my
life, what we're subconsciously

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.910 align:middle line:84%
telling ourselves is that I have
to have it or I'm going to die.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.690 align:middle line:84%
Saying something is a
need when it's really not

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.420 align:middle line:84%
is one way that our
negative ego drives us

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
into addictive patterns, and
we give away our willpower

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:90%
to that thing.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So rather than calling
it a need, say, I'd like,

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:84%
or I'd prefer, or
I want to have it.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:90%
But don't call it a need.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.010 align:middle line:84%
As a really tangible
example, if I say,

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.930 align:middle line:84%
I need a drink, well, if I
mean water, then yeah, sure.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.450 align:middle line:90%
That is a need.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.610 align:middle line:84%
But if I mean alcohol or soda
or coffee or some sugar laden

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:90%
drink, then no, we really don't.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a want, not a need.

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
We must become aware of what we
are giving our power away to.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason for this
that we'll get to in a moment.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We start by observing
our languaging

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.170 align:middle line:84%
and how we say things
to ourselves and others.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.920 align:middle line:84%
By clarifying our
wants versus our needs,

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.080 align:middle line:84%
this is one way that we can
get control of this process.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, why should we pay
such close attention

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
towards our choice of words?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.120 align:middle line:90%
How does this really help us?

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, remember.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to balance out
the two sides of the teeter

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:90%
totter or the scales.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So if we have four
categories of needs,

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.530 align:middle line:84%
we should therefore figure
out four categories of wants.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And realize, this is
about how we use energy,

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
how we process a
stimulus and direct it

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.170 align:middle line:84%
with our thoughts, which
then drives our actions.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
If these two sides
are not balanced,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.730 align:middle line:84%
then like a teeter totter,
if we're heavy on the

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:84%
wants side of things,
then let's say

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:18.670 align:middle line:84%
we drop a ball in the center
point of that fulcrum.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it hits
that center point,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.930 align:middle line:84%
it's going to roll
downhill towards the wants.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is essentially
allowing the ego

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.280 align:middle line:84%
to grab the energy because
the ego relates to our wants.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So it grabs the energy, and it
takes that to feed its wants.

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But it often comes
at the expense

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.590 align:middle line:90%
of taking care of our needs.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
If our needs are not being
taken care of, what happens?

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, we become physically
depleted in some way.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
We might get sick or
go into survival mode.

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
This then becomes prime
time for the negative ego

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:90%
to just take over.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.830 align:middle line:84%
If we're in survival
mode, we're typically

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:01.030 align:middle line:84%
operating from the old brain's
fight or flight reactions.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Our old brain hijacks our
executive functioning,

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to run the show
from instinctual survival

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:84%
When that happens,
we are no longer

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:16.060 align:middle line:84%
in conscious choice or self
mastery by a far stretch.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we are now being
driven by our autopilot mode

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:90%
and our fears.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to
balance this out.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And we do that by
ensuring balance

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:90%
between our wants and our needs.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
That way, when the
energy comes in,

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.600 align:middle line:84%
it has a chance to
move towards fulfilling

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.800 align:middle line:84%
our needs and our soul in a
balanced rhythm with pursuing

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:90%
our wants and our desire.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
When we balance this, the energy
can then be directed properly.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
But if it's overloaded
on one side,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
it's like having a small child
on one side of the teeter

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.150 align:middle line:84%
totter with then a heavy
adult on the other side.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.300 align:middle line:90%
And it's not so fun.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.920 align:middle line:84%
It's harder to keep
the rhythm going.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not balanced.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Only through balance
between the two sides

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
does that teeter
totter back and forth

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
process become fun because
it keeps a good rhythm going.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:84%
How do we find that good balance
between our needs and our

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.580 align:middle line:90%
wants?

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.100 align:middle line:84%
One helpful tool is to
make a list of all of our

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:84%
wants, everything
we want in life,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.470 align:middle line:84%
including anything we might
have thought previously,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
we had called as a need
or we thought it was need.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:84%
But now we see that it doesn't
fall into one of those four

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
basic categories of needs.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So make this list
of all the wants.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:10%
Then once you have
that list of all

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.980 align:middle line:10%
your wants in life,
on each one of them,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:10%
rank them on a
scale of one to 10.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.620 align:middle line:84%
One means, I can
live without it.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.440 align:middle line:84%
It's nice, but I
can live without it.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.440 align:middle line:10%
10 means, I have to
have it, or life just

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:10%
doesn't seem meaningful
or worthwhile.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking for
here is to find four big

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.250 align:middle line:90%
wants that rank number 10.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.840 align:middle line:10%
Usually those wants are going to
be positive things like health

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:10%
and beautiful relationships,
expressing our creativity,

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:10%
having vitality, having a
joyful life, a sense of purpose,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:10%
surrounding ourselves
with activities and things

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.990 align:middle line:10%
that uplift us.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
These are all positive
thoughts and wants

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.423 align:middle line:90%
that come from the higher self.

00:24:26.423 --> 00:24:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is all part
of what we are here

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:32.230 align:middle line:84%
to express and experience
through the positive ego.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So find those four
big wants that balance

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.623 align:middle line:90%
out the four big needs.

00:24:37.623 --> 00:24:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do we do with
all those other things that

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:90%
didn't make our top four list?

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Well all those other wants that
are not ranking in number 10,

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.540 align:middle line:84%
we can label them now
into this other category.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:54.040 align:middle line:84%
We can still choose to engage in
those lesser wants, but realize

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
that when we do, we're directing
our energy away from fulfilling

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:90%
our greater wants and needs.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Where attention
goes, energy flows.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of saying that
is what we focus on expands.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a choice we make.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And when we realize how
we're directing our energy,

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
we can then better harness
it and discipline ourselves

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.660 align:middle line:84%
to consciously direct it towards
what we truly desire in life

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and what we need
to really thrive

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.840 align:middle line:84%
and to live the
life of our dreams.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
This dynamic between
our ego and our soul,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
our wants and our
needs, this is what

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:37.390 align:middle line:84%
determines then what thoughts
arise in our conscious mind.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Whether the ego gets triggered
with a desire or the soul

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.230 align:middle line:84%
gets triggered with an
emotion, after all of this,

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:84%
does it then finally lead to a
thought at a conscious level.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Here, the stimulus
now makes its way up

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
to the cerebral cortex, the
higher regions of the brain.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And we become aware
of the stimulus.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It then sweeps forward
to the prefrontal cortex,

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.560 align:middle line:90%
where we make a decision.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:84%
That thought and decision then
lead us to take an action.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:11.830 align:middle line:84%
The question is are we really
making a conscious decision,

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.130 align:middle line:84%
or are we running on autopilot
and taking actions just

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.810 align:middle line:90%
based on habit?

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:84%
When we're on autopilot,
the negative ego

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.270 align:middle line:84%
is what's predominantly running
the show with subconscious

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:90%
patterns and programming.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.660 align:middle line:84%
But when we self reflect and
we make those necessary changes

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.630 align:middle line:84%
in our lives to
balance things out,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:36.490 align:middle line:84%
we can strengthen our ability to
consciously choose our actions.

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.610 align:middle line:84%
We can have more discernment,
more self control, more self

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:44.470 align:middle line:84%
mastery, rather than operating
on autopilot or reaction.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Why is it important for us
to shift the cycle of thought

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.590 align:middle line:90%
and action?

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
This is because whatever action
we take then creates a ripple.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:10%
And it leads to some
kind of result that

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.830 align:middle line:10%
then feeds back into the cycle.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:84%
The actions we take can either
stimulate a positive feedback

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:90%
loop or a negative one.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:84%
In those times when we feel
like the universe is against us

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:13.330 align:middle line:84%
or we see ourselves as some kind
of a victim of circumstance,

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.580 align:middle line:84%
we should be really
asking ourselves,

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:84%
what have I been feeding into
the cycle of cause and effect?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:90%
Is this karma?

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
Is this a result of some
previous thoughts or actions

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
that I've been
putting out there?

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, maybe not, but the
important thing to realize here

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:34.090 align:middle line:84%
is that our thoughts can
generate karma too, not just

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:90%
our actions.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.580 align:middle line:90%
What does that really mean even?

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:84%
What it means is that thought
precedes action, but here's

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:90%
the kicker.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, all thought
will be acted upon.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.240 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we've all had
thoughts that we did not

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.040 align:middle line:90%
act upon ourselves.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So what happened
to that thought?

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.370 align:middle line:90%
Where did the energy go?

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We explored in season
one of Mystery Teachings

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:90%
that there is only one mind.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:84%
We're all connected through the
sea of universal consciousness.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.830 align:middle line:84%
We can consider thought
as a vibrational energy.

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:15.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not physical yet,
but it is just one layer

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:90%
above the physical.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a vibrational energy
that can be measured,

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.930 align:middle line:90%
and it influences things here.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Examples of how our
thoughts impact the physical

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:84%
can be demonstrated by
things like spoon bending

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:31.750 align:middle line:84%
or kinesiology and
various psy-phenomenon.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
We know that our thoughts
impact us internally for sure.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.570 align:middle line:84%
They can trigger either stress
or relaxation responses within.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.140 align:middle line:84%
For example, epigenetic
research by scientists

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.300 align:middle line:84%
like Bruce Lipton
and Dawson Church

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:84%
have shown that when we
regularly and authentically

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:84%
think positive and uplifting
thoughts towards ourselves,

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:84%
the epigenetic layers of
our DNA switch to expressing

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:90%
more of our genetic potential.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And our system then
functions better,

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:84%
whereas negative
thoughts suppress

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.330 align:middle line:90%
the genetic expression.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.540 align:middle line:84%
Negativity causes
stress, which can then

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.620 align:middle line:84%
trigger higher cortisol
production in the body.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And that affects
stomach acid levels,

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:84%
which affects digestion,
energy levels, mood,

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and a whole cascade
of other things.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.670 align:middle line:84%
These internal
environmental conditions

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.850 align:middle line:84%
within our body
triggered by our thoughts

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.360 align:middle line:84%
contribute to whether the
epigenetic switches of our DNA

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.530 align:middle line:90%
turn on or off.

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It's so important for our
own health and benefit

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that we learn to
control our thoughts.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.450 align:middle line:84%
What about the rest of
the world outside of us?

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, as the saying goes,
as the inner, so the outer.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts also
impact others because we

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
share one collective
field of mind,

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.260 align:middle line:90%
a collective consciousness.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts go out
into the collective

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and effect it for
better or for worse.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:84%
This is especially
true when we're

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.570 align:middle line:84%
talking about the thoughts that
we personally don't act upon.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, the energy
has to go somewhere.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.600 align:middle line:84%
Action is what grounds
the energy of thought.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And remember, I said
earlier, all thought

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:90%
is ultimately acted upon.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Consider the collective
field of mind

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:25.380 align:middle line:90%
to be like a cloud of energy.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.520 align:middle line:84%
In a storm, electrostatic
energy builds up.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.520 align:middle line:84%
There's an accumulation
of charged ions.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And this contributes to an
overall electrical charge

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.560 align:middle line:90%
in the cloud.

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.010 align:middle line:84%
At some point when it
reaches that critical level,

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:90%
it has to discharge.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:90%
And what do we get?

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.170 align:middle line:90%
We get lightning striking.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Lightning strikes,
seeking to ground

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:54.130 align:middle line:84%
the energy into the earth to
dissipate the excess charge.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.730 align:middle line:84%
This is a really good
analogy for what happens

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.160 align:middle line:90%
in the collective mind field.

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:04.060 align:middle line:84%
The more a thought is generated
and put out into the field,

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.240 align:middle line:84%
the more it is repeated,
the more emotional charge

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.800 align:middle line:90%
it has behind it.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And the more people
who are focusing

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.230 align:middle line:84%
on that kind of
energy or thought,

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.170 align:middle line:84%
the stronger that
charge becomes.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And it builds up this
energy in the collective.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.540 align:middle line:84%
At some point, when that charge
in the collective consciousness

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:29.220 align:middle line:84%
reaches a critical level, it
will seek a suitable grounding

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.480 align:middle line:84%
rod to discharge just
like lightning striking.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.510 align:middle line:84%
What grounding
rods, what are they?

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are the grounding rods.

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.330 align:middle line:84%
The energy will
find who ever it can

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.650 align:middle line:84%
that has a sympathetic affinity
with that particular vibration.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And it grounds
through them to then

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:84%
be acted upon, meaning
somebody will eventually

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.500 align:middle line:84%
act upon our thoughts,
expressing it

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.060 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.810 align:middle line:84%
The charge has to be
dissipated somehow.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:04.260 align:middle line:84%
So before we go pointing fingers
and blaming others or blaming

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.860 align:middle line:84%
society for all the ills of
this world, just remember,

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.310 align:middle line:90%
we are all one collective mind.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we are all
responsible for the thoughts

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:16.200 align:middle line:90%
we contribute to the whole.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.110 align:middle line:84%
There is also a
positive side to this.

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:23.460 align:middle line:84%
We can contribute positive
thoughts into the collective.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who want
to be the change,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.070 align:middle line:84%
who want to be conscious
contributors in a positive way,

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:84%
can and must take
personal responsibility

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.300 align:middle line:90%
to control our thoughts.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:84%
When we focus on sending
positive thoughts

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.580 align:middle line:84%
into the collective one
rather than negative ones,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.230 align:middle line:90%
we can help.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Taking responsibility
to clean up our mind

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and our actions
allows us to make

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.650 align:middle line:84%
more positive contributions
into that collective mind field.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Using practices like
meditation and rituals

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.830 align:middle line:84%
to quiet and direct
the mind with intention

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.550 align:middle line:90%
are really key here.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, what are some
constructive actions

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.800 align:middle line:84%
that we can take to help
redirect such negative energy?

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:90%
The key is to ground it.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if we get
triggered to something

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:12.860 align:middle line:84%
like anger, rather than
ruminating and repeating

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.380 align:middle line:84%
with imaginary
conversations in our head,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:19.280 align:middle line:84%
we can take action via some
kind of a physical outlet.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's go for a run
or a fast walk.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we can
punch a punching bag

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.560 align:middle line:84%
or go yell it out in the car
with the music just cranked up.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Right, we can then redirect
and ground this energy

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:84%
through all that
physical activity.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Another way is to
transmute it by calling

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:84%
in higher spiritual energy
through something like ritual.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Rituals are action oriented.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is important because
it's different from meditation.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Rituals are action oriented,
and they're designed

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.070 align:middle line:90%
to create a shift in energy.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So what are some examples
or practical things

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.800 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to help us gain
greater mastery of ourselves

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:84%
and how we contribute
to the collective field?

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.400 align:middle line:84%
In addition to the physical
activities already mentioned,

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:08.690 align:middle line:84%
one ritual is to write out our
thoughts on a piece of paper.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:10.400 align:middle line:90%
Get it all out of our system.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
And writing it
helps to ground it.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And when we do this, though,
be mindful that the goal

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:20.120 align:middle line:84%
is to dissipate the energy,
meaning to let it go.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.130 align:middle line:84%
If we hold onto it
or attach or get

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.050 align:middle line:84%
into the emotion
and the drama, that

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:90%
means we're not letting it go.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So we want to get it
out so that we can just

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.980 align:middle line:90%
let it go and ground it.

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And one option for helping us
to further release and transmute

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:84%
any negativity is to
then rip the pages up

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and burn them and watch the
flames burn it down to ash.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, we can do this
through a visualization process

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.179 align:middle line:90%
internally.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:49.100 align:middle line:84%
We can call in the
element of fire

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.280 align:middle line:84%
and visualize a
bonfire internally

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and put all those thoughts and
emotions and negative things

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:59.480 align:middle line:84%
into the fire and
let them burn away.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next tip
to take this a step

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.370 align:middle line:84%
further is once we
get into a space

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.530 align:middle line:84%
where we can think
more clearly, we now

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:10.270 align:middle line:84%
want to get conscious of where
is that energy coming from.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And to do so, we can ask
the following questions.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Where is this
energy coming from?

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.150 align:middle line:10%
Is this my ego?

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.720 align:middle line:10%
And if so, is it
positive or negative ego?

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:10%
Or is this my soul
communicating something to me?

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.110 align:middle line:10%
If it's an emotion,
is it current,

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.980 align:middle line:10%
and is it inappropriate measure
to the current situation?

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.590 align:middle line:10%
Or is this a regular
emotional pattern

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.860 align:middle line:10%
of mine, something
that I always go to?

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.740 align:middle line:10%
Is this triggering
something from my past?

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Is it revealing to me something
maybe that requires healing?

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:45.800 align:middle line:10%
Or is this something
that I really

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:10%
should be paying attention
to here and now in the people

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.190 align:middle line:10%
and in the
environment around me?

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Also, become aware of how the
stimulus is being perceived.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Is it coming in through
the internal senses

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.040 align:middle line:90%
or through the external senses?

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.310 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, whatever
the stimulus is,

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.280 align:middle line:84%
we can ask, what
would spirit do?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.930 align:middle line:90%
What would love do?

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:12.890 align:middle line:84%
What is higher will
trying to direct me to do?

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:17.150 align:middle line:84%
What would bring the most
positive outcome or impact?

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Asking these questions
helps us to make a more

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.700 align:middle line:90%
proactive and clear decision.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Rather than reacting from
negative ego and woundedness,

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:84%
we can align with our
spirit's higher will

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and do so consciously
and purposefully.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.800 align:middle line:84%
Take the actions that will lead
to the best possible outcome,

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.160 align:middle line:84%
and put positive
feedback into that cycle.

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.010 align:middle line:84%
This is how we really
get conscious and aware

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:46.430 align:middle line:84%
of the process of what is
happening within us as energy

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.890 align:middle line:90%
and vibration comes in.

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:52.520 align:middle line:84%
As we reflect on this, we can
get into a more conscious way

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.210 align:middle line:84%
of impacting our life and
then the ripple effects

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:90%
that we have on the world.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Always remember, the
world is our mirror.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:06.480 align:middle line:84%
By the fruits or by the
results we see outside of us,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.190 align:middle line:84%
we shall know what needs
to shift inside so that we

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.260 align:middle line:90%
can be the change.

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Change starts within.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:18.620 align:middle line:84%
By taking responsibility for
our thoughts, emotions, actions,

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.360 align:middle line:84%
by observing this
pattern within us,

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.740 align:middle line:84%
we can become powerful agents
of change within the collective.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:84%
As more of us commit
to doing this,

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:29.750 align:middle line:84%
we will create a shift
in the collective field

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.540 align:middle line:90%
and we'll transform our reality.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:84%
By bringing more light, more
love, kindness, harmony,

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.440 align:middle line:84%
and beauty, we can
shift from separation

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:44.750 align:middle line:84%
to a collective realization
that we are all one.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we discover
how to become more fully

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:90%
awakened as galactic beings.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.290 align:middle line:84%
