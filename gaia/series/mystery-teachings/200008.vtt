00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
and this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:10%
What stages do we go through
in our personal transformation

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.000 align:middle line:10%
process, and what are
the potential pitfalls we

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.490 align:middle line:10%
might encounter along the way?

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we explore
the alchemy of life,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:10%
and the seven stages
of transformation

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:10%
that are revealed to
us by the ancient art

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.860 align:middle line:10%
and science of alchemy.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.840 align:middle line:84%
When alchemy first
came into my life,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I was immersed in my PhD studies
in physics, and to begin with,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I had the stereotypical
bias that alchemy

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:90%
was an outdated pseudoscience.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I was skeptical, because
when I thought of alchemy,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I thought of a bunch of
medieval puffers and charlatans

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.530 align:middle line:90%
trying to turn lead into gold.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.600 align:middle line:90%
I thought, I'm a real scientist.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.420 align:middle line:84%
I have nothing to
learn from alchemy.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I was biased towards not
touching it or even giving it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.000 align:middle line:84%
the time of day, but
that's because it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
was how I'd been programmed
to view it by the slant

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
that it was given in
our history of science.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.430 align:middle line:84%
The historians and
scientists largely

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:84%
dismissed alchemy and gave
it this bad reputation.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.170 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't much of anything
with practical application

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.320 align:middle line:90%
that we could test or apply.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
This was frustrating to me
as an experimental scientist,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.750 align:middle line:84%
because if we want to
bring this forward,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:90%
we have to make it practical.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find the
keys to bridge this

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
into a more grounded state of
application and testability.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:90%
So what changed my perspective?

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.530 align:middle line:10%
My mom was at a used
bookstore in California,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.230 align:middle line:10%
and she liked to buy
books, but I was too busy

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:10%
with graduate school,
and I told her

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:10%
I don't have time to
read anything else,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:10%
so don't buy me any more books.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, there she is in
this used bookstore,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
and there is a clearance
table near the checkout line.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.419 align:middle line:84%
And then as she
went to check out,

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.390 align:middle line:84%
the book was screaming
my name at her,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
so she decided to trust
her guidance and buy it.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.200 align:middle line:84%
She had given me a book about
the Emerald Tablet, written

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:90%
by Dennis William Hauck.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And by this point, I'd been
experiencing too many signs

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
pointing me to alchemy, so
I put aside my reservations

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and decided I could keep an
open mind and read the book.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.810 align:middle line:84%
As I was reading it, I
realized very quickly

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.650 align:middle line:84%
that alchemy was not at all
what I was taught in school.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.990 align:middle line:84%
It was a treasure
trove of wisdom,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and it was exactly what I
was looking for as a way

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to bridge science
and spirituality

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.490 align:middle line:90%
on a practical level.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:90%
How does alchemy do that?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, first we have to recognize
the real history of alchemy.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is the grandparent
of modern science.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when all
scientists were alchemists,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:90%
and they were very spiritual.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:84%
They didn't separate
spirituality from science.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
When you think of
alchemy, what's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
the first thing
that comes to mind?

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Most people think of either
the Philosopher's Stone,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.620 align:middle line:84%
or turning lead into gold, or
the process of transformation

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and transmutation.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, I thought of
turning lead into gold.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And from our rational scientific
worldview at the time in 2000,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
every scientist knew this
wasn't possible, at least

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.190 align:middle line:90%
not for a human here on Earth.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.010 align:middle line:84%
But as I read more into
alchemy, what I realized

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:84%
was that Western alchemists were
using a metaphorical language,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and their writings were
coded in these metaphors.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
When you read them, if you
try to take them literally,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:90%
they sound crazy.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
But when you've been initiated
and had the oral teachings

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.320 align:middle line:84%
handed down, you
realize the metaphor

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and can begin to
decode the meaning.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:84%
If we take the idea of turning
lead into gold as a metaphor,

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:90%
what does it mean?

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:84%
The lead is about the
heaviness, the impurities,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%
the dross of our being.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
This is what we want to
transform and transmute

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.050 align:middle line:84%
into the gold, which represents
perfection, incorruptibility,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:90%
and the beauty within.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.090 align:middle line:84%
Turning lead into gold
on a metaphorical level

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is about turning our
corruptible state

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
into an incorruptible
state and coming

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
into a more perfected
state of being.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we look at
it more literally,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.580 align:middle line:84%
there are those who claim
it's possible to turn lead

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.350 align:middle line:90%
into gold.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
In India and in the West, people
have done public demonstrations

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.130 align:middle line:90%
of such transmutations.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Even from a scientific
perspective, it's possible.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It happens every
day in the cosmos

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:84%
as stars go through their death
process and become supernovas.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
This is how all of the heavier
elements in the universe

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.980 align:middle line:90%
are generated.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.470 align:middle line:10%
And in this process,
we move all the way

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:10%
up the periodic chart
from hydrogen and helium

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:10%
to everything else.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
All of the heavier
elements only come in

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.790 align:middle line:90%
because of these supernovas.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
This is cosmic alchemy,
like the Phoenix

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
rising from its own ashes.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:90%
So yes, it's possible.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
But the question is, is
it possible to create

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.080 align:middle line:84%
that amount of fusion with
an Earth-based system?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Research has been done using
particle accelerators in 1981

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and they succeeded
in producing gold

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.230 align:middle line:84%
from lower elements
like bismuth.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Bismuth is just adjacent to
lead on the periodic table,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and they said that the same
process would work for lead.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just more difficult.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So is it possible that the
ancient alchemists actually

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.110 align:middle line:90%
did turn lead into gold?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
The jury is still out
on that one, I think,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.720 align:middle line:84%
but we know it's
physically possible,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.362 align:middle line:84%
and the key is in how
we harness energy.

00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:11.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, traditional
scientists are doing it

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:84%
based on pure material
physics, but they're

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.740 align:middle line:84%
leaving out alchemy and the
ability of consciousness

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.930 align:middle line:90%
to impact the quantum field.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.820 align:middle line:84%
In order to truly
be an alchemist who

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.160 align:middle line:84%
can harness the
quantum field, we'd

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.900 align:middle line:84%
have to become the Philosopher's
Stone within ourselves.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.410 align:middle line:10%
Hermes Trismegistus,
the Thrice-Great Hermes,

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:38.140 align:middle line:10%
received this name
because he mastered

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:43.180 align:middle line:10%
the three levels of his
being, body, soul, and spirit.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.280 align:middle line:10%
And to do so, he mastered the
three philosophies, or the arts

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:10%
and sciences of metaphysics.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
These are alchemy,
astrology, and theurgia.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's possible,
but the alchemists

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
had a very different mindset
than today's scientists.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They understood nature and
recognized that the three

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.120 align:middle line:90%
essentials are in everything.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
In their metaphorical
language, they called them

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:90%
salt, sulfur, and mercury.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
These represent body, soul,
and spirit, with consciousness

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:middle line:90%
being part of soul.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
They paid attention to
the alchemical process

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
to harness
consciousness and then

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
bring this into the equation.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Alchemists understood
that the pure essence,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:84%
the original divine blueprint,
is within everything.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But here, in its
raw physical state,

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.740 align:middle line:84%
it's corrupted in a way
that dampens the potential.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to do is
eliminate the impurities

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to transform and transmute that
raw material into its highest

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:90%
potential.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.870 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing
in this process is

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:84%
infusing more of
that divine spark,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
more of the spiritual
energy and consciousness

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:90%
into the physical materia.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.140 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists of
old observed nature,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:10.055 align:middle line:84%
experimented, and rediscovered
the formula for how to do this.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:12.130 align:middle line:84%
The most basic version
of this formula

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
is solve et coagula, which
is Latin for dissolve

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and coagulate, or
separate and recombine.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.530 align:middle line:84%
As I was reading that first
book on the Emerald Tablet,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I learned about the seven
stages of transformation,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and I could immediately
see how this

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:90%
was happening in my own life.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.210 align:middle line:84%
I'd started to prioritize
my spiritual development

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.309 align:middle line:84%
at that time, and
was experiencing

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
a process of transformation as
a result. The more I studied,

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
the more I realized
there's a natural flow

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.270 align:middle line:84%
to this alchemical
process that's universal.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It applies to our
lives just as much

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:84%
as it applies to chemistry,
medicine, and science.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
But getting through all seven
stages is not a guarantee.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.990 align:middle line:90%
We have to work for it.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:84%
As we go through
the process, there

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:84%
are some places
we can get stuck.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't make it all
the way through, we backslide.

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We go back and repeat the
early phases again and again

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.900 align:middle line:84%
until we dig in
and break through.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Let's dive in to explore
what these stages are,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.180 align:middle line:90%
and how not to get stuck.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, these seven
stages are traditionally

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.460 align:middle line:84%
called calcination, dissolution,
separation, conjunction,

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.780 align:middle line:84%
fermentation, distillation,
and coagulation.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
What in the world
do these terms mean?

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, in their
original essence, they

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
relate to chemical or
physical processes,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:84%
but they can also
apply to our own life

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and to the various
stages that we go through

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.170 align:middle line:90%
in our transformational journey.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore each of these
and what they mean for us.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.150 align:middle line:84%
How does this alchemical
process start?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, it starts with a catalyst.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Think of a time in your
life when you experienced

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
a really upsetting event.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.180 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
the loss of a job,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:84%
or a big breakup, or
a traumatic accident.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.677 align:middle line:84%
Something that really shook
the foundation of your life.

00:10:16.677 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
It could even have been
as simple as someone

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:84%
just offending you, and
you got flared up and angry

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:90%
from the insult.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.320 align:middle line:84%
This kind of occurrence
becomes, potentially,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.830 align:middle line:90%
the first step of calcination.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.860 align:middle line:84%
In the moment, it
feels very upsetting.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:84%
We feel burned by it,
like a fire just blazed

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:84%
through our life,
or an earthquake

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.860 align:middle line:90%
shook things into disarray.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
But when we move
through it, we can

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:84%
look back on that
time in our life

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and see that it was actually
a catalyst for transformation.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.530 align:middle line:84%
It's hard going through
it, but in the end,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:84%
we come out stronger
because of it

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
so long as we don't get
stuck in victimhood.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Through facing
such challenges, we

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.100 align:middle line:84%
come to know ourselves, our
gifts and our inner resources,

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:90%
more deeply.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.580 align:middle line:84%
This is because the
alchemical process

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.460 align:middle line:90%
is happening in our life.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.370 align:middle line:84%
This first step of alchemy,
the calcination stage,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.910 align:middle line:90%
is a burning and breaking down.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.650 align:middle line:84%
In the physical
process of alchemy,

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:24.800 align:middle line:84%
for example, a raw herb
is harvested from nature

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.410 align:middle line:90%
and then dried.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:31.060 align:middle line:84%
From there, the first thing
we do to it is pulverize it.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We pound it and grind
it with a mortar

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and pestle until it
becomes this fine powder.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:90%
Its old form is destroyed.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It's like a death or
loss of what once was.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And as if that isn't enough,
at some point we might also

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
light it on fire and burn
it down to ash or salt.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a very intense
process that completely

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%
destroys the old form.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing gentle
or comforting about it.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning
of separating out

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
the essential pieces
within that raw materia.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, there is
a saying that goes

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:90%
"all things transform by fire."

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And Paracelsus, the 15th century
alchemist and grandfather

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:84%
of modern pharmacology,
said "first

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and chiefly, the principal
subject of this art is fire.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:34.170 align:middle line:84%
It possesses a state
and power of vivifying.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:84%
The furnace and the fire
may be compared to the sun.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
It heats the furnace
and the vessels,

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
just as the sun heats
the vast universe.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.860 align:middle line:10%
For as nothing can be produced
in the world without the sun,

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:10%
so also in this art,
nothing can be produced

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.800 align:middle line:10%
without this simple fire.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:84%
No operation can be
completed without it.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Is the Great
Arcanum of the art."

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:84%
Fire is thus the
initiating and driving

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:84%
force that moves the
alchemical process forward.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
But why do we start with fire?

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's be honest
with ourselves.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.670 align:middle line:84%
It usually takes this kind
of burning to move us out

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:90%
of our comfort zone.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Without it, we
often get complacent

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:90%
or into a certain inertia.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.420 align:middle line:10%
Most people tend to
stay there until life

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:34.490 align:middle line:10%
sends these events that burn
and shake their foundation.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:39.433 align:middle line:84%
Once the fire comes along, we
start to move and transform.

00:13:39.433 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
The alchemist approaches
life with the understanding

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that evolution is
the flow of nature,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and that to continue
to progress and improve

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.720 align:middle line:90%
is the will of the divine.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
Even though we see
entropy in the world,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
there's really a general
movement towards order.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
There's a natural order to
things, and it's systematic.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.550 align:middle line:84%
We could say the mechanism for
this progression is alchemy.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And as we come to understand
what that mechanism is,

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:90%
we can harness it.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.990 align:middle line:84%
We can learn to work with
it, and more proactively

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
live the alchemy of life
rather than passively

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.590 align:middle line:90%
allowing it to happen to us.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.630 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, it starts by willingly
walking into the fire

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:28.490 align:middle line:84%
rather than running
away from it.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.180 align:middle line:84%
We push ourselves out
of the comfort zone

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and embrace opportunities
to grow and transform.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the
danger is not the fire.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.620 align:middle line:84%
It's what happens if
we avoid the fire.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.040 align:middle line:84%
If we run away
from the challenge,

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:84%
or avoid dealing
with it or shut down,

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.510 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to progress.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.850 align:middle line:84%
The thing about
fire is that we need

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to control it.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Fire can be destructive
if it's not controlled,

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.560 align:middle line:84%
but if we don't
have enough fire,

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.740 align:middle line:84%
it will lead to stagnation,
apathy, and depression.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.080 align:middle line:84%
If there's too much, it leads
to anger and destruction.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.300 align:middle line:84%
Part of our work
as an alchemist is

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to control it while
recognizing its power to burn.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.410 align:middle line:90%
We have to respect the fire.

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Once are willing to face the
fire and move through it,

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.640 align:middle line:90%
what comes next?

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.045 align:middle line:84%
Well, think about what happens
when our ego gets burned,

00:15:30.045 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
or we have a really
upsetting event.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.270 align:middle line:90%
What tends to happen next?

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:90%
Emotion.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:90%
Our emotions get stirred up.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.680 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to the
second stage of dissolution.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Now dissolution on
a physical level

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
is when we dissolve something
in water or some other liquid.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.690 align:middle line:10%
And whatever is left over from
that calcination stage, that

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:58.640 align:middle line:10%
pulverized materia or powdery
ash, is now put into a liquid

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.710 align:middle line:10%
and dissolved.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Metaphorically, water tends
to relate to our emotions.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Here, our emotions begin to
rise up from the subconscious

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.970 align:middle line:90%
into our awareness.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.650 align:middle line:84%
We feel them, we express
them, and we may even

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:90%
have a good cry.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.360 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing like
a good cry to soothe

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.600 align:middle line:90%
the burn after the calcination.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But in this stage,
things are murky,

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:90%
and it's hard to get clarity.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the worst things
we can do in this stage

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.120 align:middle line:84%
is try to make decisions when
we're in the throes of emotion.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do that, and
it creates unnecessary drama

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.940 align:middle line:90%
in their lives.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So here we need to stay
self-aware and learn

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.760 align:middle line:90%
some emotional control.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
We must recognize when we're
upset and not thinking clearly,

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and then remind
ourselves this is not

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.370 align:middle line:90%
the time to make any decisions.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So how do we move through
this stage more smoothly?

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, by finding an
appropriate outlet

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:90%
for this emotional energy.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.619 align:middle line:84%
We want to release it and let
it flow rather than holding it

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:84%
back, but water or
emotion can also

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:84%
be destructive if it's not
controlled and redirected.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So whatever outlet
we use, it needs

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
to be the appropriate outlet
and not directed at anyone.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Some examples include
journaling, or exercising it

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
off, or having a good cry with
a friend, or talking to someone

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
you trust to get
it off your chest.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.560 align:middle line:90%
But be careful here.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to come from
a place of complaining.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Rather, we're simply
expressing how

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:47.730 align:middle line:84%
we feel so that we can discharge
the energy in a healthy way.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to move past
any anger or sadness

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.566 align:middle line:84%
and go deeper to figure out
what's really underneath it.

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the pitfalls
here would be

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
to get stuck in
the emotional drama

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:84%
and playing the
part of the victim.

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
If we stay in that
emotional state,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.180 align:middle line:90%
we don't move through it.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to get
really self-reflective here.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.800 align:middle line:84%
As alchemists, we want
to learn how to move

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.640 align:middle line:90%
through these stages faster.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens as we start
delving into this watery phase?

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.780 align:middle line:84%
It starts to draw
our core essence out

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.240 align:middle line:90%
away from any impurities.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:90%
It's a very cleansing process.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Dissolution is a purifying step.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We're not separating
out what yet,

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:40.440 align:middle line:84%
but we are starting to
draw out what's essential.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And once we really let
the emotion pass through,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.520 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like what happens
after you have a good cry.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.020 align:middle line:84%
You get to the point
where you don't

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.590 align:middle line:90%
have any more tears to shed.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
The emotions pass or dissipate,
and we feel ready to move on.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, after the storm
passes, and the mind

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
becomes more clear
and calm, here we

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
can get the clarity of what
we need to really figure out

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.720 align:middle line:90%
what's what.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the transition to the
third stage called separation.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.820 align:middle line:84%
The separation stage is when
things have had enough time

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to sit and settle
down, and as it does,

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
the essences that were
extracted from the old form

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
are now more free
to separate out.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
At a physical level, we would
allow our dissolved solution

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:90%
to sit for a while undisturbed.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that
the lighter essences

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.730 align:middle line:84%
rise to the top while the
denser ones sink to the bottom.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.050 align:middle line:84%
Think about what happens when
we brew a loose leaf tea.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
First, the color and fragrance
gets extracted into the water.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:84%
Then, after it has
brewed long enough,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle line:84%
the tea leaves sink to
the bottom of the cup.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And if we let it sit for a
while without disturbing it,

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
an oily film would
even form on the top.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We can then spoon off
the oil to separate it

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.280 align:middle line:90%
into its own vessel.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Next, we'd pour what
remains through a filter,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and the liquid
essence passes through

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:84%
while the more dense materia
gets caught in the filter.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Through this process
we're separating the three

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:90%
essentials.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Then in alchemy, we take
each of these essentials

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
through further
purification to bring them

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
into their most purified state
before then later recombining

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:84%
How this relates
to our process is

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that we start to realize the
underlying connections that

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:90%
were triggered by this event.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
For example, perhaps
this event reminded us

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.580 align:middle line:84%
of some trauma that
happened in our past,

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's part of
why we got so upset.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.830 align:middle line:84%
It hit on a time when we felt
unloved or hurt, perhaps,

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and it brought something up
that hasn't fully healed.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And when we get clear on
why we felt the way we did,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:84%
we identify the fear
that we're facing,

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.550 align:middle line:84%
or a belief that we have
about ourselves or the world,

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and we become aware of
our emotional attachments

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.470 align:middle line:84%
and start to realize what's
really going on within us.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And now that we can see
it all more clearly,

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.530 align:middle line:84%
we can ask ourselves,
what do I want to keep?

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:23.070 align:middle line:90%
And what do I need to let go of?

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
What isn't working that led to
this event in the first place?

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.810 align:middle line:84%
We realize that the event
was just a catalyst,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and we start to see the
impurities within ourselves

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
that are corrupting
our life, our mind,

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:90%
and our relationships.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Here we get clear on
what we need to clean up.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And now we come to a
clear frame of mind,

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:84%
allowing for better
introspection

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:90%
and decision-making.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But it requires that
we tell ourselves

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
the truth about ourselves
rather than making it only

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:90%
about the outside situation.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes at this
stage we also realize

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.885 align:middle line:84%
that our old behaviors were
tied to certain social groups.

00:22:04.885 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we start to clean
things up for ourselves,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.340 align:middle line:84%
we may need to
make some changes.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
We might find that we're having
a hard time relating to some

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:90%
of those old friendships.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Maybe some of those
friends even try

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:84%
to re-engage us in the
old unhealthy patterns,

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.660 align:middle line:84%
because it's just what
we always did together.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So there comes a
point on our journey

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
where we might find
we need to separate

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.660 align:middle line:84%
from old relationships that
aren't matching us anymore.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's time to
break free and just focus

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:90%
on our growth and healing.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.960 align:middle line:84%
We need to give ourselves
time to figure out who we are

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:47.204 align:middle line:84%
and stabilize our new
identity and our way of life.

00:22:47.204 --> 00:22:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, where we can get
stuck at this stage

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:53.600 align:middle line:84%
is if we're holding on
to those old attachments.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.570 align:middle line:84%
There may be certain things
that aren't serving us,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.290 align:middle line:84%
but we hold on to them
because it's what's familiar.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:84%
We know it's not good for
us, but it's what we know,

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.190 align:middle line:90%
and we're afraid to let it go.

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.620 align:middle line:84%
This could apply to addictive
patterns, relationships,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:84%
career, or anything our
former self identity

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:90%
was wrapped up in.

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:84%
In time, as we continue
to grow in new directions,

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
we'll feel less connected to or
fulfilled by those old things.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And only when we let
go of the old can

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:32.550 align:middle line:90%
we create room for the new.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And this stage might feel
isolating or lonely at times,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:84%
but it's an act
of self-love to do

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.530 align:middle line:84%
the healing we need
to do for ourselves

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.110 align:middle line:90%
and figure ourselves out.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.530 align:middle line:84%
The alchemy is driving
us, and we know inside

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.465 align:middle line:90%
that this is what we need to do.

00:23:49.465 --> 00:23:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:57.030 align:middle line:84%
After we let go, how do
we move forward from here?

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.500 align:middle line:84%
This brings us to the
fourth stage of conjunction.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Finally, we've reached a really
nice part in the journey.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Letting go the old
actually brings us

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:90%
a sense of liberation.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like a weight
has been lifted,

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:84%
and we're starting to
feel good about ourselves

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.900 align:middle line:90%
and our situation again.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We've rediscovered aspects of
our deeper self, our strengths

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:90%
and core qualities.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.000 align:middle line:84%
We're learning more
about ourselves

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.880 align:middle line:84%
and getting in touch
with who we truly are.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.730 align:middle line:84%
We recognize both our
gifts and our liabilities.

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.940 align:middle line:84%
We have a deeper
connection with ourself,

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.020 align:middle line:84%
and now we can bring all these
essential pieces back together

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.580 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We're stabilizing in a whole new
frequency and pattern for life,

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.160 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to draw to
us new people who resonate

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:90%
at that same wavelength.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.940 align:middle line:84%
We know we're not at
our full potential yet,

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.180 align:middle line:84%
but we're starting to
see some glimpses of it,

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and this encourages us to
continue forward and keep

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.550 align:middle line:84%
on track so that we can
reach our greater potential.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This rejoining of the
now-purified essences

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.440 align:middle line:84%
into a more harmonious whole
is what conjunction means.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:84%
But as we bring the
pieces back together,

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.290 align:middle line:84%
we do so in a
measured way, making

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:21.740 align:middle line:84%
sure each essence is in
perfect proportion and harmony

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to the others.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, in physical alchemy, this
stage often creates a tincture,

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's at a higher vibration
than just a simple extraction.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
That's because everything has
been purified before bringing

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.746 align:middle line:90%
it back together.

00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing
about conjunction is

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.130 align:middle line:84%
that it's a nice stage to
be in, so the trap we need

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.080 align:middle line:84%
to watch out for
here is to not get

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:90%
too comfortable at this stage.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We're only at the midpoint
of the alchemical process.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not complete yet.

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.540 align:middle line:84%
If we stop here,
we stagnate again,

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.000 align:middle line:84%
and then we
backslide, and then we

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.950 align:middle line:84%
have to go through
the first four stages

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:08.170 align:middle line:84%
again and again until we
dig in and push forward.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.370 align:middle line:84%
When people aren't conscious of
their transformational journey

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
the proper guidance,

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.850 align:middle line:90%
it's easy to get stuck here.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.850 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens if you're
letting the alchemy just happen

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.710 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
An alchemist of life takes a
more proactive approach here

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.760 align:middle line:84%
by devoting themselves to
the great work of reaching

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.595 align:middle line:90%
their full potential.

00:26:30.595 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we want to keep going
through the final stages,

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:37.030 align:middle line:90%
it takes a bit of push.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Next, we move into the
fermentation stage.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.840 align:middle line:84%
This is both a deeper
purification process as well as

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.300 align:middle line:90%
a maturing process.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Basically, anything
remaining that is corruptible

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:90%
needs to die here.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.340 align:middle line:84%
In the physical
operations of alchemy,

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.240 align:middle line:84%
we would introduce a
low heat or inner fire

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
that keeps that transformational
process moving forward.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're addressing
impurities on a much more

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:09.250 align:middle line:84%
subtle level, and it
takes longer and requires

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:90%
both patience and persistence.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.810 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's
still corruptible

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.440 align:middle line:84%
that's not in its
purest essence will die.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And as it does, it
releases the spirit.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.370 align:middle line:84%
That's why alcohol has
been called spirits,

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
because it's one of
the essentials that

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:30.330 align:middle line:90%
gets released by fermentation.

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, at a personal
level, this is

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
when we're not
quite sure what we

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.430 align:middle line:84%
need to be doing at this
stage, and perhaps we're

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.920 align:middle line:84%
even fighting
ourselves, but we still

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:84%
feel the inner fires of
devotion moving us onward.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming more aware of
the deeper attachments that

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.880 align:middle line:84%
were once hidden,
and we're struggling

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:90%
to let go of them here.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.770 align:middle line:84%
The more we resist,
the more likely

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
it is that we might experience
a dark night of the soul.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Here, we must face our inner
darkness, the inner demons

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.660 align:middle line:90%
that we still struggle with.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.780 align:middle line:84%
These are more deeply-rooted
aspects of our ego

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:84%
and personality that hold
us back, some of which

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
we might have even thought
were positive at one point.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they
were, but now we've

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.580 align:middle line:84%
reached a threshold where
they're limiting our growth,

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.410 align:middle line:90%
so they have to go.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.740 align:middle line:84%
This stage thus involves
a death of the personality

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and any attachments
to our old identity.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a real fear
that comes up here,

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know who we're going

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.860 align:middle line:90%
to be without those things.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:43.430 align:middle line:84%
We might still think that
they're helping us in some way,

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:84%
but if they're
not really serving

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:50.510 align:middle line:84%
our next level of progression,
then it's time to let them go.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.570 align:middle line:84%
They're somehow limiting
the full embodiment

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.010 align:middle line:90%
of our divinity.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:59.090 align:middle line:84%
And because of this,
it's like a death,

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:02.890 align:middle line:84%
and there's some grief that
can come at this stage,

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.070 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't have
to be miserable.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It's really a matter
of what we do with it.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.950 align:middle line:84%
The more we work with it rather
than fighting against it,

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:15.570 align:middle line:90%
the faster it will go.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.940 align:middle line:84%
What else can we do to get
ourselves through this stage?

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, in ancient
times, initiates

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.230 align:middle line:10%
would move through
this phase faster

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.780 align:middle line:10%
by going on a vision quest.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.540 align:middle line:84%
In this process, they
might suppress their senses

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
to open up the mind
to an inward journey.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, they'd immerse
themselves in a dark cave,

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.380 align:middle line:84%
or they'd isolate
themselves in the desert

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.630 align:middle line:90%
for 40 days and nights.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:84%
They'd fast and bring
their body to stillness

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to enter into deep
meditative states,

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and it was a prolonged inward
process of deep meditation

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and cutting off all
the outer distractions.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And by willfully removing
the outside stimulation,

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.330 align:middle line:84%
it frees the soul
from its bondage

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to the physical matrix
and the old identity.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Another method that alchemists
used to speed up the process

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:14.910 align:middle line:84%
is they would focus intensely
on certain alchemical symbolism.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:84%
We find this extensively
in both Western alchemy

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:84%
and Tibetan
kalachakra traditions.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, initiates would
meditate on these images

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.880 align:middle line:84%
to invoke the
transformational fire

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and keep moving forward
towards higher energies.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.730 align:middle line:84%
They'd incorporate
breath work and chant

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.840 align:middle line:84%
to deeply connect between the
inner self and the divine.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And they'd continue
this devotional process

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:84%
until eventually a vision
would come upon them.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.980 align:middle line:84%
To truly make it through
this stage successfully,

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.480 align:middle line:84%
though, this vision
was something

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.810 align:middle line:84%
that the initiates needed
to earn on their own

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than inducing it
through ingesting anything.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:84%
They had to learn how
to open up the door

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.300 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual
realms themselves.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.040 align:middle line:84%
This is about
consciously working

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.200 align:middle line:84%
through the death
of the old self,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.590 align:middle line:84%
conquering our own inner demons,
and submitting to a higher

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.230 align:middle line:90%
will of our divine self.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
The inner alchemy happens
through breath work,

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.890 align:middle line:84%
meditation, harnessing
the innate life force

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:20.370 align:middle line:84%
energy to then raise
our vibration up,

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:90%
transcending from ego to spirit.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:84%
And through this, we come
to a point of true awakening

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and enlightenment.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And when the vision comes, it's
usually very colorful and full

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.880 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's very real.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And in alchemy, they call that
visionary moment the peacock's

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.050 align:middle line:84%
tail or the yellow
phase, and that's

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.200 align:middle line:84%
because of the colors
that come with it.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.980 align:middle line:84%
In laboratory alchemy, when
the fermentation is complete

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and all that remains
is essential,

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.440 align:middle line:84%
the peacock's tail is
literally a rainbowy film

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that forms on the
top of the ferment.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes it looks like
a yellow golden waxy film.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.390 align:middle line:84%
The fermentation process
requires a lot more personal

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:90%
effort and focus.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:84%
We apply our will,
and we get through it

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:14.820 align:middle line:84%
with patience,
discipline, and devotion.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Once we reach completion and
all the corruptible aspects

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.150 align:middle line:84%
are eliminated, we are
then ready to enter

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:90%
the next stage of distillation.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.960 align:middle line:84%
From here forward, only
the pure essence remains.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, once everything
that remains

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.710 align:middle line:84%
is pure what more
is there to do?

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to refine and raise
vibration, bringing things

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.580 align:middle line:90%
to their highest state.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.570 align:middle line:84%
Distillation involves bringing
the essentials into a solution

00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:90%
and then slowly applying heat.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The more volatile essences
will evaporate first,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and in their vapor state,
the Emerald Tablet of Hermes

00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:01.900 align:middle line:84%
says "it ascends from
Earth to heaven."

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:84%
As they do, they become more
receptive to the influence

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
of subtle energies, such
as astrological alignments

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.430 align:middle line:84%
or the intent and
energy that we send it.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:16.540 align:middle line:84%
Then we can capture that essence
into a separate vessel that's

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.350 align:middle line:84%
cooler and causes that essence
to now recondense into liquid.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And as it does, it brings that
subtle energy back with it

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.612 align:middle line:84%
into the denser form
of the physical.

00:33:28.612 --> 00:33:30.070 align:middle line:10%
And here's where
the Emerald Tablet

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:33.640 align:middle line:10%
says "and it again
descends to Earth,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:39.190 align:middle line:10%
and revives the strength of the
superiors and the inferiors."

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:42.390 align:middle line:84%
We take this through several
rounds of distillation,

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and every time it distills
into that vapor state,

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.450 align:middle line:84%
the solution is infused with
spirit and consciousness.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.920 align:middle line:90%
The energy imbues it.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And then as it recondenses, it
draws that higher vibrational

00:33:55.210 --> 00:34:00.106 align:middle line:84%
essence down to be
embodied in the physical.

00:34:00.106 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, what might this
distillation process

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.512 align:middle line:90%
look like for us?

00:34:04.512 --> 00:34:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, it involves
ongoing meditations

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:11.929 align:middle line:84%
to rise up from the lower mind
into quantum consciousness.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:84%
We come into a
coherent state where

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.960 align:middle line:84%
we're connected to
the mind of the all

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.929 align:middle line:90%
and receive illumination.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But we're not just hanging out
in this high vibrational level,

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:26.889 align:middle line:84%
we're rising up to be
filled with that light,

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and then we're recondensing
it, so to speak.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.400 align:middle line:84%
We bring these high
vibrational frequencies down

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.679 align:middle line:84%
into our lives to be
applied, meaning we live it.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:42.010 align:middle line:84%
And as we do, we manifest
the light into the physical.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Through application,
we learn and we grow,

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.710 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to recreate
our life according

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.820 align:middle line:90%
to this new vibration.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.510 align:middle line:90%
So it becomes a way of life.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:58.820 align:middle line:84%
A distillation brings the pure
essence into a mature state

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.930 align:middle line:84%
so that it can be perfected
and refined within us.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
This is a maturing process,
and it takes time, patience,

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.960 align:middle line:90%
and repetition.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:84%
We go through many
rounds of distillation

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.780 align:middle line:84%
before we get to the final
stage of this process.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:84%
That final step is
called coagulation.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It means to crystallize.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Here, the perfection of
the work is attained.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.700 align:middle line:84%
This is where all those
stories of turning lead

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
into gold or the
Philosopher's Stone come from.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the true mastery of the
three essentials, body, soul,

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.440 align:middle line:84%
It is the completion of the
great work of merging the three

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.870 align:middle line:90%
into one body of light.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Some call it the rainbow
body or the ascension body.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.270 align:middle line:84%
It's the perfection of the self,
transcending death and even

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.550 align:middle line:90%
achieving immortality.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:59.120 align:middle line:84%
But even when a person achieves
such a state, they're not done.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.540 align:middle line:84%
We're on an
ever-evolving journey

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.290 align:middle line:84%
to become fully realized
in our divine potential.

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It's an infinite journey, always
moving on to the next level.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment is not an
ending, it's a beginning.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy is a cyclic spiral ever
taking us onwards and upwards.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.478 align:middle line:84%
Why should we pay attention to
these seven stages of alchemy?

00:36:24.478 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing,
we want to start

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.960 align:middle line:84%
getting all the way through
them rather than getting

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.780 align:middle line:90%
stuck and backsliding.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Plus, they give us a map
that guides our process.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.220 align:middle line:10%
When we know what they
are, we can more easily

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.770 align:middle line:10%
identify where
we're at in our life

00:36:41.770 --> 00:36:44.710 align:middle line:10%
and how to move
forward from there.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the purpose
is to raise our vibration

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.840 align:middle line:84%
to the highest
spiritual potential

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.910 align:middle line:84%
and then bring that
highest potential back

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.560 align:middle line:90%
into the physical.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.250 align:middle line:84%
This is how we unite
above and below.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.640 align:middle line:84%
And as Hermes said toward the
end of the Emerald Tablet,

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.270 align:middle line:84%
"so thou has the glory
of the whole world.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.195 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, let all of
security flee before thee.

00:37:07.195 --> 00:37:10.630 align:middle line:10%
This is the strong
fortitude of all fortitudes,

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.240 align:middle line:10%
overcoming every subtle
thing and penetrating

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.130 align:middle line:10%
every solid thing.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.968 align:middle line:10%
And so the world was created."

00:37:18.968 --> 00:37:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may sound arduous
having heard all of these stages

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:90%
and the work involved.

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.090 align:middle line:84%
It may sound like it's
too much, or too hard.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.240 align:middle line:84%
But remember, this
alchemy is part of nature.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:35.280 align:middle line:90%
It's happening all the time.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
What makes it hard
is when we fight it.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.920 align:middle line:84%
When we don't work
with it, we're

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.440 align:middle line:84%
working against
the flow of nature.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what makes it hard.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:50.690 align:middle line:84%
The glory that Hermes spoke of
is living the alchemy of life.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.760 align:middle line:84%
When we live life
as an alchemist,

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.100 align:middle line:84%
this is how we achieve
our full potential.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:59.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why the alchemists
call this the Great Work.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the work is great,
but so is the reward.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:08.210 align:middle line:84%
This is about the
inner plane first.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:13.490 align:middle line:84%
As we accomplish this within,
then the outer transforms.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.200 align:middle line:84%
into the alchemy of
our world and where

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.460 align:middle line:84%
we are as a human collective
in making the big shift.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:23.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Teresa Bullard.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring
the mysteries of alchemy

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:30.130 align:middle line:84%
with me in this episode
of Mystery Teachings.
