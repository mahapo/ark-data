Is there intelligent
life beyond our Earth?

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.840 align:middle line:84%
The search for life
in the universe

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:84%
is one that has intrigued
humanity for a long time.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
The search shifts how we
think of ourselves as humans.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
It requires us to expand
our perception beyond Earth.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.930 align:middle line:10%
We wonder whether
we might be part

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:10%
of a larger galactic
or universal community,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:10%
whether there is some grander
cosmic play that we fit into.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we look at both
the scientific and metaphysical

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
perspectives on life
in the universe.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.030 align:middle line:84%
We've explored how
finely tuned our universe

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:90%
is for life and consciousness.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Like a musical instrument that
has been perfectly adjusted

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to perform the symphony
of life, our Earth

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.690 align:middle line:84%
is positioned in what
is called the Goldilocks

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
zones of our solar
system and galaxy,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:84%
to be ideally suited
for life as we know it.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Scientists today search
the visible universe

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.680 align:middle line:84%
for other planets that
share these characteristics,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.990 align:middle line:84%
where the ingredients
and environment

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
are just right for the emergence
of life and conscious beings.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
How many other planets might
host such conditions for life?

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Our current estimates
say that our sun

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.730 align:middle line:84%
is just one out of about 100
billion stars in the Milky Way

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:90%
galaxy.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
About 7% to 10% of those
stars are similar to our sun

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and have at least one
planet orbiting them.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Of those, the number that
have potentially habitable

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.650 align:middle line:84%
conditions range anywhere
from 1.9 billion up

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.330 align:middle line:84%
to 40 billion Earth-like
planets in our galaxy alone.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.500 align:middle line:84%
In addition, our
universe is estimated

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.400 align:middle line:84%
to contain nearly 2
trillion galaxies.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.050 align:middle line:84%
If just 1% of those galaxies
are anything like ours,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
that means there could be 20
billion galaxies that each host

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:90%
billions of Earth-like planets.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.780 align:middle line:84%
This brings the amount of
potential Earth-like planets

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.780 align:middle line:84%
in our universe to
staggering numbers.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
The odds that there
is life beyond Earth

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:90%
are extremely high.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
But what is the likelihood that
life on those other planets

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.610 align:middle line:84%
is as advanced, or even more
advanced, than life on Earth?

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth is data to be
4.6 billion years old.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
About 75% of the other
Goldilocks planets

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
are, on average, 1 to
2 billion years older

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.040 align:middle line:84%
than our Earth, some, even
up to 6 billion years older,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
giving significantly more
time for the evolution of life

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
on those planets.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.420 align:middle line:84%
With a universe so
finely tuned for life,

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and with such high numbers
of other Earth-like planets,

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:84%
the natural conclusion
is that there

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
must be more intelligent
life beyond Earth

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.050 align:middle line:90%
than most people realize.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's assuming that
life can develop only

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
in Earth-like conditions, which
is a rather limited assumption.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
To be sure, life is
abundant in our universe.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.430 align:middle line:90%
But what is life?

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.220 align:middle line:90%
How is it defined?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have come up with
a list of common traits found

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.530 align:middle line:90%
in living things.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, living things are
made of cells and they move.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Living things take
in and use energy

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
for various purposes such
as growth and development,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.330 align:middle line:84%
reproduction, metabolism,
response to stimuli,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.090 align:middle line:84%
adaptation to
external environment,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.280 align:middle line:84%
and regulation of
internal environment.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.910 align:middle line:84%
NASA has adapted a slightly
broader definition of life,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.510 align:middle line:84%
as being a self-sustaining
chemical system,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:90%
capable of Darwinian evolution.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.270 align:middle line:84%
But the general
bias in science is

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that life is
carbon-based organisms,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.190 align:middle line:84%
containing and replicating
DNA within their cells.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:84%
This biased assumption
about life being only

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
according to how we
experience it here on Earth

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:90%
is, again, rather narrow.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps our view of
what defines life

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
can broaden when we take a look
at how life might have begun.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
What does science say about the
origin of life in the universe?

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's still no
single origin-of-life model

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:84%
that is generally
accepted in science.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But all agree that
life in the physical

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
must have started with
some form of transition

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.700 align:middle line:84%
from non-living
to living, meaning

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
from chemical interactions
to biological life.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
Life must have
started with some kind

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:84%
of simple, molecular,
and chemical structure

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that contained
information, which

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.970 align:middle line:84%
could then be passed on from
one generation to the next.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Scientists also agree
that the origin of life

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:84%
was not a single event, but a
gradual process of increasing

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:90%
complexity.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Evidence from fossils
of microorganisms

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
found near hydrothermal vents
suggests that life on Earth

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
started soon after
the oceans formed

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.500 align:middle line:90%
about 4.4 billion years ago.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:84%
This would mean that
life began very early

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:90%
in Earth's development.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, the favored model
on the origin of life

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.140 align:middle line:84%
says that RNA,
Ribonucleic Acid, arose

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
as the first genetic material.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It starts from the
assumption that there

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.920 align:middle line:84%
were free-floating
nucleotides inside

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:90%
of a hot, primordial ocean.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And as enough energy from things
like lightning or radiation

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:84%
was added, the nucleotides
bonded together,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.650 align:middle line:90%
eventually forming RNA.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And while this may
be the favored model,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
it is rather
oversimplified, leaving

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:84%
things purely to chance
meetings of those nucleotides.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:84%
Another proposed
model, which is one

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that I tested as part
of my PhD dissertation,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.170 align:middle line:90%
was called genetic takeover.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It proposed that a
form of inorganic life

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:90%
started with crystals.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.620 align:middle line:10%
Crystals carry information
within their defect patterns.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.500 align:middle line:10%
As the crystals
grow and propagate,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:10%
they can transfer that
information of defects

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:10%
from one layer to the next.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:10%
One generation of crystals
can also become the seeds

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:10%
for the next generation.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.460 align:middle line:10%
We could think of crystal
structures, both the lattice

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.500 align:middle line:10%
and its defects, as a kind
of inorganic form of DNA.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Duplicatable information
is inherently

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.240 align:middle line:90%
embedded within crystals.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
However, crystal
growth can be messy

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and is not the most
efficient mechanism

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
for storing and
preserving information.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
But crystal surfaces do
also serve as substrates

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.460 align:middle line:84%
that biorelevant
molecules can adsorb onto,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:84%
thus providing them more
localized environments,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to combine together
in higher concentrations,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
forming more complex
chains of biomolecules,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
eventually building
up to RNA and DNA.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
These soon take over
the genetic process

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
as more efficient ways
of storing, replicating,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:90%
and passing on information.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Again, these are
just hypotheses,

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
but they reveal something
important to us.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.820 align:middle line:84%
At its core, life is about
information and the ability

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
to efficiently transmit
that information.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.950 align:middle line:84%
We could consider this an even
broader definition of life--

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:84%
the ability to
preserve and transfer

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.220 align:middle line:84%
information from one
generation to the next.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
From a quantum
perspective, information

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:84%
is the most basic ingredient of
the universe, more fundamental

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:84%
than energy, matter,
space, or time.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
If we put these
two ideas together,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:90%
what does this tell us?

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the ability to preserve
and transfer information

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:84%
is the most basic
aspect of life,

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and if information is the most
fundamental component that

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.540 align:middle line:84%
governs our universe,
we could say

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:90%
our whole universe is alive.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
Now, did life start on Earth?

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.250 align:middle line:84%
While it's possible that
life can start on any planet

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:84%
with water and the
right conditions,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
as many models presume,
it's also possible

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:84%
that life started
in outer space.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
In March of 2015,
NASA scientists

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:84%
reported that
complex DNA and RNA

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
can be formed under the
right conditions found only

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
in outer space, starting
with chemicals found only

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:84%
on meteorites and interstellar
dust clouds, which, by the way,

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:90%
are types of crystals.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.500 align:middle line:10%
Then, from outer space, these
microscopic forms of life

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:10%
were thought to be
delivered and distributed

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:10%
to planets by space dust,
meteorites, and asteroids.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, then
life would definitely

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:22.600 align:middle line:84%
be ubiquitous
throughout the universe.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But again, the scientific
definitions for life

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.940 align:middle line:90%
are very narrow.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
It's limited to
carbon-based life,

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:84%
forming and containing
DNA or RNA, using

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.220 align:middle line:84%
energy and information, purely
from this physical density

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:10%
One NASA scientist,
Silvano Colombano,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:10%
released a white paper
in December of 2018,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.710 align:middle line:10%
titled "New Assumptions
to Guide SETI Research."

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
In it, he challenged
several assumptions

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
that the scientific
community makes

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:84%
about life in the
universe, one of which

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
is this bias that intelligent
civilizations would

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.240 align:middle line:90%
be based on carbon life.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.890 align:middle line:84%
He says that "given the fairly
common presence of elements

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.260 align:middle line:84%
that might be involved
in the origin of life

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universe,
it's a reasonable assumption

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that life as we know it was at
least a common starting point.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But our form of life
and intelligence

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:26.140 align:middle line:84%
may be just a tiny first step
in a continuing evolution that

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:84%
may well produce forms of life
that are far superior to ours,

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and no longer based
on carbon machinery."

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.270 align:middle line:84%
Who's to say, for example,
that life on other planets

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.940 align:middle line:84%
couldn't be silicon-based
or, perhaps,

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
based on some kind of exotic
plasma of quantum particles.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Yet, even as we broaden our
definition and assumptions

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.210 align:middle line:84%
about life, scientists
are still entirely focused

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.580 align:middle line:90%
on just this physical density.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Could there be life
operating at higher frequency

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
levels that are beyond
our scientific detection

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:90%
mechanisms?

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
To answer that,
let's now explore

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
into the metaphysical
perspectives about life

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:06.430 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.550 align:middle line:90%
[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.870 align:middle line:84%
How do we define life from
a metaphysical perspective?

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, to begin with,
this physical body

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:90%
is not who we are.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:90%
The body is a vehicle.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Who we are, our true
life, is eternal spirit

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:90%
or intelligent mind.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
If we widen our view of
life beyond the physical,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:84%
if we take into account
the progression of spirit

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, we must
look at a bigger picture.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
We've explored elsewhere how our
universe is composed of 144,000

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:90%
rays, or density levels.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:84%
This physical realm exists
at the 144,000th ray,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
the densest and
lowest vibration.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistic and Mystery
School teachings

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.620 align:middle line:84%
describe how light forms
the material world.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.170 align:middle line:84%
As a vibration slows down from
the highest spiritual source,

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:84%
it passes through the full
electromagnetic spectrum

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:84%
of light, and then it moves
through the octaves of sound.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:84%
It continues down through
the various density

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:84%
levels, including ether,
and finally materializes

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.390 align:middle line:90%
in the physical.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Everything vibrates at
specific frequency levels.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Here on Earth, we humans
are attuned to perceive

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.610 align:middle line:84%
and experience a relatively
narrow range of frequencies

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:25.885 align:middle line:90%
through our senses.

00:12:25.885 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:84%
And we know that certain animals
and insects, for example,

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
detect different ranges
of frequencies than we do.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.830 align:middle line:84%
All of these can be considered
to be like different radio

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
stations playing in
the frequency bandwidth

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.310 align:middle line:84%
of the 144,000th ray
or density level.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Just at this one
density level, there

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is a rather wide
array of frequencies

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:90%
that are detectable.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Our five senses only
pick up a narrow range.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But our scientific
detectors are now

00:12:54.930 --> 00:13:00.240 align:middle line:84%
able to give us glimpses into
more of the energies available.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.340 align:middle line:84%
But there is still
much that lies

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.040 align:middle line:84%
beyond our technological
ability to detect.

Remember, also, that the
physical universe is mostly

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.650 align:middle line:90%
empty space.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.440 align:middle line:84%
If we condensed all
the atoms in our body,

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:84%
taking away the empty
space, then our entire body

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.710 align:middle line:84%
would fit on the
tip of a needle.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Generally, we are not attuned
to perceive the higher frequency

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:90%
levels.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.210 align:middle line:84%
We've become so accustomed
to only paying attention

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
to the obvious, that we
miss the subtle details

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and less dense materia
that surrounds us.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It could even be right
in front of our noses,

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.730 align:middle line:84%
and we still might not
become aware of it.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.940 align:middle line:84%
There could, potentially,
be higher dimensional beings

coexisting with
us here on Earth.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:53.440 align:middle line:84%

operating on the 143,999th

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:84%
level of density, just
slightly less dense than

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:90%
our physicality.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
They would be vibrating at
a different frequency range

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:90%
than we are used to.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.020 align:middle line:84%
There would still be
a kind of physicality,

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.100 align:middle line:84%
or density, but less dense
than our physical bodies.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:90%

are simply not aware of them.

system, long before
our telescopes could

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
see that it was a binary
star system, where one

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.840 align:middle line:90%
of those stars was burned out.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.870 align:middle line:10%

have stories that
point to the stars

sightings and interactions have

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
ramped up since we started
testing the atomic bomb.

and our galactic neighbors
came to check in on us again.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.119 align:middle line:84%
It is certainly
not the first time

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.670 align:middle line:84%
that aliens have visited
Earth, despite what

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.440 align:middle line:90%
mainstream science says.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And it won't be the
last time either.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:84%
Many people in the
ET field, however,

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:84%
get into all kinds of wild
theories and conspiracies.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And Hollywood
blockbusters also like

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
to add to our fears
of alien invasions.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.720 align:middle line:84%
But consider that if there are
extraterrestrial beings who

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.540 align:middle line:84%
have the capability
to travel to Earth,

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.560 align:middle line:84%
they are more advanced than us,
highly intelligent, and likely

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.840 align:middle line:90%
more evolved than we are.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they are here to help us
progress toward a more peaceful

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.310 align:middle line:84%
society, so we don't
destroy ourselves

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.860 align:middle line:84%
through this current
transition to a more

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.260 align:middle line:90%
technologically-advanced world.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.540 align:middle line:84%
Hermetic initiates have
talked about beings

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.480 align:middle line:84%
from other dimensions and
other places in the universe

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.550 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:10%
They say, for
example, that "even

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:10%
in our own little
solar system, there

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.320 align:middle line:10%
are regions and planes of
life far higher than ours--

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:10%
and beings, compared to
which we earth-bound mortals

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:10%
are as the slimy lifeforms
that dwell on the ocean's bed

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:10%
when compared to man.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
There are beings with
powers and attributes

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:84%
higher than man has ever
dreamed of the gods possessing.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet, these beings were
once as you, and still lower--

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.100 align:middle line:84%
and you will be even as
they, and higher in time,

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:90%
for such is the destiny of man--

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.475 align:middle line:90%
as reported by the Illumined."

00:18:35.475 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:42.590 align:middle line:84%
We might ask, why would these
beings take any interest in us

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.620 align:middle line:90%
at all?

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's start with the
foundation that we are all one.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.340 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Our progression, our actions,
what we do here on Earth

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.320 align:middle line:90%
ripples throughout the universe.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Our typical human
way of thinking

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:84%
is that they're out there
somewhere in the universe,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
but in truth,
they're all here now.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics
shows that everything

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.690 align:middle line:90%
is connected and entangled.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
The more evolved they
become, the more aware

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:18.290 align:middle line:84%
they are of this connection and
the dangers of thinking things

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.560 align:middle line:84%
are separate, like
we humans think.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, the more aware they
are of our situation,

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
of this critical point on
planet Earth, of course,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.200 align:middle line:84%
they are going to pay
attention and possibly

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.620 align:middle line:84%
try to prevent a
catastrophe from happening.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
Since we're all connected, the
progression of these beings

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:90%
is tied to our own.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Only when we start
to see ourselves

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.540 align:middle line:84%
as members of the
galaxy, as citizens

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:84%
of a universal
community, will we

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.570 align:middle line:84%
realize that our own progression
has an impact on the greater

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:90%
collective--

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.010 align:middle line:84%
not just the collective of
this planet, but the collective

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:90%
of the entire universe.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
When we expand our perspective
beyond the physical,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:84%
beyond Earth, we may, again, ask
the question, why are we here.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
We know that we are
here as spirit beings

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:84%
having a physical experience
to learn and grow from.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.590 align:middle line:84%
But is that all, or
is there more to it?

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The quantum and holographic
nature of our universe

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
suggests there is a
path of progression

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that continues on a much
bigger scale than what we often

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
think of.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Most of today's religions
deal with the story

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.120 align:middle line:84%
of humans on planet
Earth, that we

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.880 align:middle line:84%
are learning through a
physical experience and then

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
an afterlife that is centered
around our experience on Earth.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.610 align:middle line:84%
We're presented with a rather
limited and linear process.

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.710 align:middle line:84%
But the holographic
model requires

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.730 align:middle line:84%
us to expand our perspective
to a much more universal

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:51.450 align:middle line:90%
and multidimensional framework.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:90%
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.680 align:middle line:84%
In this more
expanded perspective,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
let's presume that
our universe is alive,

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that information is being
preserved and transferred

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
to direct the cosmic
symphony of life.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
quantum entanglement

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:84%
allows for information to be
transferred instantaneously

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:90%
across vast distances.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
This leads us to the questions,
what is this information?

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
If we call this
information knowledge,

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:23.490 align:middle line:84%
implying it is
purposeful and orderly,

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:90%
then where does it come from?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We've explored the ideas of
holograms, parallel realities,

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:90%
and the multiverse.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.830 align:middle line:84%
If this reality is a
hologram, the source

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
of this hologram,
the true reality,

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is being projected
from somewhere.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Our physical life
is a projection

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:84%
of encoded information,
while our true self

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
is at the center of
some higher reality.

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:84%
But our true self is not
limited to just one projection.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.660 align:middle line:84%
It can have many
parallel realities

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:90%
being projected simultaneously.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:84%
We've explored how "The
Science of Kabbalah"

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:07.170 align:middle line:84%
reveals that there are
22 holograms projected

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:84%
into this physical
density level,

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.020 align:middle line:84%
according to the pattern of the
Tree of Life and its 22 paths.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.420 align:middle line:84%
We might relate this
physical density

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:19.470 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive as so real
to be more akin to what

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
is depicted in movies like "The
Matrix" or "Ready Player One."

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a program, or a
hologram, that feels real,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:90%
but it isn't the true reality.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And Kabbalah says that there are
22 different holograms running

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.720 align:middle line:90%
in parallel.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.130 align:middle line:84%
Recall the analogy of a
cineplex with 22 theaters in it,

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:44.550 align:middle line:84%
each playing one of
the 22 holograms.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.410 align:middle line:84%
In each one, a
different archetype

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.270 align:middle line:90%
is the lead character.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And all of this is
happening here on Earth,

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.610 align:middle line:84%
while our true
self is watching it

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
all from some central control
room on a higher plane.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, our conscious
mind is usually

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.240 align:middle line:84%
only aware of one movie
playing, as viewed

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.120 align:middle line:84%
through the perspective
of our personality.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's dive deeper into
this notion of parallel lives

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.230 align:middle line:84%
playing out in the
22 holograms and how

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
they might tie in to the idea of
life elsewhere in the universe.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that our one
true, eternal self

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:84%
resides at the highest
vibrational levels of spirit

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and at the central origin
point of our universe.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.460 align:middle line:84%
From there, it sends
out 22 extensions,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
or aspects of itself, out
into the universe, anchoring

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.390 align:middle line:84%
the 22 paths, or archetypes,
of the Tree of Life,

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:90%
within our spiritual blueprints.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Each of these 22 aspects
becomes an informing template

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.220 align:middle line:84%
for the 22 holograms
that get projected down

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:54.040 align:middle line:84%
into this physical
density level.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's say one of those
aspects is sent Earth,

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
another to a planet
called Kolob,

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.400 align:middle line:84%
another to a planet within
the Sirius star system,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.830 align:middle line:84%
and maybe another to
the Kepler star system,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:84%
and so on, reaching 22
planets or star systems

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And each of us picked
a different combination

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.980 align:middle line:84%
of stars and planets
to work with.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.500 align:middle line:84%
But what we have in
common is that we all

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.080 align:middle line:90%
picked Earth as one of them.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, imagine that
from each of those 22

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:10%
aspects of our true
self that are anchored

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:10%
on 22 different planets
or stars, each one,

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:10%
also, then, sends out
a projection of itself

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:10%
to the other 21 planets, thereby
creating an intricate network

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:10%
and linking back to all
aspects of our total self.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:51.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, each location has all
22 information templates

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.610 align:middle line:10%
from the original 22 archetypes.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.210 align:middle line:84%
These are then projected down
into the physical density

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:84%
levels of those
planets or stars,

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:06.160 align:middle line:84%
resulting in the 22 parallel
realities on each planet.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.350 align:middle line:90%
One of those planets is Earth.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And here, we live out
the 22 archetypes,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:84%
projected through
the Earth template,

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.290 align:middle line:84%
as 22 parallel
realities or lives.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:84%
Through each of
them, our higher self

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that is overseeing
this Earth experience

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.540 align:middle line:84%
is learning about all
the aspects of life

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, in the physical.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, in one of my
parallel realities,

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.100 align:middle line:84%
I stayed in physics as
a research scientist.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.890 align:middle line:84%
In another, maybe I
became a psychologist--

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:90%
another an artist.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:90%
In one, I'm a pro athlete.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.490 align:middle line:84%
It's possible I could even
be a comedian in one of them.

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But in another one, I might
have become a drug addict.

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them are
good necessarily.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
But in this life, I'm a mystic
and initiate of the mysteries.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, here
on Earth, we have

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
strange encounters
or sightings of UFOs

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.550 align:middle line:90%
and extraterrestrial activity.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:84%
What if those aliens, coming
to check us out, are just us,

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:84%
the 22 aspects of our
real self, peeking in

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:84%
from outside the hologram,
or even their projections

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
from other planets,
paying us a visit,

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.750 align:middle line:84%
like when Neo goes
into the Matrix,

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:90%
but he's not bound by it.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Would we even recognize our
true self checking in on us

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.730 align:middle line:90%
to see how we are doing?

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Probably not, unless
we've integrated all 22

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.700 align:middle line:90%
archetypes back into one.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.460 align:middle line:84%
Then maybe, we might feel
a certain familiarity

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:90%
or recognition.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.990 align:middle line:84%
But still, they will
be beyond anything

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.450 align:middle line:84%
we have experienced here,
on our physical Earth plane.

[GENTLE MUSIC]

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.850 align:middle line:84%
If we have 22 holograms
on different planets,

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
each with 22 parallel
realities, and our true self

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:84%
is running all of these
different holograms

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and learning from all of these
different experiences at once,

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.630 align:middle line:90%
we could say we are everywhere.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:90%
This is all happening now.

beyond this physical Earth.

everywhere, connected

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.130 align:middle line:84%
throughout the universe,
like our concept of God.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:15.470 align:middle line:84%
We can think of it as
not just one cineplex,

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:84%
but 22 cineplexes, one
for each of the 22 paths,

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
or archetypes, on
the Tree of Life, one

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
for each aspect
of our real self.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And each of these cineplexes
has the 22 theaters inside,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.220 align:middle line:84%
playing out the 22 parallel
archetypal realities.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And our true self is watching
all of those monitors at once

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.500 align:middle line:84%
and sending signals and
information into all of them,

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.640 align:middle line:84%
to give guidance, support,
and redirection when needed,

so that we can fulfill
the greater plan.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.180 align:middle line:84%
And so far, we're just talking
about the holograms projected

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
into our physical experiences
at the 144,000th density level.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:10%
We don't really know how
many levels of holograms

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.000 align:middle line:10%
there might be at the
other density levels,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.540 align:middle line:10%
or how many realities there
are in the cosmos, or even

the multiverse.

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:84%

something like a DNA,

out across the

Why?

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it would be
too difficult to get along

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.010 align:middle line:84%
in this physical experience
with full awareness,

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.470 align:middle line:84%

our consciousness,

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.710 align:middle line:84%
grow in our maturity,
and gain access

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.110 align:middle line:84%
to our greater
multidimensionality,

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.020 align:middle line:84%
then our progression
opens up a door

to where we can step
onto a path that leads us

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.870 align:middle line:90%
to the central control room.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:84%
As we consciously reach
that control room,

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:84%
we become aware
that it's all us.

and what we call our assemblage
point, or the focal point,

perceptions of the world.

in telepathically

Now, what I've
just described here

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.840 align:middle line:90%
is the art of astral travel.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.060 align:middle line:84%
The word astral comes
from the Latin word

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.720 align:middle line:84%
"astrum," which means
connected to the stars.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.170 align:middle line:84%
Throughout the ages, initiates,
within the Mystery School

traditions, have
used astral travel

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.720 align:middle line:84%
to explore beyond
this physicality.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.620 align:middle line:84%
In its true form, astral
travel is an effective tool

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to assist us in expanding
our consciousness,

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.940 align:middle line:84%
remembering who we
truly are, and aiding us

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.500 align:middle line:90%
in our progression.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.100 align:middle line:84%
We can use it to explore
the vast universe that we

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:90%
are a part of and connected to.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.370 align:middle line:10%
Using astral travel,
we can gain insight

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:29.570 align:middle line:10%
into greater awareness of our
multidimensional realities.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:33.290 align:middle line:84%
We can travel and
explore all the 22 movies

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.020 align:middle line:84%
within the cineplex
of Earth and beyond,

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.600 align:middle line:84%
to other star
systems and planets.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.270 align:middle line:84%
We can meet ourselves
in other worlds

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and communicate with
galactic beings.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.820 align:middle line:84%
We can also astral travel to
higher spiritual dimensions

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.880 align:middle line:84%
and receive guidance from
masters of light residing

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:52.010 align:middle line:90%
in the spiritual planes.

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But to truly connect with
higher vibrational beings,

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:01.220 align:middle line:84%
we must learn to first shift
our vibration to a higher level.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Because in these astral
planes, like attracts like.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.290 align:middle line:84%
If our vibration is low, and we
use astral-travel techniques,

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:12.650 align:middle line:84%
then we will attract
low-vibrational beings to us.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.490 align:middle line:90%
And that is not what we want.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So we must first
use methods that

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.760 align:middle line:84%
raise our vibration
to an elevated state

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:84%
before we attempt
to astral travel.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But through this, we can
learn and become more aware

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.870 align:middle line:90%
of our galactic connections.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:34.100 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to
actually travel with our spirit

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.830 align:middle line:84%
As we do this, we expand our
consciousness even further

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and begin to shift into greater
awareness of who we are,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.890 align:middle line:90%
as galactic beings.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.470 align:middle line:84%
This expansion of
consciousness helps

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
us to progress toward greater
embodiment of our true self,

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:84%
to unite together all
aspects of our true self

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.770 align:middle line:84%
within our conscious awareness,
and shift into living

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.090 align:middle line:90%
a multidimensional life.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.660 align:middle line:90%
The universe is our home.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.040 align:middle line:84%
As we progress and come
to understand ourselves,

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:15.440 align:middle line:84%
as galactic beings, the
universe progresses with us.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.600 align:middle line:90%
What is life all about?

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, certainly, we
are here to learn

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.790 align:middle line:84%
about this physical density,
otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But what part of us
is doing the learning?

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Our body is just a vehicle.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.700 align:middle line:10%
It allows us to move
around on this Earth.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And it comes equipped with
the senses and nervous system,

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.070 align:middle line:84%
so that we can take
in information,

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.220 align:middle line:84%
respond to stimuli, and
also create with our hands.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.720 align:middle line:84%
But the part of us that
learns is our soul.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.950 align:middle line:84%
The soul is the operating
system of the body,

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.160 align:middle line:84%
but it's an intelligent system
that can learn and adapt.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.990 align:middle line:84%
While our personality's
perspective of life, this movie

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:84%
is linear, the true
quantum reality

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.060 align:middle line:90%
is that all time is now.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And from spirit's
perspective, all is now.

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:84%
As we expand our
consciousness, our soul

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:11.050 align:middle line:84%
also becomes aware
of all these times

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.800 align:middle line:90%
and places, as being here, now.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.699 align:middle line:84%
If this is true, and
if we are holographic,

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.699 align:middle line:84%
multidimensional
beings, then perhaps

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:23.679 align:middle line:84%
there's no need
for reincarnation

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:27.250 align:middle line:84%
in order to educate
and progress our soul.

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:31.360 align:middle line:84%
There are many possibilities for
how this can be accomplished,

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.609 align:middle line:84%
as well as how we can have
memories of past lives.

[MYSTERIOUS MUSIC]

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, we come back to
the question of purpose.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Why are we here, experiencing
ourselves through a hologram?

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And why is our universe
so finely tuned for life?

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:51.820 align:middle line:84%
In metaphysics, we say the
purpose defines the form,

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:54.489 align:middle line:90%
and form defines purpose.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Looking at the form reveals
clues to the purpose.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, in addition to
experiencing the physical

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and learning from it,
our higher purpose

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:84%
is the progression
of life itself.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.910 align:middle line:84%
We are waking up our potential
at each new level of awareness.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Progression is a waking
up of consciousness.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.510 align:middle line:84%
We are here on Earth with a
narrow awareness of who we are.

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Yet we have the potential
to awaken more fully

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to the greater reality of our
universal and eternal being,

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to become more aware of our
true self beyond this hologram,

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of all of
our 22 archetypal movies,

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:38.530 align:middle line:84%
happening on all 22
different planets,

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and then integrating
all of these

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.530 align:middle line:84%
into one, multidimensional
cosmic experience.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Through this, we begin to awaken
who we are as galactic beings,

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.840 align:middle line:84%
expanding our awareness
beyond mere citizens of Earth,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and coming into a greater
awareness of ourselves,

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.060 align:middle line:90%
as citizens of the galaxy.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Initiates in the Mystery
School traditions

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.270 align:middle line:84%
have long been aware of
this potential within us.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years
ago, King Salomon,

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.030 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest Western
Mystery School lineage holders,

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.180 align:middle line:84%
was searching for a way
to activate the Galactic

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:84%
Codes and the Divinity
Codes within each person's

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Tree of Life.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.870 align:middle line:84%
We now know this Tree
of Life is our DNA.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:84%
It is the blueprint
of who we are.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.020 align:middle line:84%
But most people come
into this physical life

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.140 align:middle line:84%
with only a fraction of
their Tree of Life activated.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:33.940 align:middle line:84%
King Salomon knew that there
was a time in the beginning when

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.530 align:middle line:84%
humans were fully activated,
but that we lost that over time.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Yet it was prophesied that one
day, humans would once again

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:47.110 align:middle line:84%
rise to their full glory, as
godlike, perfected humans.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And in Kabbalah, we call
this the Adam Kadmon,

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.490 align:middle line:90%
the perfected human.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:55.150 align:middle line:84%
King Salomon made it his
mission to discovering

00:36:55.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:middle line:84%
the universal methods to
reactivating all of our codes.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.880 align:middle line:84%
They made great progress at
turning on many of the codes

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.100 align:middle line:84%
and establishing the
foundation needed

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.260 align:middle line:90%
for our evolutionary leap.

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.410 align:middle line:84%
But the time was not
yet right for humanity

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to awaken their final codes,
during King Salomon's time,

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:19.030 align:middle line:84%
or to access their full power
of their galactic and divine

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:90%
But now is the time.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.140 align:middle line:90%
We are ready.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And the human
collective is poised

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:28.760 align:middle line:90%
to make a great leap forward.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.510 align:middle line:84%
We are the ones our ancestors
have been waiting for.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And this time on the planet is
one of the most exciting times

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:90%
to be alive.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it has its challenges.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.220 align:middle line:90%
And yes, we could screw it up.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But we now, also, have
huge opportunities

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:51.860 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish things humanity
has never accomplished before.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We have the
opportunity to activate

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.860 align:middle line:84%
our galactic and divine
nature, while still here,

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.920 align:middle line:84%
in this most dense
level of life so

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can embody our divinity
and galactic being, more fully

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.180 align:middle line:90%
in our life, here and now.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.840 align:middle line:84%
We are evolving into
a self-aware universe.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.090 align:middle line:84%
I am here, but also
I am everywhere.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:21.470 align:middle line:84%
When we open up to experiencing
reality from this greater "I

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:25.850 align:middle line:84%
am" perspective, we are
contributing to the progression

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:29.180 align:middle line:90%
of our universe.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we
gain deeper insights

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
into the science
of transformation

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and the rhythm of life.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.412 align:middle line:90%
I am Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:38:37.412 --> 00:38:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring the
mysteries of the universe

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:43.900 align:middle line:84%
with me, in this episode
of "Mystery Teachings."
