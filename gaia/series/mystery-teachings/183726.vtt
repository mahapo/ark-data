What mysteries
are to be revealed

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.500 align:middle line:10%
within the deepest parts of
our brain and body system?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:10%
An exciting new frontier in
both science and medicine

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:10%
is investigating how both
the gut and the heart

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.840 align:middle line:10%
operate as two
independent brain centers.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
the more we learn,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.730 align:middle line:84%
the more we realize
that the brain

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
in the gut and the
brain in the heart

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.190 align:middle line:84%
are more primary than
the brain in the head.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:10%
Our concept of the brain is thus
expanding into a more holistic

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:10%
framework as
science is beginning

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.570 align:middle line:10%
to recognize that there are
three brains in our body.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
How does this brain
within the gut

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:84%
fit in with our exploration
of consciousness?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.710 align:middle line:84%
To answer that, let's
begin by taking a look

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:90%
at the intelligence of the gut.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The gut has its own
independent brain system known

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:90%
as the enteric nervous system.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
This system is composed
of 100 million nerve cells

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
lining the
gastrointestinal tract.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:84%
That's more nerve cells
than the spinal column

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
and peripheral nervous system.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Talk about a
mind-blowing discovery.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
This system is
responsible for managing

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.780 align:middle line:84%
our digestive processes,
and it sends signals

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.580 align:middle line:84%
to the brain to alert us when
there's any sort of imbalance.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are finding this
communication is directly

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.490 align:middle line:84%
connected to the limbic
system and discoveries

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:84%
are leading to new
breakthroughs in how

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.387 align:middle line:84%
we think of the gut and
the brain relationship.

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
When we feel
anxious or stressed,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:84%
we have abdominal pain or
butterflies in the stomach.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Or if the digestive
system isn't doing well,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:90%
we can feel moody or depressed.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
It was once thought that anxiety
and depression caused issues

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:90%
within the digestive system.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But now, research is finding
it's more often the other way

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.180 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
How is this
communication happening?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, this brings us
back to the vagus nerve.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Not only does the vagus
nerve play a critical role

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:84%
in communication between
the heart and the brain,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's also a key player
in the brain and the gut's

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.880 align:middle line:90%
connection.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.110 align:middle line:84%
And this nerve runs from
the top of the spinal cord

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.020 align:middle line:90%
to all major organs in our body.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the main component of our
parasympathetic nervous system

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that controls our
ability to relax.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Stimulating the vagus
nerve fibers within the gut

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
influences the brain stem
and the limbic system.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Fascinating new research
shows that toning these fibers

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
reduces mood and
anxiety disorders,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:90%
like depression and PTSD.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do it?

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.670 align:middle line:90%
How do we tone these fibers?

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
One simple method is using deep
and slow breathing techniques,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.040 align:middle line:84%
like we use in meditation,
especially when we

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
slow our breathing rate
down to a rate of five

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.500 align:middle line:90%
to seven breaths per minute.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.180 align:middle line:84%
We can achieve this by
breathing in to a count of five,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.280 align:middle line:84%
hold the breath for
a count of five,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.680 align:middle line:84%
and then exhale
to a count of 10.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So what is the gut
communicating to the brain?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing, it's
clear that it's about

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:90%
a lot more than digestion.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
The state of our gut impacts
our motivation, our higher

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.010 align:middle line:84%
cognitive functions, memory,
intuitive decision-making,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason we talk
about having a gut feeling.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:84%
This information traveling
from the gut up to the brain

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
influences our
thoughts and emotions.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So science in the
West is just starting

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.730 align:middle line:84%
to recognize how
the state of the gut

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:90%
affects our overall well-being.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.650 align:middle line:84%
But for many ancient
wisdom traditions,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.080 align:middle line:90%
this isn't new information.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.440 align:middle line:84%
In traditional Chinese
medicine, each organ

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.110 align:middle line:90%
is associated with an emotion.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Stimulating the meridian
system strengthens that organ

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:90%
and restores balance.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:84%
The lungs and the
large intestine

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
correspond with things
like grief and depression.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
While the heart and the small
intestine correspond with joy.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
If we have an imbalance
in one of these organs,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:84%
we may be lacking in joy,
for example, or holding

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.130 align:middle line:90%
onto grief or sadness.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
And our emotions, they
can be stored in our body

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
and affect the
function of our organs.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.550 align:middle line:84%
If the gut isn't working
properly, there will be issues.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.890 align:middle line:10%
And this can affect
our emotions, memory,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.780 align:middle line:10%
overall cognitive functions,
and our health as a whole.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.230 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, we
thought of the brain

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
as the mainframe that
sends the signals

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the body.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
But now, we're seeing
that the deeper

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:84%
roots of this system,
the gut and the heart,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
are driving our brain
and daily consciousness.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Through this season
of Mystery Teachings,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.140 align:middle line:84%
we've been exploring how to
waken our greater potential

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and access transcendent
states of consciousness.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
To do so, we must build
bridges deeper and deeper

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
into our brain-body system
so that we can intentionally

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:90%
influence it.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Our next step on this
journey is to create

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
a state of homeostasis
within the gut

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and harness the full power
of this third brain center.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when the gut is
functioning at optimal levels?

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer this, let's
look at the bigger picture.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.590 align:middle line:84%
In many ancient traditions,
the more holistic perspective

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.860 align:middle line:84%
is that it's one of
three primary energy

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:90%
centers within the body.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Within Eastern qigong
and Daoist traditions,

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:84%
these areas are known as
the upper, the middle,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.306 align:middle line:84%
and the lower
tanden, or dantian.

00:06:33.306 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Now these are located at
the third eye, the heart,

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
and the hara, just
below the navel.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Is it any wonder that
these three locations

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.090 align:middle line:84%
correspond with the brain,
the heart, and the guts?

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.670 align:middle line:10%
These three energy
centers function

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.560 align:middle line:10%
as storage areas for our
life force known as qi.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
But each system
works differently

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
and with a different
quality of qi.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Now according to the Western
mystery school traditions,

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:84%
these three energy
centers relate

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:90%
to different levels of will.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
The upper tanden,
or third eye, is

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
said to be our connection
to the will of our spirit.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.050 align:middle line:84%
It's our connection
to our eternal being--

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.150 align:middle line:84%
the love, will, and vision
of our individuated spirit,

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:90%
our original self.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:84%
The middle tanden,
or heart center,

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is our connection to
the will of our soul.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:84%
It's our connection to the
love of our higher self,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.170 align:middle line:90%
and it's more personal to us.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
the soul and the spirit.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Now we can think of the
spirit as that big picture

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:50.270 align:middle line:84%
perspective of who we are as
an infinite eternal being.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.660 align:middle line:10%
While our soul is more
personal and directly connected

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:10%
to our purpose and our
contracts in this life.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.040 align:middle line:84%
The lower tanden, or
hara, located at the gut

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
is more of our
personal body's will.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.900 align:middle line:84%
This is our desires coming up
from the subconscious mind.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It includes the body's urges for
food, sex, life force, power,

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:90%
and pleasure.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's our primary storage
energy center for our vitality.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So how does this relate
to consciousness?

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
To get a sense of
that, let's use

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:84%
an analogy of a tree as
our neurological system.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:84%
The cortex is like the
upper leaves and branches.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
The limbic system is
the lower branches.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
While the brain stem is
like the trunk of the tree.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:10%
As we then go deeper from the
brainstem down to the heart

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.510 align:middle line:10%
and, finally, to the gut, we're
coming into the deepest roots.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
At the hara, we are at
the ends of the roots.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
draw nourishment up

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:84%
from the earth into our system
up through the root chakra.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.120 align:middle line:84%
The hara is then the
storage point, or reservoir,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.290 align:middle line:90%
of our body.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:84%
While the root chakra's how
we send that energy out to

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
manifest as well as draw
it up from the Earth.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
As we go deeper
into this system,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:90%
our consciousness deepens.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.870 align:middle line:84%
The deeper we go, the more we
lose our sense of personality,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
our masks dissolve, and we start
tapping into our core self.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Then as we go even
deeper, we begin

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to finally dissolve that sense
of self as an individuated

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
We begin to merge
with the collective

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and, from the
collective, we go deeper

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.250 align:middle line:90%
and merge with the oneness.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:90%
This is the final bridge--

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.470 align:middle line:84%
the expansion of consciousness
into oneness with all things.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:84%
We're moving beyond
our individuated self

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:90%
and into unity consciousness.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So how do we come into
this oneness experience?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.880 align:middle line:84%
To really experience that
oneness with the all,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
we first have to go
through the void.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.210 align:middle line:84%
The void is what
mystics describe

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
as a state of
emptiness, nothingness,

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
no thing manifested yet
all potential exists.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of quantum physics,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
we can relate the void
to the zero-point field.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.210 align:middle line:84%
This quantum view
can help us better

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
understand how to
connect with the void

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:90%
to reach the state of oneness.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But first, we must
find the gateway,

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:84%
or what is known in the quantum
physics realm as the gap.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.510 align:middle line:84%
We explored the gap
extensively in Season 1

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:90%
of Mystery Teachings.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Shifting into quantum
awareness becomes possible

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.220 align:middle line:90%
when we focus on the gap.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:10%
The time between events,
the space between particles,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:10%
the silence between
thoughts or sounds

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.540 align:middle line:10%
is the emptiness
between expressions.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Rather than focusing on
the expressions themselves,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.430 align:middle line:90%
focus on the gap.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.610 align:middle line:84%
The quantum gap is more
fundamental than the particles

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.740 align:middle line:90%
or events themselves.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:84%
The gap is like the blank
canvas or empty space

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.180 align:middle line:84%
upon which all objects
are painted or observed.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And this empty space
is the key to accessing

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.580 align:middle line:84%
universal consciousness and
the true nature of our reality.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:90%
And this exists within you.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
final bridge, what

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:90%
I call the expansion bridge.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.900 align:middle line:90%
It's the quantum access point.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And with this
expansion bridge, we

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
step from the I
am into the void.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.610 align:middle line:90%
We come into I am nothing.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I am empty of all things, and I
surrender to that nothingness.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.440 align:middle line:84%
Then as we pass
through the gate,

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.160 align:middle line:84%
it takes us from I am
nothing into the quantum

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:90%
sea of infinite possibilities.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.880 align:middle line:84%
We become one with
all that is, and we

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.140 align:middle line:90%
move into I am all things.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.010 align:middle line:90%
I am the limitless light.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Now how do we transition through
the gap to come into oneness?

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this journey
of consciousness,

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
we've been stimulating
the central nervous system

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.540 align:middle line:10%
But this final step of
the expansion bridge

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.200 align:middle line:10%
is about taking
away the stimulation

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:10%
and coming into stillness,
silence, and emptiness.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.130 align:middle line:90%
We surrender to that stillness.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:84%
This contrast sets us free
from the bounds of the body,

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
allowing us to expand
into the universe.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a surrendering, but it
takes a lot of discipline

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:90%
to come to that stillness.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
We surrender in order to
pass through the gateway

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:90%
of the zero.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:90%
We come to nothingness.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Our sense of time
and space disappear.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
We enter into the gap between
the moments of expression.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Our journey through these
three major energy centers

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.890 align:middle line:84%
of the upper, middle,
and lower tanden

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.190 align:middle line:90%
prepares us for this final step.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We bring our conscious
awareness from the mind

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
into the deepest
parts of our body,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:84%
connecting to that deep
stillness at the hara.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:10%
Once we connect at
the hara, we weave

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:10%
this energy back
up to the heart,

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.990 align:middle line:10%
then again to the third eye.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And this closes the loop like
the symbol of the ouroboros,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.560 align:middle line:84%
or the serpent
biting its own tail.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.380 align:middle line:84%
In doing this, we are
weaving the energy

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and activating this whole
circuit of the three

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:90%
major energy centers.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:84%
From a Kabbalistic perspective,
these three energy centers

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.750 align:middle line:84%
correspond with Yesod, Tif'eret,
and Keter on the middle pillar

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.590 align:middle line:90%
of the Tree of Life.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're activating the
middle pillar in this process.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.380 align:middle line:10%
We're opening up the way to
the supernal realm, where

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:10%
we may experience
unity consciousness,

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.820 align:middle line:10%
and then back down to flow this
light into our mind and body.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a state of being
that is fully in tune

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.620 align:middle line:90%
and aligned with source.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.960 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
reach that unity,

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
we must surrender our
attachment to self-identity.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.370 align:middle line:84%
The biggest attachment
we tend to have

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:90%
is often to our own identity.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.240 align:middle line:84%
We fear losing ourself
if we were to fully

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:90%
let go and enter into the void.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But this surrender is key to
finding our one true self that

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
is far more vast than the
personal self-image we hold.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We move beyond
the personal self,

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:30.270 align:middle line:84%
moving from I am
something to I am nothing.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And once we surrender, we
then have the opportunity

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
to experience the
unlimited potentials

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.960 align:middle line:90%
of the zero-point field.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.606 align:middle line:84%
We surrender so that we may come
into oneness with all things.

00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Now the biggest
challenges we face here

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.950 align:middle line:84%
are often our fear of the
unknown, our resistance

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
to letting go of control, and
our discomfort with silence.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
If we want to
access the void, it

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:06.450 align:middle line:84%
is key that we bring our
mind and body to stillness.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
We eliminate stimulation
and quiet our inner self

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:90%
by relaxing more deeply.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
The void is a non-visual,
non-auditory experience.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a simultaneous sense
of oneness, allness,

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.480 align:middle line:90%
and emptiness.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:84%
The moment we think any thought
or are stimulated in some way,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.740 align:middle line:90%
we're drawn out of it.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.760 align:middle line:84%
Often, we might not even
realize we were in the void

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:90%
until we shift back out.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Connecting with the void
requires a letting go

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.440 align:middle line:90%
of control and expectation.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.600 align:middle line:90%
We cannot control this process.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:84%
We can only open
up and allow it.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:00.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a surrendering of the mind
and the self into the unknown

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.810 align:middle line:90%
of the void, into nothingness.

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.829 align:middle line:84%
But the experience of expanding
and surrendering to the void,

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.280 align:middle line:84%
it's not a one time
experience after which

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%
we're forever more enlightened.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Rather, the void is always
here, right here, right now,

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.589 align:middle line:90%
right in front of you.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And when we establish
the pathways,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
we can cross this bridge
as often as we like.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.500 align:middle line:84%
We can access the gaps
between the moments and tune

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.576 align:middle line:84%
into the zero-point
field of quantum reality.

00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:84%
Now what do we do if
we tap into the void,

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.020 align:middle line:84%
but we can't seem to hold it
for more than a few seconds?

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Not to worry.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Even a brief time in
the void connects us

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.790 align:middle line:84%
with vast potential energy
and flows this energy

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:90%
into our personal consciousness.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And any time you find yourself
slipping out of it, just

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:84%
connect to your hara
and your breath.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.320 align:middle line:84%
The hara is an access
point to the void.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.990 align:middle line:84%
If the mind gets distracted, the
energy doesn't flow properly.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.140 align:middle line:84%
So to reconnect, we bring
our attention to the hara.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:18.250 align:middle line:84%
We focus on our breath,
breathing in and out

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:90%
through the lower tanden.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us
back into the void.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Once we connect with the
void, we must surrender.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Let go of our mind.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:90%
Let go of our thoughts.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:90%
Surrender to the stillness.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.660 align:middle line:84%
As we do, we allow
ourselves to pass

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.510 align:middle line:84%
through this gateway
that then connects

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:46.180 align:middle line:90%
to the limitless light.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.910 align:middle line:84%
Now what does this
all mean for us?

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:90%
What's the big picture here?

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:84%
When we connect to the
void, the quantum field

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
of all possibilities
becomes available to us

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:90%
so that we can observe it.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.670 align:middle line:84%
When we hold this state,
miracles are possible.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:10.740 align:middle line:84%
We access our full potential
to create miracles to manifest

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and to defy logic.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we are raising
up to our individuated self,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:23.760 align:middle line:84%
the true self, transcending
ego rather than denying it.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of alchemy
to transmute and transform

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.490 align:middle line:90%
into a more pure state.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
process of ascension.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And in this process,
there is sacrifice.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:84%
We are offering our attachments,
our ego, our personality

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.400 align:middle line:90%
onto the altar of sacrifice.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.420 align:middle line:84%
But in truth, we're sacrificing
the lesser for the greater.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
It's an act of
surrender and devotion.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:84%
We're letting go
of the distortions

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:84%
so the true self
can shine through.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And we are becoming the true
magician, or the Adam Kadmon.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:84%
In the tarot, this archetype
is represented by the magician.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:10%
And the magician stands
as the middle pillar,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.830 align:middle line:10%
with one hand reaching
up to source and one hand

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.260 align:middle line:10%
reaching down to the physical.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.730 align:middle line:10%
He is the conduit in perfect
alignment with divine will.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:10%
And there is a level of
purity, and he is actively

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.360 align:middle line:10%
stepping into that
role to be the conduit.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.340 align:middle line:10%
He's engaging his
will to align so

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:10%
that the pure
energies from source

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:10%
can flow through
without distortion.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.920 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
reactive posture but

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.960 align:middle line:84%
actively stepping into
alignment to be in the flow.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
The magician directs the powers
of heaven and the universe

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
into the physical,
into the four elements,

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
according to an
intention that is set.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And to achieve this
purity, the negative ego

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:59.580 align:middle line:84%
must be surrendered so that
it doesn't distort the energy

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:90%
coming through to manifest.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.670 align:middle line:84%
At this level, we can
accomplish and perform magic.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.820 align:middle line:84%
We can make things happen,
while not getting too caught

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:90%
up or attached to the process.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
We maintain our state of
balance on the middle pillar.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
stay in tune with it

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is to continue, starting
each day with connection

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.480 align:middle line:90%
to stillness.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.480 align:middle line:84%
We connect with
the source first.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we flow
that through our day.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And as we step into action,
we become the conduit

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
to allow that source energy to
flow through us in alignment

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.480 align:middle line:90%
with higher will.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:90%
It's very active.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's a choice we make.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Now to connect with
that state of stillness,

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.970 align:middle line:84%
start by sitting or
standing upright.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.800 align:middle line:90%
Then focus on your breath.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Inhale through the nose.

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Exhale through the mouth.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Pull the breath all the
way down to the hara,

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.650 align:middle line:90%
just below your navel.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Continue to focus on this point
as you breathe in and out.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Now slow your breathing down
using the following technique.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Breathe in to a count of
five in through the nose.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.790 align:middle line:10%
Hold your breath here in the
hara for a count of five,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.990 align:middle line:10%
holding it down here.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.630 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.857 align:middle line:84%
Then breathe out
to a count of 10,

00:22:37.857 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:90%
breathing out through the mouth.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:43.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Continue this
breathing technique

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.890 align:middle line:84%
until you feel yourself
dropping into a deeper

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:90%
state of stillness.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
You can even extend the time of
the pause between the inbreath

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.188 align:middle line:90%
and the outbreath.

00:22:57.188 --> 00:23:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the gap, the
stillness between the breaths.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
As you feel your sense
of self dissolving

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
and your mind becomes
like a quiet pond,

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:84%
you can gently
then drop your head

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
down a little bit into the space
just in front of your face.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But don't try to do that
until you really feel

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that sense of self dissolving.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So until then continue to focus
on this breathing technique.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Then once you do
drop your head down,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.950 align:middle line:84%
hold this position while
allowing your breath

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.522 align:middle line:90%
to now become more still.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Surrender to the void.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:90%
Just be in the stillness.

In Kabbalah, we have
a morning affirmation

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.220 align:middle line:90%
that we use every day.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.180 align:middle line:84%
I come out of the
darkness into the light.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.000 align:middle line:90%
I come with nothing.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.820 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I am empty of all things.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.740 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we tap
into that emptiness.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And only when we can be
empty and be the no thing,

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.940 align:middle line:84%
can we then pass through the
gate into the all things.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.930 align:middle line:84%
And then, therefore, I am
ready to receive all things.

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And we tap into the limitless
light that flows directly

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.805 align:middle line:90%
from source to us.

00:24:44.805 --> 00:24:47.490 align:middle line:90%

Ultimately, this journey is
about becoming the Adam Kadmon,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.230 align:middle line:84%
the perfected human, and
reaching our full potential

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.720 align:middle line:90%
as multidimensional beings.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.590 align:middle line:90%
This is who we truly are.
