00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.890 align:middle line:10%
But today, we're going to
meditate on the archetypes

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:10%
of the Devil and the Tower.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:10%
Together, they help us
face our shadow side,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.590 align:middle line:10%
so that we can awaken
to our total self

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.330 align:middle line:10%
and break free from the bondage
of false limitations and ego.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.390 align:middle line:10%
The Devil also awakens a
sense of humor and mirth

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:10%
in our lives, while the
Tower brings us a bolt

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.220 align:middle line:10%
from the blue that catalyzes
rebirth and rapidly releases us

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.260 align:middle line:10%
from false mindsets.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's the
formula to follow

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.660 align:middle line:84%
for invoking these two
archetypes, the Devil

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:90%
and the Tower, into your life.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
We'll first work with
one card at a time,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:90%
beginning with the Devil.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So once you're ready, find
the Devil card in your deck

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.720 align:middle line:84%
You could be sitting
on a meditation stool

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:84%
or cushion and place that card
in front of you on a table,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.230 align:middle line:84%
so that it's upright,
and then get yourself

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.000 align:middle line:84%
into a relaxed position and
a light meditative state.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Take several deep breaths.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Relax your body.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Begin to calm and
quiet your mind

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.110 align:middle line:84%
down, bringing yourself
to a state of emptiness.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.080 align:middle line:84%
To do this work, we want to
be in a positive, or at least,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
a neutral state of being
with nothing disturbing us

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:90%
emotionally or mentally.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So really take your
time at this point

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.530 align:middle line:84%
to bring yourself into
that state of peace

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.560 align:middle line:90%
and inner balance.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Once you've established
this state of inner peace,

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.490 align:middle line:84%
look at the image of the Devil
card for about 5 to 10 minutes

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes open.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Study its imagery
and its symbolism

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.090 align:middle line:90%
and take in the details.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.950 align:middle line:10%
Notice what comes up
with you, what gets

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:10%
stirred up from your shadow
side and your subconscious,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:10%
as you look at this card.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.720 align:middle line:10%
Commit this card to memory
with all of its details.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.930 align:middle line:10%
Ingrain it into your mind.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:10%
as you know meditate on
the symbolism of the card.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready after
those first 5 to 10 minutes,

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.630 align:middle line:84%
it's time to take it
inside and work with it

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
inside your mind with your eyes
closed for another 10 minutes.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Recreate the image
within your mind.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame
of the card is a doorway,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and on the other
side of that door

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
is the scenery of
the Devil card.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Build up all the
images and the symbols,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:90%
just like you saw in the card.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Really sit with this
and firmly establish

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:84%
this in your mind
for those 10 minutes.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Once the image is firmly
established in your mind,

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:90%
then let it come to life.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Walk through the doorway
and enter into the scenery.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.220 align:middle line:84%
Let it take on a
three-dimensional virtual

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:90%
reality kind of experience.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Engage your active
imagination and use

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
all five senses to really
bring this setting to life.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.710 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, just
observe for a while.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Notice the characters.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.200 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:90%
How are they behaving?

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.880 align:middle line:84%
What is the energy
that they emit?

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Do they have any messages?

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
part of your shadow

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.960 align:middle line:90%
that gets stirred up here?

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.840 align:middle line:84%
How can this card help you
recognize your own shadow

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:90%
side more?

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:10%
Where are your attachments
or your unexpressed qualities

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.820 align:middle line:10%
that you haven't yet
acknowledged within yourself?

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:55.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.550 align:middle line:10%
What fears does
it reflect to you?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:10%
Where have you fallen into
temptation or indulgence?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:10%
What is it that you
need to do to take off

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:10%
the chains that bind you?

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:46.710 align:middle line:10%
Once you've established a
strong connection with this key,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:10%
the next step is to
merge with the Devil,

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:10%
become this archetype.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:10%
See yourself as it.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:10%
Let it awaken in
you, so that you

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:10%
can bring your shadow more
fully to a conscious state

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.440 align:middle line:10%
and turn it into light.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.330 align:middle line:10%


00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.810 align:middle line:10%
When you feel integrated
with this energy,

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:10%
stand up and actually take
on the posture of the Devil.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:10%
Assume his archetypal
form and body position,

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.230 align:middle line:10%
imagining that you're
kind of hunched

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:10%
on a stoop with your right
hand up and fingers open,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:28.120 align:middle line:10%
and the left hand is
holding a torch downwards.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:10%
And say this affirmation, "I am
the Lord of the gates of matter

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.605 align:middle line:10%
and the child the
forces of time.

00:14:35.605 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:10%
I am the shadow that must
be brought to the light."

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Allow that to resonate
and to awaken within you,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:10%
vibrating all of your
cells to this awakening

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.270 align:middle line:10%
and this knowledge.

When you feel
integrated with that,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.730 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to move on to
the same process with the Tower

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:90%
card.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.260 align:middle line:84%
So we can put the one card
aside and now take out the Tower

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.740 align:middle line:84%
card, place it on the
table, sit in front of it,

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
so that you can meditate upon it
with your eyes open for about 5

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.460 align:middle line:84%
to 10 minutes, and begin to
study its imagery, its symbols.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:90%
Notice all the details.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Ingrain this upon your
mind and your memory.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:10%
Really take in all the different
aspects of the Tower symbolism,

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:10%
including the numbers, the
characters, and the state

Then after those 5 to 10
minutes with eyes open,

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.410 align:middle line:84%
it's time to take it
inside, to close your eyes,

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and work with this
image inside your mind.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:90%
Recreate the image in your mind.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Build it up, imagining again
that the frame of a card

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
is like a doorway, and on
the other side of that door

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.890 align:middle line:84%
is the imagery, the
setting of this card.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Really firmly establish
this image within your mind

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and solidify it through
that process of working

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:90%
with it for 10 minutes.

reality experience around you.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Use all five of
your senses, what

do you see, what do you
hear, what do you feel.

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:84%

anything that is no
longer serving you,

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:10%
any of those old attachments

take on the posture
of the Tower,

just straight upright,

and imagine yourself struck

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.490 align:middle line:10%
by lightning and the
ground beneath you shaking

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:10%
like an earthquake, and
even allow your body

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.020 align:middle line:10%
to rumble and shake and
see that as it does,

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:10%
whatever doesn't serve
you anymore is falling off

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.745 align:middle line:10%
of your body as you shake.

00:28:34.745 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:39.650 align:middle line:10%
And then when you
feel ready, you're

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:10%
going to state this affirmation.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.190 align:middle line:10%
"I am the Lord of the
hosts of the mighty.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.630 align:middle line:10%
I am the awakener.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.255 align:middle line:10%
I am the rebirth and the
rise of the phoenix."

00:28:51.255 --> 00:28:54.640 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.490 align:middle line:10%
Feel that affirmation
reverberating

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:10%
throughout your being,
activating your cells,

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:03.580 align:middle line:10%
and integrating this
energy within you.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.574 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:06.574 --> 00:30:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.780 align:middle line:10%
When you feel
established with that,

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.900 align:middle line:10%
next we're going to take out
both these keys, the Devil

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.360 align:middle line:10%
in the Tower, putting
them next to each other

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.020 align:middle line:10%
and meditating upon them
together, the Devil on the left

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:10%
and the Tower on the right.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.150 align:middle line:10%
As you look at
them together, see

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:10%
how they contrast each other.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.730 align:middle line:10%
Also see how they relate and
how they complement each other

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.320 align:middle line:10%
or what's similar
and what's different.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.470 align:middle line:10%
The Devil stimulates your
mirth or sense of humor,

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.290 align:middle line:10%
as well as your willingness
to face your shadow

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:48.140 align:middle line:10%
and free yourself
from its bonds.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.790 align:middle line:10%
The Tower stimulates
awakening and transformation.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we want to
take these energies

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.200 align:middle line:10%
and express them
into your outer life.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:10%
So ways that we can do that
are to bring the primary colors

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.890 align:middle line:10%
into our life, which would
be red for the Tower.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.900 align:middle line:10%
You can work with
black, or sometimes we

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:10%
also see a blue violet
for the Devil card.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:10%
You can bring this into your
environment and your clothing

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.810 align:middle line:10%
colors.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:19.070 align:middle line:10%
Also, remember to meditate daily
upon these symbols and images

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.040 align:middle line:10%
for the next week and
work with the affirmations

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.720 align:middle line:10%
that we just used.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of these cards

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.760 align:middle line:10%
and how they apply to
your life and then watch

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.670 align:middle line:10%
for these archetypes to show
up, both in your dreams, as well

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.820 align:middle line:10%
as synchronicities, maybe
through events, maybe

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:39.760 align:middle line:10%
through people, and
analyze their messages.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.540 align:middle line:10%
How does this
apply to your life?

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.450 align:middle line:10%
What is it trying to teach you?

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Also, especially
pay attention to how

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
you embody the strengths
and the weaknesses of each

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.290 align:middle line:84%
of these keys and
consciously work

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:53.750 align:middle line:84%
to make improvements
in these areas.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, realize that as
we work with archetypes,

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:84%
we will be setting forces
in motion in our life.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:middle line:84%
So especially here
at this stage,

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.790 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to engage
with this experience

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.280 align:middle line:84%
at a practical
level, then really

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.680 align:middle line:84%
commit to seeing this
all the way through.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Work with each of these
keys in their order.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't skip steps.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.110 align:middle line:84%
We're on the homestretch
here, so really

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.640 align:middle line:84%
give it your
attention, and see this

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:90%
all the way through to the end.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.660 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of tarot and how

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.780 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.
