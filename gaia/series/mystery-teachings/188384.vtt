00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:20.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.510 align:middle line:84%
Many people today are drawn
to working with crystals.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.030 align:middle line:10%
They may incorporate
crystals for healing work.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.510 align:middle line:10%
Or some people just like
the look and feel of them.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:10%
We like to have them
around in our home

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:10%
or carry them in our pocket.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's like bringing a friend
along with you for the day.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are also used
extensively in our technology.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.910 align:middle line:84%
For example, quartz crystals
can conduct electricity

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.880 align:middle line:84%
and are used to keep
time on our watches.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are also used in LCD
screens, LEDs, ultrasound,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.410 align:middle line:84%
sonar, radios, transistor
technologies, just to name

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.250 align:middle line:90%
a few.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:10%
And Silicon crystals are at the
heart of computer technology.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And many rare earth
minerals are also

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.540 align:middle line:84%
needed for all manner
of technologies today.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Now in ancient
times, the Atlanteans

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
were said to have an
advanced technology and power

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.130 align:middle line:90%
supply based on crystals.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And Ancient Egyptians used
various crystals and gems

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and jewelry and in the
materials for building

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.610 align:middle line:84%
the pyramids, and also
their magical burial rites.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:84%
What is it about
crystals that makes them

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:90%
such powerful allies to us?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And when I did my dissertation
research for my PhD,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I ended up working with crystals
to test a hypothesis related

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:90%
to the origins of life.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
And what I learned
about crystals

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.570 align:middle line:84%
is that they have
fascinating properties

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
and are intimately connected
to the essence of life.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot we can
learn from crystals.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
They can help us understand
more about ourselves.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And they are powerful
tools we can work with

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:90%
to realize our own divinity.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Are crystals alive?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Most definitely.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Crystals are alive
and they grow.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:84%
They have their own blueprints,
kind of like our DNA.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Not only do they
have a blueprint,

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.740 align:middle line:84%
but this blueprint is 100%
governed by sacred geometry

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
We see this in the
crystal lattice structure

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
with how the atoms or
molecules are arranged inside.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Marcel Vogel, a
research scientist

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.770 align:middle line:84%
who worked for IBM for 27
years and received many patents

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
throughout his life,
he went on to discover

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.290 align:middle line:84%
many amazing
properties of crystals.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
He determined that the
geometric structure of crystals

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is according to the tree of
life pattern from Kabbalah.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And because of this, it
caused the flow and storage

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:84%
of life force energy in
the form of negative ions.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.300 align:middle line:10%
He is quoted as saying, "that
the crystal is a neutral object

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:10%
whose inner structure exhibits a
crystalline state of perfection

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:10%
and balance.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.620 align:middle line:10%
When it is precisely cut in
the proper geometric form

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:10%
and when the human mind
enters into relationship

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:10%
with this structural perfection
in the vibration of love,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.580 align:middle line:10%
the crystal emits a vibration
which extends and amplifies

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.580 align:middle line:10%
the power and grasp
of the user's mind."

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
In other words, our
thoughts and intent

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.105 align:middle line:90%
can be amplified by the crystal.

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And based on his research into
what's called ether physics,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Marcel Vogel
developed what is now

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:84%
known as the Vogel-shaped
crystal to harness

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.480 align:middle line:90%
this ability more powerfully.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry is the
expression of divine energies

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:90%
within the physical.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
As the frequency of pure
divine energy slows down,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
it comes into the
material lattice.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
And it forms according to
specific proportions, harmony,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:90%
and types of symmetry.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
We see sacred geometry patterns
all around us in the universe

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
and even in the proportions
of our own body.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And crystals are among the
most perfect embodiments

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
of sacred geometry into
this physical density.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.220 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, sacred geometry patterns
exist within the crystal

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.360 align:middle line:90%
lattice structure.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:10%
There's symmetry,
order, repetition

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:10%
of a particular blueprint
pattern within their structure.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And this in turn determines
their overall shape, or what we

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:90%
call the habit of the crystal.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, pyrite-- it often
naturally grows as cubes.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And it has a cubic lattice
structure inside as well.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
Calcite crystals have
a rhombohedral habit,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:90%
like a slanted rectangle.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:middle line:84%
Quartz crystals naturally have
six-sided hexagonal habit.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.120 align:middle line:84%
They embody these
divine patterns

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:90%
within their structure.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
In essence, the sacred geometry
blueprint-- it is their DNA.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
these geometric patterns

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
can be arranged not just
upon the two-dimensional tree

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.790 align:middle line:84%
of life, but upon the
three-dimensional tree of life.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
The tree of life forms
the template for our DNA,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
blueprints of crystals.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, we can say
that crystals do have DNA.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
It's made of
different components,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
but the core
geometric blueprints

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.120 align:middle line:90%
are essentially the same.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And crystals grow according
to their blueprint,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:84%
which contains information and
instructions for their growth.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
So we can also say that they
are alive at some level.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:90%
How do crystals grow?

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Well, some grow in rivers.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Others grow through the
evaporation of water

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:90%
like salt or sugar crystals.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Some in caves, like
stalactites and stalagmites are

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.180 align:middle line:84%
formed as minerals get deposited
by the dripping of water.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Some crystals grow deep in
the inner belly of the Earth

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.590 align:middle line:84%
with layers of
heat and pressure.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
And that pressure pushes
the molecules together

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:90%
to form the crystal.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Metals, on the other hand,
start in a molten form.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And then as the cool, they
solidify into crystals.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Crystals form in different
ways, but they all

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
form according to
sacred geometry.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:10%
The atoms or molecules
come into alignment

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:10%
in the form of a lattice
structure as the most energy

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.390 align:middle line:10%
efficient way of arranging
the units in a compact way.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:10%
One fascinating new
field of research,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:10%
led by Juliana
Brooks Mortenson, has

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:10%
shown how we can also use
sound resonance to accelerate

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:10%
and enhance crystal growth.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.760 align:middle line:84%
When crystals are exposed
to this resonance,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:84%
they grow up to
2,000 times faster

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.500 align:middle line:90%
than usual, which is amazing.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
But what causes the wide
variety of crystals that we see?

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.100 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
different colors, patterns,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.490 align:middle line:90%
and qualities to crystals.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
characteristics are

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
defined by the crystal's lattice
structure and chemical makeup.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
The core structure is
a regular arrangement

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
of molecules or atoms according
to the symmetry group.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But we don't live
in a perfect world.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So even when grown under lab
conditions that are controlled,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
we will never get a
completely perfect crystal.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And actually what makes
each crystal unique,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.780 align:middle line:84%
what accounts for the wide
range of crystal properties,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:90%
are the defects in the crystals.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
For example, take
quartz crystals--

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.830 align:middle line:90%
what kind of quartz is it?

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it clear quartz,
amethyst, rose quartz?

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
They're all quartz, but
their colors and properties

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:84%
are different because of the
defects included in the quartz

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the impurities embedded
within the lattice that given

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.140 align:middle line:90%
their color and uniqueness.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:84%
These variations also give
slightly different properties

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:90%
for healing.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's the defects
within the perfect crystal

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:30.130 align:middle line:84%
lattice that give each crystal
its character and uniqueness.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Now let's think about
that for just a moment.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful lesson
from the mineral kingdom

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.640 align:middle line:90%
for us to reflect on as humans.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Often, were ashamed of our
flaws and imperfections.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And we try to hide
them or reject

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.920 align:middle line:90%
those aspects of ourselves.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But if we look at
the crystal world,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:84%
it's precisely
these imperfections

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that give them their
character, their usefulness,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and their unique ability to
perform certain functions.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Piezoelectrics is
one great example

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.440 align:middle line:84%
of the unique
characteristics of crystals

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.890 align:middle line:90%
that arise from defects.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Piezoelectricity is
an electric charge

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that can be generated in
certain materials, like crystals

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and even DNA.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.770 align:middle line:84%
The word piezoelectric
is derived

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek piezein, which
means to squeeze or to press.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
The electric charge
is created when

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.860 align:middle line:84%
mechanical stress is exerted
on the crystal structure.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And that stress squeezes the
crystal lattice structure

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.105 align:middle line:84%
into an imperfect form,
causing structural defects.

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And this technology
was discovered in 1880,

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and is used in
sensors and motors.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
But we're just getting
started with exploring

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the fascinating possibilities
of piezoelectrics.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:84%
One application is using
these materials in flooring.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And as people walk over
it, the mechanical stress

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
within the crystals
generates electricity.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.960 align:middle line:10%
This energy can then be used to
power the lights of a building.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's already being used in
some airports, train stations,

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:90%
and even light up dance floors.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Now the ability for crystals
to conduct electricity

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.570 align:middle line:84%
is based on the defects and
impurities within the otherwise

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.130 align:middle line:90%
perfect crystal structure.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
When we consider
this, what does this

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.310 align:middle line:84%
tell us about divine energy
as it's being embodied

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:90%
into the physical density?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing, it suggests
that our defects are likely

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
a part of our gifts and
our natural unique purpose

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:90%
that we are here to fulfill.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
They're not to be pushed away,
but embraced and explored

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
to discover our
unique expression.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:84%
This unique quality
of each crystal

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
goes even deeper than their
classification as clear quartz

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
or rose quartz or
citrine, and so on.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Even within a group of
the same type of crystals,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.390 align:middle line:90%
no two crystals are alike.

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
of their defects.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:84%
They make every
single crystal unique.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Just like every single person
is unique within their own DNA,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
crystals too have their
own unique blueprints.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.940 align:middle line:84%
What mysteries do crystals
reveal to us about life?

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that crystals
hold some of the keys

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:90%
to how biological life began?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.820 align:middle line:84%
A large part of my
dissertation research

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
was in the field of crystal
growth and material science.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And as part of my
dissertation work,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
I was the first to put
a hypothesis called

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:90%
genetic takeover to the test.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
This idea was first proposed by
Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith,

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
an organic chemist and
molecular biologist

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Glasgow.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.000 align:middle line:84%
He suggested that life
must have started first

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.470 align:middle line:84%
in some kind of inorganic
form before it could build up

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
to become the organic
forms we know of today.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.990 align:middle line:84%
He knew that the early
Earth was a hot, soupy mess.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And this meant that any
bonding of atoms or molecules

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.460 align:middle line:84%
would have had to start out
in more simple arrangements,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.670 align:middle line:84%
such as are found in
inorganic materials.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.120 align:middle line:84%
These would become then
the early templates

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.060 align:middle line:84%
for more complex and
organic materials

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:90%
to eventually form on.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And at some point down the
line, the more efficient

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.200 align:middle line:84%
genetic material of DNA
or RNA would take over.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:84%
So what kinds of materials might
have contained a prebiotic form

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:90%
of duplicatable information?

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, Cairns-Smith
envisioned crystals

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.030 align:middle line:90%
as the perfect candidates.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Now before I go on, let me just
say that this genetic takeover

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.560 align:middle line:84%
hypothesis was not the favored
model for how life began.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But it was always referenced in
the origin of life literature

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.390 align:middle line:90%
as one possibility.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
However, it was always
presented with the caveat

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:90%
that it had never been tested.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to put this
creative idea to the test

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:90%
to see what we might discover.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into
those results,

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:26.440 align:middle line:84%
let's take a few steps
back for a moment.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.580 align:middle line:84%
What is the most
basic definition

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.110 align:middle line:84%
for life that we're
talking about here?

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
At a fundamental level, physical
life requires three things.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.570 align:middle line:84%
First is the ability to
store meaningful information.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Second is that this information
can be replicated and passed

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.960 align:middle line:90%
on to future generations.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And third is the right
balance between preservation

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
versus mutation of
that information

00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.420 align:middle line:84%
in order to allow for
evolution to happen.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.690 align:middle line:84%
If there's too much loss or
degradation of the information,

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.150 align:middle line:90%
then life will not propagate.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
But if there's no
mutation or adaptability,

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:90%
there's no room for evolution.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Cairns-Smith suggested
that crystals

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.260 align:middle line:90%
could meet these criteria.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, the information
could be contained

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:90%
in their defect patterns.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And some of those
defects could then

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:84%
propagate from one
generation to the next

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.670 align:middle line:84%
through crystal growth
and replication.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of these defects
are inherent within the process

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.240 align:middle line:90%
of crystal growth.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.360 align:middle line:90%
For example, structural defects.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:10%
In my research, we had a
way to detect and image

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:10%
a specific type of defect
known as a screw dislocation.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
What's a screw dislocation?

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, this happens when
there is a dislocation

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:84%
within the perfect
crystal structure.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:15:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a ramp or growth
surface for new molecules

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:90%
to absorb onto.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.330 align:middle line:84%
In the early stages
of crystal formation,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:90%
they tend to be messy.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:10%
This causes the
otherwise perfect lattice

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:10%
to form misalignments
or dislocations.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
As the crystal
continues to grow,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
molecules wander around
the surface of the crystal

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.750 align:middle line:84%
until they find themselves
in the kink of that ramp.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And here they have a
higher chance of bonding,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
and thus add onto the
edge of that dislocation.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
As more molecules
bind at these sites,

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that growth edge spirals around
and upwards like a screw.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.600 align:middle line:90%
Now why does this matter?

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out that
most crystals would not

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:49.480 align:middle line:84%
grow if it weren't for this
specific type of defect.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It's necessary
within crystal growth

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.210 align:middle line:90%
to form these dislocations.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.222 align:middle line:84%
So how might we apply
this concept to our life?

00:16:00.222 --> 00:16:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, it reflects to
us that perhaps it's

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.830 align:middle line:84%
necessary for all things
to have defects in order

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.150 align:middle line:84%
for them to grow and live
here in the physical.

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:14.300 align:middle line:84%
After all, isn't that
what life is constantly

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle line:90%
presenting us with--

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:84%
opportunities to learn and
grow from our own flaws?

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So my research worked
with a particular type

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of molecular salt crystal
that was easy to grow

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.510 align:middle line:90%
in a lab from a water solution.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd put fluorescent
dyes into the solution.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And as the crystals grew,
some of the dye molecules

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:84%
would selectively label
the screw dislocations.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
This allowed us to image them
using a confocal microscope,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.210 align:middle line:84%
which allowed us to look into
the crystal's growth history,

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:90%
kind of like a fossil record.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And we could see that
the screw dislocations

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:84%
were propagated through many
layers of crystal growth.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And there'd be
multiple dislocations

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:02.120 align:middle line:84%
forming an overall pattern,
possibly holding information.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine the information
contained in these defect

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
patterns to be much like those
old computer punch cards.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.300 align:middle line:84%
We also took some
of these crystals

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and cleaved them apart,
and then used those layers

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:84%
to seed the new generation
of crystal growth.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
The growth would then continue
from the points of the screw

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.359 align:middle line:90%
dislocations.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:27.755 align:middle line:84%
This is how we tested one aspect
of the Cairns-Smith hypothesis.

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And the defects contained
information templates

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
within the crystal
structure, fulfilling

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:90%
the first criteria for life.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%
What kind of information?

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, most scientists
at the time

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.160 align:middle line:84%
assumed that the defects would
be purely random patterns

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:90%
without any rhyme or reason.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But through fractal analysis,
I showed that they're not

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:90%
entirely random.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
The patterns have a
fractal dimension to them,

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
governed by the rules of
the crystal symmetry group.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.350 align:middle line:84%
So there was actually a type
of order to the arrangements

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:90%
of these dislocations.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.690 align:middle line:84%
This information was
then able to be passed on

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.880 align:middle line:84%
to the next generation
of crystals,

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.030 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling the second
criteria for life.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.550 align:middle line:84%
However, the third criteria
for the proper balance

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
between preservation
versus mutation

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
is where crystals
run into trouble.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:84%
There was decent
preservation of the defects

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.840 align:middle line:84%
from one generation
to the next, but there

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:90%
was a lot more mutation.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Even if crystals did form
early templates for life,

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
they were not a very
efficient genetic material.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:39.520 align:middle line:84%
But no doubt, they are a
form of inorganic life.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Many people loved to use
crystals for healing purposes.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
What is it about crystals that
make them such powerful tools

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.480 align:middle line:90%
for healing?

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.070 align:middle line:84%
When we work with
crystals, we're

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:90%
working with Mother Gaia energy.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.370 align:middle line:84%
This is the energy of
manifestation, of homeostasis,

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:90%
and being grounded.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the energy of life.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:84%
This makes crystals
powerful healing tools.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
I've used crystals
very effectively

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.750 align:middle line:84%
when someone's had a physical
issue or a trauma of some kind,

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
such as when the nervous
system is in a shock mode.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:middle line:84%
The crystals are
very gentle and they

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:84%
help them heal and
settle in and ground

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:90%
from the shock of the trauma.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
I've also used
crystals to clear out

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.230 align:middle line:84%
allergies and other
physical issues

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.390 align:middle line:84%
and to help with healing all
the emotional and mental wounds.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.280 align:middle line:84%
When we do healing
work with crystals,

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:84%
we talk about flowing
energy or light within them.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Crystals have an intimate
relationship with light--

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
not only from the
perspective of metaphysics,

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
but also from a
scientific point of view.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, within the
crystal structure

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.870 align:middle line:84%
are symmetry planes
or mirror planes.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And when light shines
through the crystal,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:84%
it's refracted based on its
symmetry and the arrangements

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
of the crystal
lattice structure.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
This will do something
then to the light.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.240 align:middle line:84%
It may rotate it,
it might reflect it,

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
or it might redirect
it in some way.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We also need to remember
that at the atomic level,

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.670 align:middle line:84%
every atom of the
crystal is vibrating.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The temperature of
the crystal will

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.740 align:middle line:90%
change that level of vibration.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And the bonding forces
between the atoms

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
or the strength of
attraction between the atoms

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.830 align:middle line:84%
will also affect the
rate of vibration.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
As light comes in, it shifts
the vibration of those atoms.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the intensity of
the light and its frequency,

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:84%
it will interact with the
atoms on an atomic level.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.540 align:middle line:84%
Certain superconducting
crystals become even fluorescent

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:90%
under ultraviolet light.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:84%
When light enters
the medium that

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:58.020 align:middle line:84%
is different from the density
of air, it will bend or refract.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen how light
travels through a prism,

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
for example, which
is a type of crystal.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:84%
And that white light
is then refracted out

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:90%
into a rainbow of colors.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And different crystals will do
different things with the light

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.720 align:middle line:90%
as it passes through.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So how does this relate to
using crystals for healing work?

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, when we're working
with crystals for healing,

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
we're sending a form
of light through them.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual
light, or light that

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:84%
is based on life force
energy and conscious intent.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.920 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it
as a ray of vibration

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
at a higher frequency
level than visible light.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And that crystal takes that
energy in and then does

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:90%
something with it.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.900 align:middle line:84%
It may color it,
it may amplify it,

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:84%
or it might refract it in a
certain way to spread it out.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Different crystals will
work in different ways.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And one of the best
crystals to work

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
with for transmitting light
in a very pure way is quartz.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Quartz has many properties
and practical applications.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
One amazing thing
about quartz is that it

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:09.110 align:middle line:90%
generates its own energy.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And in metaphysics, we
use it as an amplifier.

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It will amplify the
energy and bring it

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
into a laser-like focus.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, clear quartz is used most
often for magical purposes.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:10%
Because with clear quartz
we can transmit pure light

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:10%
without any distortions.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Clear quartz will channel
and amplify the magic

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.170 align:middle line:90%
without distorting it.

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.770 align:middle line:84%
We could say that it focuses
the pure hermetic ray,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.880 align:middle line:84%
or the pure life force
energy, into the physical.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Other types of quartz will
take in that pure light

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:90%
and direct it in a specific way.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Rose quartz, for example,
will soften it and bring it

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.700 align:middle line:84%
into the pink spectrum, which
works more with the heart

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.100 align:middle line:90%
energy and emotional healing.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Amethyst takes in
that pure energy

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:84%
and then moves it into
the purple spectrum.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.930 align:middle line:84%
It works with the spiritual
third eye and the higher mind.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.990 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
wonderful crystals

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to work with beyond quartz, such
as selenite, calcite, kynaite,

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.500 align:middle line:90%
jasper, and so much more.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.940 align:middle line:84%
They all do different things due
to their different compositions

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.470 align:middle line:90%
and structures.

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Diamonds also have
a very pure light.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're even more
amplifying than quartz,

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.136 align:middle line:84%
but quartz is easier to
work with in general.

00:23:29.136 --> 00:23:30.960 align:middle line:84%
Now have you ever
noticed yourself

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
being drawn to a
certain type of crystal,

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.590 align:middle line:84%
almost like a particular
crystal spoke to you?

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
The more you work with
crystals, the more

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:44.040 align:middle line:84%
you'll discover each crystal
is a unique individual.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.890 align:middle line:84%
No two rose quartz
stones are the same.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:90%
We can't generalize them.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Just like we build
relationships with people,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.220 align:middle line:84%
we can also develop our
relationship with our crystals.

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.800 align:middle line:10%
Since each crystal
is a unique being,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:10%
how do we get to
know this being?

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Have you tried talking
to your crystals?

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Get to know them and work
with them intuitively,

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:90%
not just intellectually.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Ask them questions, and tell
them what you'd like help with.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.630 align:middle line:10%
While books like
the "Crystal Bible"

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.910 align:middle line:10%
can be helpful,
we want to develop

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:10%
our own personal, intuitive
relationship with crystals,

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.440 align:middle line:10%
paying attention to the
unique characteristics

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.070 align:middle line:10%
of each crystal, its
unique flavor of energy,

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:10%
helps us get to
know our crystals.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Even though crystals
embody Earth's

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:37.200 align:middle line:84%
elemental consciousness,
they contain the energies

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of all four elements
in different amounts.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, garnet
or carnelian tend

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.780 align:middle line:84%
to have more of a
fire energy to them.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Blue calcite and larimar
have more of a water energy,

00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.450 align:middle line:90%
and are very soothing.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
The air element
often corresponds

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.500 align:middle line:84%
with a bright yellow
color of stone,

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.400 align:middle line:90%
like yellow calcite and citrine.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:90%
Air is also related to the mind.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And certain stones that
work with the mind level

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:08.850 align:middle line:84%
would include things
like sodalite and lapis.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.850 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds of
agates or brownstones

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:15.320 align:middle line:84%
that correspond more with
that deep, earthy feeling.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.040 align:middle line:90%
And they're very grounding.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Also, shungite is another
earthy-type of stone.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Shungite is very
special because it

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:84%
comes from deep within
the Earth and is very old.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So we really have all four
elements within the Earth

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.610 align:middle line:90%
element of the mineral kingdom.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can tune in and
be aware of which element

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.540 align:middle line:84%
each stone is working
with primarily

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.870 align:middle line:90%
as we get to know our crystals.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Once you've found a crystal
friend and brought it home,

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:90%
how do you treat them?

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:90%
How do you store them?

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that crystals come
from the womb of Mother Gaia.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:84%
They're taken from
the sacred space

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.410 align:middle line:90%
within the ground or a cave.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And we humans are removing them
from their natural environment.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So how do we provide a sacred
and comfortable space for them

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.280 align:middle line:90%
when we bring them to our home?

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a great
question to reflect on.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:84%
When we buy crystals
from a store,

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.900 align:middle line:84%
they're usually not in
the type of environment

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.070 align:middle line:90%
that they want to live in.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.490 align:middle line:84%
We can create that
sacred space for them

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:27.270 align:middle line:84%
when we honor them as
unique, individual beings

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:29.200 align:middle line:90%
that they are.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And what kind of
environment might a crystal

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.530 align:middle line:90%
like at our home?

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, they like to be out
so that they can be seen

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.460 align:middle line:84%
and not hidden away
in a box or closet.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But if they have to
be stored, then they

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.350 align:middle line:84%
should be kept in natural
materials, like leather,

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:90%
cotton, silk, or wood.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Leather is a more
insulating material,

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and it will keep their
energy more quiet.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.980 align:middle line:84%
But honestly, they
prefer to be out

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.630 align:middle line:90%
where they can work with us.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And if we just bring
our attention to them

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.720 align:middle line:90%
to work with us, then they do.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:90%
How do they work with us?

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, crystals can be used
to help us on all levels.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's mental, emotional,
physical, or spiritual,

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.090 align:middle line:84%
all levels of our
being can be supported

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:90%
by working with crystals.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.750 align:middle line:84%
They are alive and
we can talk to them.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.060 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, each
crystal is a unique being.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So hold it in your hands
and bring it near your heart

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.770 align:middle line:90%
to communicate with it.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
You can talk out loud or
telepathically in your mind.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Tell it what you want help with.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.660 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
have a stomach ache,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
you can let them
know and request,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:84%
please help bring me
back to homeostasis.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Once you talk to
your crystal, you

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.130 align:middle line:84%
may have a sense of
how to work with it.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
You may lay it on your body
or carry it in your pocket

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.910 align:middle line:90%
through your day.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
The key is to trust
your intuition.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:84%
When picking which
crystal to work with,

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.230 align:middle line:90%
scan with your intuition.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And notice which
one speaks to you.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Trust yourself.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't rely on books to tell you.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.320 align:middle line:84%
This is about how you
build your relationship

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.390 align:middle line:90%
with your unique crystals.

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we build our
relationship with our crystals,

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we open the door to
collaboration with the mineral

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:18.400 align:middle line:90%
kingdom.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:84%
The mineral kingdom supports
us as powerful mediators

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:26.936 align:middle line:84%
to bring divine energy into the
physical in a very pure way.

00:28:26.936 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And one way that we
honor our crystals

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:33.440 align:middle line:84%
is to pay attention
and care for them.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.510 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to
know to properly care

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:90%
for our crystal friends?

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, one thing to keep in mind
is that they like the sunlight.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So putting them
out about at least

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:84%
once a week where they can
be in the sunlight is good.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.950 align:middle line:84%
But with too much sun,
they can get dried out.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So if they're getting dry,
you can massage them with oil

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.600 align:middle line:90%
to give them some moisture.

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Another big aspect
of crystal care

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.790 align:middle line:84%
is to regularly
cleanse your crystals.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.620 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
most effective ways

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.720 align:middle line:90%
to cleanse our crystals?

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, since many
crystals grow from water,

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:84%
one of the best and fastest
ways to cleanse them

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.310 align:middle line:90%
is to give them a bath.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Use running water, like
in a fountain or a stream,

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.750 align:middle line:84%
and allow for 24 hours
in this running water

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.150 align:middle line:84%
to complete the
cleansing process.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Another method is to
immerse the crystals

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.038 align:middle line:84%
in a bowl of sea salt
for a couple of days.

00:29:30.038 --> 00:29:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Now there are a couple
types of crystals

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that don't need clearing,
because they self clear.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And these include selenite,
kyanite, and yellow calcite.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And also be aware that some of
the softer, more flaky types

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.320 align:middle line:90%
of crystals dissolve in water.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Selenite, for example,
will dissolve in water.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So be careful not to put these
types of crystals in the water.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And what do we do after
the crystals are cleansed?

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can charge them
so that they will be fully

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:90%
refreshed and full of energy.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:84%
One method for
charging our crystals

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.570 align:middle line:84%
has to leave them outside for
a 24-hour period on a full moon

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.640 align:middle line:90%
night.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Place them where
they can directly

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:15.240 align:middle line:84%
take in the moonlight
and the sunlight.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:84%
I also have a big amethyst
geode that's like a little cave

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:24.320 align:middle line:84%
that I put the crystals
inside of to charge up.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.840 align:middle line:84%
What are some other ways that
we can work with crystals

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.300 align:middle line:90%
to support us in our life?

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can wear them through
our day, such as on a necklace

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.730 align:middle line:90%
or some kind of jewelry.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Or we can carry
them in our pocket.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we do this, it's
like taking our friend along

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:middle line:84%
with us to help us
throughout the day.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.920 align:middle line:84%
We can also use the crystals
to enhance our dreams

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.860 align:middle line:84%
or to enhance the
energy of our home.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, how does this work?

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, in our home we can
create a sacred geometry grid

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.000 align:middle line:84%
with the crystals to enhance
the energy of the space.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.830 align:middle line:84%
Crystal gridding
techniques used to be

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:04.310 align:middle line:84%
part of the ancient
temple building mysteries.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Before they even built
the physical temple,

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
the first step would be to
ask the divas or the goddess

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
entity of that land for
permission to build there.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.330 align:middle line:84%
They would use dowsing
to find vortex spots,

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.900 align:middle line:84%
or certain places have
deep wells of water

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that run underground, or
perhaps magnetic energy lines

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth might
have crossed there.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:90%
These become the power points.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Once the land and the power
spots have been identified

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.830 align:middle line:84%
and then permission granted by
the divas and the elementals

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:84%
to build there, they would
then anchor a sacred energy

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.960 align:middle line:90%
with a crystal grid.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.310 align:middle line:84%
This is done with specific
patterns and chants

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.540 align:middle line:90%
to clear and bless the space.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:58.240 align:middle line:84%
All of this would happen before
they even laid the foundation.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we can
also bring into our homes

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:03.430 align:middle line:90%
and workplaces today.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry
patterns are traced out

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:84%
by walking it out in a
proper sequence and flow,

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.928 align:middle line:84%
and then anchoring each of
the points with crystals.

00:32:13.928 --> 00:32:15.970 align:middle line:84%
This is something we teach
in the mystery schools

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:20.530 align:middle line:84%
to enhance a space with
crystals and sacred geometry.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And it calls in
energies for protection,

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.140 align:middle line:84%
for creating greater
harmony, for supporting us

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.675 align:middle line:84%
with abundance
and manifestation.

00:32:28.675 --> 00:32:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
patterns and formulas

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that we use to
anchor these grids.

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:10%
Each grid is used
to enhance the space

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.500 align:middle line:10%
so it feels more expansive.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.470 align:middle line:10%
It also thins the
veil so that it

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:45.430 align:middle line:10%
feels more like a temple
space, more sacred.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And people who come
into these spaces

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.110 align:middle line:84%
without even knowing that
there is a grid in place

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:54.430 align:middle line:84%
will often comment on how
amazing the space feels.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.220 align:middle line:84%
They say it feels bigger,
or like they just stepped

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.470 align:middle line:90%
into a higher elevation.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it feels like
a peaceful sanctuary

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and they'll just want to
stay there and not leave.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The crystal grids
enhance everything

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.150 align:middle line:90%
that we do within a space.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:14.200 align:middle line:84%
They also make it more
multi-dimensional.

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:84%
With the grid in
place, the space

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:20.875 align:middle line:84%
becomes more alive, more
vibrant, and highly creative.

00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And one thing to keep
in mind is that while we

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.400 align:middle line:84%
can use all types of
crystals for healing,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.640 align:middle line:84%
but when it comes to these
kinds of magical uses,

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.610 align:middle line:84%
such as for dreaming
and grids, we only

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
want to use clear
quartz crystals.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is that clear
quartz channels the pure energy

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:44.580 align:middle line:84%
and amplifies the magic rather
than coloring it in some way.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Clear quartz gives us the pure
connection to the hermetic ray

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and enhances it
without distortion.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.510 align:middle line:84%
This is important for the
magical use of the crystal

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:58.710 align:middle line:84%
to stay true to the
intention that we set.

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned a moment ago using
crystals to enhance our dreams.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.220 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, crystals can help
us connect more strongly

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.420 align:middle line:90%
with our inner guidance.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.484 align:middle line:84%
And they help to thin the veil
so that we can perceive more.

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And when we work with a crystal
right before going to sleep,

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.621 align:middle line:84%
it can really make
our dreams come alive.

00:34:20.621 --> 00:34:24.239 align:middle line:84%
Now for this method, place
a clear quartz crystal

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:28.350 align:middle line:84%
on your third eye for about 20
minutes before going to sleep.

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
You come meditate
with the clear quartz

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.040 align:middle line:84%
crystal on your third eye using
maybe a headband or a bandanna.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you're meditating,
focus on a question

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.239 align:middle line:90%
that you'd like clarity on.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:43.590 align:middle line:84%
After 20 minutes, remove the
crystal before falling asleep.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Be sure to write down
anything that you remember

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.330 align:middle line:84%
from your dreams,
and reflect upon them

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:53.190 align:middle line:84%
so that the new perspective
or insight can be revealed.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.870 align:middle line:84%
When using crystals
for dreaming,

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.500 align:middle line:84%
it's really important to
only use clear quartz.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:84%
Other types of crystals will
likely distort and cause

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.090 align:middle line:90%
weird dreams.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.860 align:middle line:90%
We want our dreams to be clear.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:09.171 align:middle line:84%
So, only use clear quartz
for this technique.

00:35:09.171 --> 00:35:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Now having said
that, we can also

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:15.510 align:middle line:84%
work with a certain type of
crystal called dream quartz.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:18.210 align:middle line:84%
These crystals have a lot
of patterns and inclusions

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:19.500 align:middle line:90%
within them.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.630 align:middle line:84%
When we look into
a dream quartz,

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:26.580 align:middle line:84%
allow your mind to have a loose
sort of just stalled focus.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Observe without focusing
too hard on anything.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But hold a question in your mind
as you look into the crystal.

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Another method is to hold
the crystal in your hand

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:84%
while meditating to connect more
clearly with higher guidance.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.140 align:middle line:84%
One trick to helping us connect
to higher spiritual planes

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and receive the
information more clearly

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.440 align:middle line:90%
is to cool down your crystal.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.700 align:middle line:84%
Place the crystal in
the freezer for a bit

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:84%
to cool it below 66 degrees
Fahrenheit or below 19 degrees

00:35:58.170 --> 00:35:59.520 align:middle line:90%
Celsius.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.690 align:middle line:84%
This helps slow down the
light as it flows through.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And it mediates the
energy so that it's easier

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.480 align:middle line:90%
to connect with.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Also, it makes a
difference which hand

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.460 align:middle line:90%
you're holding the crystal in.

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:16.580 align:middle line:84%
If you want to connect with
information for the future,

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.460 align:middle line:84%
then hold the crystal
in your right hand.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.920 align:middle line:84%
If you want to connect with
information about the past,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.170 align:middle line:90%
then hold it in your left hand.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's important to work
with clear quartz for this

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.360 align:middle line:10%
to bring the information
through with clarity

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:10%
and without distortions.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Working with crystals
is a great way

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:38.360 align:middle line:84%
to access the power of sacred
geometries in our life.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do
with sacred geometry

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is about sanctifying by
bringing sacred energy in

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:48.530 align:middle line:84%
to enhance and amplify
the light in our lives.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:52.820 align:middle line:84%
They help us access more of
our multi-dimensionality.

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:55.160 align:middle line:84%
We can sanctify and
enhance our body

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:90%
for healing and activation.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And we can also sanctify
our environment or the homes

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.320 align:middle line:90%
and the spaces that we work in.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.360 align:middle line:90%
This is the energy of life.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And we can bring
this into our spaces

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:84%
to create a more
life-giving environment.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:84%
We use these tools
and work with crystals

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to bring us more insight,
guidance, healing,

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.960 align:middle line:90%
and enhancement to our life.

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it's up
to us if we choose

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:27.740 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate our relationship
with the mineral kingdom.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.020 align:middle line:84%
We can do this when we treat
crystals like individuals--

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.790 align:middle line:84%
not just as objects, but
honor their sacred energy.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.610 align:middle line:84%
Their pure form is
based on sacred energy.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we treat
them as sacred,

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:44.110 align:middle line:90%
they are happy to support us.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:84%
Crystals flow the
essence of life.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And their purpose is to support
our progression in many ways.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we explore
the alchemy of relationships

00:37:56.350 --> 00:38:00.450 align:middle line:84%
as catalysts for growth
and transformation.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:02.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:05.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring the
mysteries of crystals with me

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:09.050 align:middle line:84%
in this episode of
"Mystery Teachings."
