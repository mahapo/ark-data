00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.120 align:middle line:84%
How do we become more masterful
at manifesting our higher

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.270 align:middle line:90%
purpose and potential?

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, there is truly no
greater goal than this.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.549 align:middle line:84%
It's the great work of
coming to know ourselves

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and expressing our
full potential in life.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
But when we're trying
to accomplish a goal,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:90%
inevitably obstacles come up.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to
reliably overcome

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.540 align:middle line:84%
such challenges in a way
that's aligned with our highest

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:90%
wisdom and purpose?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
The key is to access a higher
expression of creativity coming

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.170 align:middle line:84%
from the one mind of source, but
most of us aren't doing this.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170 align:middle line:84%
The truth is most people
tend to access ideas

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:90%
from things they already know.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes two people even hit on
the same idea at the same time.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.020 align:middle line:84%
There are many past examples
where such occurrence has

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.110 align:middle line:84%
led to debates, accusing
one person of stealing

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.150 align:middle line:90%
someone else's idea.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
But often, they
independently came to it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:90%
around the same time.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.612 align:middle line:90%
How is this possible?

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because we all share
a collective consciousness

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.790 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Ideas don't actually originate
in our individual centers

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They're floating around
within the collective mind,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and anyone with the right
resonance to a particular idea

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:90%
may pick it up.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:84%
There may even be multiple
outlets for an idea

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
to come through,
colored, of course,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
by each person's unique
filter and perspective.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
Reminds me of the
saying that there's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:90%
nothing new under the sun.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's true we're
often just rehashing

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:84%
old ideas with the
new flare to them,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.926 align:middle line:84%
but is there a way to
access truly new ideas?

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:10%
Well, one of the scientists
who played a central role

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.630 align:middle line:10%
in the quantum physics
revolution, Erwin Schroeder

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.020 align:middle line:10%
was once asked how many minds
there were in the universe.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And he responded with a
reference to the Upanishads,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.120 align:middle line:84%
saying, multiplicity is
only a apparent in truth.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%
There is only one mind.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Meaning Schrodinger
was looking even

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
beyond the collective
mind of humanity

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and into the one mind of
the universe or source.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And this source inspired him
with truly innovative ideas

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:84%
and new ways of
looking at things.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So how can we access that
infinite, universal mind

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.370 align:middle line:84%
of the source to gain truly
new insights rather than just

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.400 align:middle line:84%
recycling old ideas from
the collective consciousness

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:90%
of humanity?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this episode, we
dive into practical methods

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.810 align:middle line:84%
for how to do this and learn
the Kabbalistic formula

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:84%
for manifestation known
as the four worlds.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistic cosmology
or creation stories

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
provide us deep insights
into this formula

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:84%
for how all the
creative energies flow

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:84%
from that initial spark
to the final result,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and it goes something like this.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, all was
void and without form.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Everything existed within
a sea of potentiality,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:90%
and yet nothing manifested.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.300 align:middle line:84%
How does that
initial spark come in

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
to create the first
movement toward creation?

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah says that the
infinite source first

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.535 align:middle line:84%
contracted, this source that
the Kabbalists call the einsof.

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:41.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard to define.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything we could say about
it we can also say the opposite.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.020 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere and nowhere.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing happening, and
yet all things are happening.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a sea of potentiality.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So something first needs
to happen to create

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.530 align:middle line:90%
a somewhere from the nowhere.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, the first act of the
end soft was to withdrawal.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
It restricted itself
to make space.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
The 16th century master
Kabbalist rabbi Isaac Luria

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:84%
called this initial act
the primal tzimtzum.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
Now, tzimtzum means
to reduce or contract.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.160 align:middle line:84%
This infinite source withdrew
from a tiny, little point,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
and this became the center of
creation, a reference point.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
it became a vessel

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:84%
into which creation
could come into being.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And we can also call
this the origin.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
This point is the hidden origin
within all sacred geometries.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
It's not a sacred
geometry itself.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
But without this first reference
point, there is no geometry.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So from here enters a
primordial sense of existence.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the "I AM" within
the center of being,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and this is what this
point represents.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
As the light of
the source is then

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
drawn into this first
point, it becomes the top

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:90%
of the Tree of Life, Kether--

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.130 align:middle line:90%
the Crown or the I AM presence.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.780 align:middle line:90%
This single ray of light--

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:84%
that first ray-- then emanates
out into the darkness.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And its direction is driven
by the will of einsof,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.650 align:middle line:84%
moving out towards
expansion and creation.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, similar to
how its described

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
in the alchemical
model, this ray of light

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:84%
divides the prima materia into
the volatile and the fixed--

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.760 align:middle line:84%
or we could say, into the
masculine and the feminine.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.110 align:middle line:84%
We can represent this ray
of light as a single line.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And this becomes the
second geometric principle,

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.800 align:middle line:84%
expanding from a
point to a line.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.960 align:middle line:84%
But this line is
more like a vector,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.170 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's extending or
moving outward with a force.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And in physics, this
is the Big Bang moment,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
is that outward expression
moving into all directions,

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.082 align:middle line:84%
and it's defined by the
radius of expansion.

00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, this creates the second
point the Tree of Life.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And that second point is
Hokhmah, which means "wisdom."

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's an outward
moving force,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.335 align:middle line:84%
driven by the will of
the divine to create.

00:06:24.335 --> 00:06:26.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But we can't just
have expansion.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, because nothing will
be formed if there's only

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:90%
expansion out infinitely.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Thus, at the same time
as the light expands out,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.890 align:middle line:84%
there must also be another
aspect to balance it.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:84%
Remember, as the first ray was
sent out into the darkness,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
it divided the prima into
masculine and feminine aspects.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
There must be both
outward-moving and

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.776 align:middle line:84%
inward-moving forces that
cooperate to create form.

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Now this gives us,
then, the third point

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.000 align:middle line:84%
of the Tree of Life, Binah,
which means "understanding."

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.670 align:middle line:84%
And Binah is the
contractive, formative aspect

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.440 align:middle line:84%
the gives the light and
life force a container.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:10%
Now we have these
three points, forming

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:10%
the upper triangle, which is
the first true sacred geometry.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And with this third point, we
now also have dimensionality,

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.990 align:middle line:84%
which coincides with
space time being

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
generated as a container
for the universe

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.978 align:middle line:90%
to be formed inside of.

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sequence becomes the
original pattern of creation

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:90%
from source.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.030 align:middle line:10%
It starts with the one
splitting into the two,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:10%
which then forms a triad.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:10%
And in the
Kabbalistic teachings,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.380 align:middle line:10%
now we have a
pattern that works.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:10%
We have the essential
components that are all needed

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:10%
and all moving
towards manifestation.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:10%
In Kabbalah, we call
this first triad Atziluth

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.960 align:middle line:10%
It's the first
world of creation,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:10%
the world of the divine.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.980 align:middle line:84%
It's an archetypal
world, meaning

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.890 align:middle line:84%
it's at the highest
divine plane,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and it holds the
original blueprint

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.170 align:middle line:84%
that all things can
be created off of.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.970 align:middle line:84%
On this world, primordial
universes can see and hear.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.390 align:middle line:84%
It's more like an idea
in the divine mind

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.120 align:middle line:84%
to bring that
universe into being.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
So the very purpose
or the original intent

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is contained here in this
archetypal world of Atziluth

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:84%
But it's at such a high
frequency level high up

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.600 align:middle line:84%
in the ethers, and
it's not anywhere near

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:90%
its ultimate expression.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just an inkling of
an idea, as the divine

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.360 align:middle line:84%
starts to express itself from
the realm of potentiality

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:90%
into actuality.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:84%
How does this process
move forward from here?

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, now that we
have this first form,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:84%
we have a foundation
to work from.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:90%
We have a blueprint.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.110 align:middle line:84%
From a sacred
geometry perspective,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.500 align:middle line:84%
the most efficient way
to continue the process

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is to take this form
and duplicate it.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, how do we do that?

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, we go to the edge of
that on the slope of expansion

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and project a copy of this
form across that edge.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So the upright triangle is
replicated into a mirror image,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
forming a downward triangle,
as the divine then pushes

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:90%
its light out even further.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's taking what
works and duplicating it.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're made in
the image of the divine.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us now
into the world of Beri'ah,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:90%
the second of the four worlds.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:84%
It's what we call
the creative world.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, creation is really
starting to move here.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And that original intent
of the divine mind

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.370 align:middle line:84%
comes into this realm, where
it can be seen as a vision

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:90%
and reflected upon.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Before it was an inkling
with some purpose behind it,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:90%
but now it becomes clarified.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
The first world is the divine
will to create and express,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.790 align:middle line:84%
so how does that now translate
into the second world?

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, here we move from the
highest archetypal world

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:90%
into an expressive world.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of
creative energy flows

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
towards clarifying this
vision and setting forces

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.430 align:middle line:90%
in motion to fulfill it.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this world
of Beri'ah, we

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.350 align:middle line:84%
talk about it as being
the realm of archangels

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:34.630 align:middle line:84%
and the various gods and
goddesses of creation

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
mythologies from
around the world.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:84%
All the bodhisattvas
and [? Monas ?]

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.182 align:middle line:90%
exist within this realm.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And our individuated
spirits are also

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.790 align:middle line:84%
emanated out from the oneness
here, the one expressing itself

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.730 align:middle line:90%
through the many.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Those top three points
of the upper triad

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
that are duplicated into
this world of Beri'ah

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:84%
are known as Hesed,
Gevurah, and Tiferet.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.450 align:middle line:84%
This triad, again, utilizes
the masculine and feminine

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.960 align:middle line:84%
interplay of expansion
and contraction--

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.630 align:middle line:84%
this time, to bring the
vision into perfection.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, by
expanding the vision

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
through all possibilities,
looking at it from all angles.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like a major brainstorming
session, playing out

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
all the scenarios
and the options.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:84%
But then it must also be
contracted cutting out

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
any options that will not be
useful in achieving that goal.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.230 align:middle line:84%
So we have to focus in on
what aspects hold the highest

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:84%
potential for manifesting
the original idea

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
in its purest form,
expanding and contracting

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.420 align:middle line:84%
until it solidifies into
a clear vision of what's

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:90%
to be manifested.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:84%
We call this the
realm of thought,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
which is different from
the realm of ideas.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Ideas are precognitive,
meaning it's just an inkling.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It's beyond the tip
of our awareness,

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:84%
but thoughts are more clarified
and able to be contemplated

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.004 align:middle line:90%
upon.

00:12:07.004 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, what continues to drive
this process of creation

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:90%
forward is love and devotion.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we associate this
world with the divine heart

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:90%
rather than the mind.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Courage, strength, and
discipline also come in here

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
in order to make sure
that only that which

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:84%
serves the great work will
really continue on from here.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of what's
been described so far

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.485 align:middle line:84%
is happening at a very
high, celestial level--

00:12:34.485 --> 00:12:37.300 align:middle line:90%
a higher state of consciousness.

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
So again, it needs to come
down into a more tangible level

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.240 align:middle line:90%
in order to manifest.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:90%
So what happens next?

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.180 align:middle line:84%
The divine again replicates
or projects its form

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:84%
down into a denser
level, thus duplicating

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:84%
that downward
triangle once again.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:84%
This produces the third
world, known as Yetzirah,

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:02.470 align:middle line:84%
anchoring the spheres of
Netsah, Hod, and Yesod.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Yetzirah is known as
the formative world.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Now the creation
process is able to come

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.800 align:middle line:84%
into more concrete
forms, and this world

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.990 align:middle line:84%
gives us a much more
developed matrix for creation.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Now we have all the materia
and the forces needed,

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
and everything has
been made distinct.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So all the essential
ingredients are present here.

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
at this stage is

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:84%
to now take those ingredients
and put them together

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:90%
into a recipe or plan.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:90%
How do we create the recipes?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are the plans or
the blueprints for creation.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And here, we figure
out all the details,

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
measuring how much, the timing,
exact proportions everything

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
that's needed to create
whatever it is that's

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:90%
going to be manifested.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:84%
So in the world of
Yetzirah, things

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:84%
become much more
specific and measurable.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And also, at this
level of creation,

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.230 align:middle line:84%
there are a host
of angelic beings

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.000 align:middle line:84%
that work to fulfill
the divine will.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.180 align:middle line:84%
They're considered the
builders of creation.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.320 align:middle line:10%
Now, this formative
world has also

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:10%
been called the astral plane,
the etheric scaffolding

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:10%
behind the physical, and where
the machinery of the universe

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.450 align:middle line:10%
operates.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:84%
What runs and supports
the physical universe

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
is all constructed
and orchestrated here.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:84%
This is where mental forces
establish plans and set them

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.710 align:middle line:90%
in motion.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Within our creative
process, this

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.520 align:middle line:84%
is where we get to
create those blueprints

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
with precise instructions
to be followed step-by-step

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:84%
in order to accomplish a
goal in the material realm.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We've gathered the ingredients
and devised a clear strategy

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.520 align:middle line:90%
for bringing it all together.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And now that we have
the recipe, there's

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:90%
only one thing left to do.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.700 align:middle line:90%
It's time to take action.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
creative processes

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:84%
happening in all
those higher worlds,

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:84%
they all get funneled down
into action to be manifested.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:10%
As long as the recipes in the
blueprints are clear and true,

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:10%
all we need to do is now
follow through and manifest.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.300 align:middle line:10%
And this final world consists
of just one sphere on the tree

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:10%
because it's just one thing
that we need to do, act.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.440 align:middle line:10%
This is the sphere of
Malchut, the physical kingdom.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.960 align:middle line:10%
This is where we live in the
cycle of life and manifest

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:10%
ideas, thoughts, and plans.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
The higher spheres bring
masculine and feminine energies

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
together to create, and
now it's time to manifest.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And this fourth world is called
Assiah, the world of action

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.100 align:middle line:90%
and physical manifestation.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.660 align:middle line:84%
Everything we know about the
physical universe exists here.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We're here to experience
and create in this realm,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
to be a part of the great work,
to co-create with the divine

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
into this physical
manifestation.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So we are the beings that
operate at this level

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to follow those creative
ideas and energies down

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.250 align:middle line:90%
into their final form.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
When we do this in alignment
with the divine will,

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:middle line:90%
all is good.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
But when we're out
of alignment, that

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.290 align:middle line:90%
is when things go sideways.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.060 align:middle line:84%
In the world we've
manifested, we

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:84%
see a lot of corruption and
distortion, unfortunately.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
The truth is we block the flow
of light within our minds.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:84%
We have access to
all four worlds.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:90%
It's all in our DNA.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
It's how our mind is
supposed to work naturally,

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.720 align:middle line:84%
and we're meant
to be manifesting

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:90%
world of beauty and harmony.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But because of
programming, traumas,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.460 align:middle line:84%
and mistakes made by
us and our ancestors,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
we've become blocked
in our ability

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.566 align:middle line:84%
to access all four
worlds with ease.

00:16:55.566 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, where do we tend to get
stuck in this creative process?

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's different
for different people,

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
but to here are some of the
general patterns that we see.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people are really good at
taking action and seeing things

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.140 align:middle line:90%
through to make them happen.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.960 align:middle line:84%
These are grounded
and practical people.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.790 align:middle line:84%
They operate
primarily in the world

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
of Assiah, the realm of
physicality and action.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But they might not be so good
at accessing the higher world,

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.109 align:middle line:84%
where creative ideas
are sourced from.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps they rely on other
people to create the ideas

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.090 align:middle line:84%
and plans, and then
they step in when

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:35.770 align:middle line:84%
it's time to implement
and produce results.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
Then there are people
who are good at action,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
but where they really shine
is in the planning process.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
These are the ones who
dot all the I's and cross

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
all the T's, and they're
good at paying attention

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:90%
to the details.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They might enjoy solving
puzzles and figuring out

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:90%
how to make things work.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.930 align:middle line:84%
But the sticking points
here might be coming up

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.900 align:middle line:84%
with truly innovative
ideas and approaches

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
versus following
textbook protocols.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.600 align:middle line:84%
They might have to rely
upon outside influences

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.360 align:middle line:90%
to give them ideas to run with.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:84%
These people primarily operate
in that realm of Yetzirah,

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:90%
or planning.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:84%
They may be good at
making things happen,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:19.270 align:middle line:84%
but the visionary level often
remains out of reach to them.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Then there are those who are
good at getting that vision

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
and they tap into
that flow creativity,

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and then they might also
be good at planning,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.130 align:middle line:84%
but they fall into
perfectionistic traps.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Perfectionists try to
think of everything,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.940 align:middle line:84%
looking at the projects
from every possible angle.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And they plan, and they
plan, and they plan,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.350 align:middle line:90%
and they keep planning.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And they look at every
scenario and think

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.260 align:middle line:84%
that plan has to be perfect
before taking action.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And hence, they stop the
flow because of their fears

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and attachments that
it's not perfect.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we just need
to take action, and then

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:00.290 align:middle line:84%
refine, and adjust, and learn
from our mistakes as we go.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
Then there are the
visionaries, the people

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
who usually have an abundance
of ideas flowing through.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
They're able to tap
into this creative field

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:90%
from the realm of Beri'ah.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:84%
They access those big
ideas and visions,

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:84%
and have great
suggestions for people,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and are able to inspire
others with their excitement

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:90%
and passion.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But often, these creative types
have so many ideas coming in

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that they tend to bounce
from one idea to the next.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And they may lack the
patience and discipline

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
for that linear way of working
with timelines, budgets,

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and all of the structure
that's needed to organize

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:90%
and implement the vision.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.410 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather tap into the
ideas and hold the vision,

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and then delegate to
others to make it happen.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
They're working in
the creative world,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.350 align:middle line:84%
but relying on a team to work
the energies in the lower

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.690 align:middle line:90%
worlds.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
there are the mystics.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
These are people who are able
to raise their consciousness up

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
into that oneness
with the divine mind

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:90%
and be filled by the spirit.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
They're also visionaries,
but their visions usually

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:10.550 align:middle line:84%
take on a more global
and mystical or spiritual

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:84%
nature, inspired by
the realm of Atziluth.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
hold these vibrations

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:84%
while also being in the
world of practicality.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.470 align:middle line:10%
And that's why most mystics
are hermits, monks, or nuns

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.080 align:middle line:10%
who live away from society.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.090 align:middle line:84%
They rely on their
students or devotees

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
to help carry out the
visions and inspirations

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.090 align:middle line:84%
that they transmit from
the spiritual realms.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of us are working in
at least one of these levels

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.071 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes a
combination of them.

00:20:42.071 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And what Kabbalah
trains us to do

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.270 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to access
all four of these realms

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and have equal mastery
of each of them--

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to flow light
down from that highest,

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:84%
divine source and flow
it through the mind

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to create a vision, plans,
and then take action.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether we're the
ones taking the action

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:84%
or we're managing a team,
it's all being manifested

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and we're guiding the
process from start to finish.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But we need access
to all four levels

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.390 align:middle line:84%
to know how things
operate and to be

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:19.080 align:middle line:84%
able to master this
process of manifestation.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is our birthright.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.990 align:middle line:84%
It's what we're meant
to be able to do.

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:27.210 align:middle line:84%
But without having a
dedicated spiritual practice

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
and going through the process
of building your bridge

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:84%
to reconnect to
that divine mind,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to truly tap into
that world of Atziluth.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.870 align:middle line:84%
In universal Kabbalah, we have
the tools to build that bridge

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and raise our mind up to that
realm of unity consciousness.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is key to tap into
that divine realm of creation

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.920 align:middle line:90%
in Atziluth.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Here, we tap into
superconsciousness, which is

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.280 align:middle line:90%
beyond our ability to express.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And when we can start tapping
into this highest realm

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and bring it in through
the four worlds,

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that's when we'll
get back on track

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:09.030 align:middle line:84%
with manifesting a world of
beauty, balance, and light.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
We can create a world that
truly reflects heaven on Earth.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Until then, we're simply
recycling old ideas

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and shuffling things
around with a new twist

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
rather than ideas that
are truly new from source.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:84%
This is what we want
to break through.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And when we, as individuals,
master the four worlds,

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.790 align:middle line:84%
we can finally create the
life we're meant to be living.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:84%
What methods can
we use to access

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
these four worlds to improve
on our ability to manifest?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we look at
the tree of life,

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of sacred
geometry, we've

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.920 align:middle line:84%
already established how
the very top is represented

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.500 align:middle line:90%
by the upright triangle.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
One method, therefore,
for accessing this highest

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:00.070 align:middle line:84%
archetypal realm is to work
with the upright triangle

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:90%
as a symbol.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:04.690 align:middle line:84%
For example,
visualize the triangle

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:10.150 align:middle line:84%
in front of your third eye
and hold that focus point.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Or if we're working with a
three dimensional tree of life,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.510 align:middle line:90%
the triangle becomes a pyramid.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
Visualize the base of
the pyramid resting

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
on your shoulders,
with your head

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:90%
immersed inside the pyramid.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Or you can also visualize your
whole being inside the pyramid,

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and the divine light
coming in from above.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.670 align:middle line:84%
These are good tools and symbols
to help us access that highest

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.036 align:middle line:90%
realm of archetypal ideas.

00:23:39.036 --> 00:23:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And within the pyramid
an inkling of an idea

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:84%
may start to come in, but it
remains just beyond reach.

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to grasp
exactly what it is here

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:90%
because it's superconscious.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But you can feel the
energy coming in.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
It may feel inspiring
and uplifting.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And you might not have
clarity of what it is yet,

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.940 align:middle line:84%
but you're starting
to access the energy.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:84%
As you feel the
energy coming in,

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
continue this visualization
in the pyramid

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
until the energy
becomes saturated.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.130 align:middle line:84%
And then we want to slow it down
to come into the next around,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:90%
the realm of Beri'ah.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And when looking at the Tree of
Life, the middle two worlds--

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
or the two downward triangles--
together, form a square.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Or when looked at
three-dimensionally,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:84%
we see a cube on
the tree of life.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So the square or the
cube are good symbols

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.530 align:middle line:84%
for working with the realms
of Beri'ah and Yetzirah.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Imagine shifting from the
pyramid down into a cube

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:90%
beneath the pyramid.

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:84%
In Beri'ah, we work with
the upper half of the cube.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
So just float in the top
half of the cube for now.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And as we later than
shift into Yetzirah,

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:07.730 align:middle line:84%
we'll work with the
lower half of the cube.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, the cube has six
faces and 12 edges,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.000 align:middle line:84%
numbers we'll also
use in this process.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Beri'ah is the realm of
thoughts and brainstorming.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
So here, let's work
with the number 6

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and try to identify six
different perspectives

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
or viewpoints to help bring that
inkling into greater clarity.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Think of the center of the
cube as containing the vision

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.280 align:middle line:84%
or idea that you want
to clarify, and then

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:84%
look at it from six different
angles or directions--

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.180 align:middle line:84%
from above, below,
from in front,

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:90%
behind, the right, and the left.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Literally move your
viewpoint around the cube

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:55.765 align:middle line:84%
as you inspect the vision
that is forming in the center.

00:25:55.765 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:02.070 align:middle line:84%
New thoughts will come in
to clarify what this is

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and help you flesh it out until
it becomes a very clear vision.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the process,
continue looking

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
for at least six
aspects or perspectives

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:14.010 align:middle line:90%
to create this vision.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:84%
We can ask, what does it look
like from this direction?

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.690 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.460 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:84%
What are all the possibilities,
and which ones are

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.980 align:middle line:90%
going to be the most effective?

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.340 align:middle line:90%
How can we make it practical?

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.110 align:middle line:90%
Brainstorm here.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Expand all of the possibilities
without filtering anything

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.580 align:middle line:90%
out just yet.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And then once
you've brainstormed,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.720 align:middle line:84%
then you can start to
contract it by asking,

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.220 align:middle line:84%
which options will lead to
the best possible outcomes,

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and which ones
resonate the most?

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Eliminate anything unnecessary
until you come to the best form

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.120 align:middle line:84%
and can really
solidify the vision.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.240 align:middle line:84%
Dial it in to the point
where you feel really excited

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.450 align:middle line:90%
about it and clear.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You want to feel that it's
a worthy vision to follow,

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and there's a sense
of devotion to it,

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.860 align:middle line:84%
along with joy and
excitement about it.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:84%
The heart really
needs to feel it

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.690 align:middle line:84%
before we move into
the planning phase.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:19.995 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:19.995 --> 00:27:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But once the vision
has solidified

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:84%
and you're ready to figure
out how to make it happen,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.390 align:middle line:84%
imagine now moving down
to the base of the cube.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.230 align:middle line:84%
This moves us into the world of
Yetzirah, the formative world,

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:middle line:90%
where we start planning.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And a good plan is
far more detailed.

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah we talk about
there being twice as much

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.710 align:middle line:84%
effort, time, and detail
in the planning stage

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.290 align:middle line:84%
as compared with the
brainstorming or visioning

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.830 align:middle line:90%
stage.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So here, we want to now look
for 12 aspects to this plan.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And for each of
those 12 aspects,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:90%
we want to develop them further.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.730 align:middle line:84%
This can include
timelines, the people

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:84%
involved, budget, specific,
measurable goals and milestones

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.330 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish along the way.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.280 align:middle line:84%
All of the details
that are needed

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:84%
to bring that vision into
reality come in here.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Later, you can mine map
it out by drawing the cube

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and, on the six faces, write
the major categories or aspects

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.200 align:middle line:90%
of the vision.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And then on the 12
edges of the cube,

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:31.210 align:middle line:84%
write out the 12 major
components of the plan.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's really cool about
this is that we're not only

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
using it as a method for
accessing the four worlds,

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.520 align:middle line:84%
but this is literally creating
an energetic structure

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.420 align:middle line:90%
within our mind.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.360 align:middle line:84%
The mind directs the
creative process.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So this cube becomes a
container for all the energies

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to flow into and support
our manifestation.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.690 align:middle line:84%
This is ultimately what the
cube represents and Kabbalah,

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:90%
a container for creation.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And this cube of creation
is a very deep study

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.740 align:middle line:84%
within the
Kabbalistic tradition.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.120 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid floats above it,
but all of that creative work

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.110 align:middle line:84%
is happening here in the
mind and within the cube.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:84%
All the structures
and the blueprints

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
are contained here in
the cube the cube is just

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:84%
as important in Kabbalah
as the Tree of Life is.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a very powerful
symbol to work with

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:29.850 align:middle line:84%
to support your
creative process.

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's not take it for granted.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.530 align:middle line:10%
Now, with all of these
exotic, sacred geometries

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.200 align:middle line:10%
like the flower of life,
and the Fibonacci spirals,

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.960 align:middle line:10%
and so on, it's so
easy to overlook

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:10%
the power of the foundational
principles of sacred geometry

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:48.300 align:middle line:10%
that rest upon the pyramid,
the cube, and the sphere.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.965 align:middle line:84%
All of those more exotic forms
are built upon these three,

00:29:52.965 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and these forms are
essential for helping

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:84%
us to access the most
fundamental aspects

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So here, in this planning
stage, while looking

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
at the 12 major aspects of
your plan, set clear goals.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.940 align:middle line:84%
You can think of smart
goals that are specific,

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.380 align:middle line:84%
measurable to track so we can
see if we're making progress,

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.590 align:middle line:84%
attainable or
realistic, relevant--

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:84%
meaning the goal is supporting
the overall vision--

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.630 align:middle line:90%
and, finally, time based--

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:84%
committing the
exact time and date

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
into our schedule to follow
through on each step,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:84%
meaning set dates for
when the goals need

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to be accomplished
by, including when

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.760 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take action
towards accomplishing them.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's important
to point out that once

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.650 align:middle line:84%
the schedules in place, if we
don't meet those deadlines,

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:90%
that doesn't mean we failed.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:90%
We're aiming for those dates.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But if we need to readjust
our plan or schedule,

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.400 align:middle line:90%
we can do that as we go.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.950 align:middle line:84%
This gets us moving
forward, and we

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.790 align:middle line:84%
need to be flexible as
we move into action.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:02.015 align:middle line:84%
These are all part of
the planning stage,

00:31:02.015 --> 00:31:03.390 align:middle line:84%
and it's a good
guideline to help

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:84%
us know whether a plan
is complete enough

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.080 align:middle line:90%
to take the next steps.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We want to see all
the major steps

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.370 align:middle line:84%
that we need to follow
in order to bring

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:90%
our vision into full fruition.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Finally, this brings us into
that final World of Assiah,

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:90%
the realm of action.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.880 align:middle line:84%
This final step is
represented by the sphere.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.370 align:middle line:84%
So now imagine bringing
all of that energy

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:31.850 align:middle line:84%
down from the cube
into the sphere.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.010 align:middle line:84%
I also like to set
that sphere in motion,

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:38.375 align:middle line:84%
imagining it rotating clockwise
around me as seen from above.

00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And this movement creates
momentum and sets forces

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.100 align:middle line:90%
in motion.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:84%
It's also good to see the
energies congealing into it

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.190 align:middle line:84%
to form a more solid
form, like what

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.250 align:middle line:84%
happens when a liquid
crystallizes into a lattice

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.910 align:middle line:90%
structure.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:58.680 align:middle line:84%
Feel it, visualize it, and
see yourself taking the action

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.940 align:middle line:90%
steps.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Hear the positive words the
people are saying to you,

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
and celebrate the success of
having accomplished your goals

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.540 align:middle line:90%
and fulfill that vision.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:90%
Taste the victory.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Do all of this
within the sphere,

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and envision the whole process
as if it's already done.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Use the law of attraction
here at this final stage,

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and get a visceral
feeling in your body

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:84%
of how it feels to take
action and achieve victory.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
As you come out of
the meditation state,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.920 align:middle line:84%
write or mind map
everything out.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Schedule steps out
into your calendar,

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and start taking
those action steps.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.350 align:middle line:84%
At its core essence, the four
worlds are really simple--

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:90%
idea, thought, plan, action.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:84%
This is how our mind
works, or at least

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.310 align:middle line:84%
that's how it's
supposed to work.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.460 align:middle line:84%
This is how all things
become manifested.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And what I've shared
here is just one example

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of how we work with the
four worlds in Kabbalah

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:84%
to master this process
of manifestation.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there
are more methods

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.200 align:middle line:84%
we learned through Kabbalah,
but this is a good foundation

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.670 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.440 align:middle line:84%
The more advanced
forms of meditation

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.570 align:middle line:84%
invoke certain
divine names of power

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.570 align:middle line:84%
to support us with
the creative process,

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.000 align:middle line:84%
but these are things that
should be handed down directly

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.280 align:middle line:90%
through in-person training.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.890 align:middle line:84%
These tools help us to
access higher energies

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:27.530 align:middle line:84%
in a powerful way
not just to create

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:84%
from our own mind and
our own abilities,

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:33.020 align:middle line:84%
but also to co-create
with spirit,

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.660 align:middle line:84%
to engage the archetypal
forces in a way that's

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.570 align:middle line:84%
magical and powerful
so we can create

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.810 align:middle line:84%
something that's better than
what we could have imagined.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.760 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.270 align:middle line:84%
When we're co-creating with
spirit, what we can accomplish

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.700 align:middle line:90%
seems almost miraculous.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.195 align:middle line:84%
It defies logic and what
we think is possible.

00:33:53.195 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And to access real
magic, we first

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:59.510 align:middle line:84%
need to learn how to
harness our mind better.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.220 align:middle line:84%
These tools I've
shared with you here

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.620 align:middle line:90%
will help you do just that.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:84%
They help bring our minds to
a more multi-dimensional way

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.360 align:middle line:90%
of thinking.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.850 align:middle line:84%
They also help organize
our mind and provide us

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:13.909 align:middle line:84%
with the right
keys for creation.

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:17.030 align:middle line:84%
If everything in our
blueprints, mind and soul,

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:20.330 align:middle line:84%
was working in clear
and perfect order,

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.639 align:middle line:84%
then our manifestation
process would just

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.739 align:middle line:90%
be an automatic flow.

00:34:24.739 --> 00:34:27.469 align:middle line:84%
It would be effortless,
and we'd automatically

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:90%
be manifesting in a clear way.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.889 align:middle line:84%
The light would flow
through unimpeded.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Manifestation should
become that easy,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.219 align:middle line:84%
but it's not easy because
we have distortions, blocks,

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:43.820 align:middle line:84%
or cracks in our pattern
of the Tree of Life.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:49.020 align:middle line:84%
These take us from a pure
state into what we have today,

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and it's what's getting in the
way of creating a world that's

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:90%
aligned with divine will.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So the other thing we do
in the Kabbalistic process

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.800 align:middle line:84%
to gain greater mastery
is to clear all of this

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.190 align:middle line:84%
up, to repair our
vessels, and restore

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:08.480 align:middle line:84%
the pattern of our Tree of
Life to its original integrity.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can accelerate
this process

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.220 align:middle line:84%
by ascending the Tree
of Life, ascending

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.550 align:middle line:84%
from where we're at in the
physical matrix way of life

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:19.280 align:middle line:90%
up to reclaiming our divinity.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we delve
into the process of ascending

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.160 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life and the
journey of reclaiming

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.920 align:middle line:90%
our full potential.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring the
mysteries of manifestation

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.470 align:middle line:84%
with me in this episode
of "Mystery Teachings."
