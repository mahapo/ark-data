00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:10%
One of the greatest catalysts
for growth and transformation

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:10%
in our lives comes
through our relationships.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.590 align:middle line:10%
How is it that relationships
have such an effect on us?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we explore
the underlying dynamics

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
of what I call
"relationship alchemy."

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:84%
There is both an
art and a science

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to building synergistic
relationships

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and is some of the
biggest challenges

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%
we encounter in our lives.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940 align:middle line:84%
That's because we humans
are social creatures,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and yet, we also have
all of our flaws,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.680 align:middle line:84%
attachments, and
egos to contend with.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We both love and
despise each other.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:90%
We uplift and we tear down.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we can really
grate on each other's nerves,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.720 align:middle line:84%
while other times, we help each
other feel safe and cared for.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's shocking to see
how quickly these feelings

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and dynamics can
shift from one end

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
of the spectrum to the
other, sometimes overnight.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.240 align:middle line:84%
How can we gain greater mastery
in this aspect of our lives?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, for starters, there's
nothing like the relationships

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.730 align:middle line:84%
in our lives to really
show us where we still

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.830 align:middle line:90%
need to work on ourselves.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.230 align:middle line:84%
The people in our lives
are mirrors for us

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:90%
to see ourselves.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, most people
don't want to see themselves.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 align:middle line:84%
So rather than own
their own stuff,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.270 align:middle line:90%
they project it onto others.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.730 align:middle line:10%
If we could just
shift this one thing

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:10%
and start seeing the
people in our lives

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.230 align:middle line:10%
as reflections of
ourselves, it would

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:10%
make a world of difference.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Stop pointing the
finger out there

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and start looking in here.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:84%
When we do, our relationships
become powerful catalysts

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
for healing and
transformation in our lives.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to the
process of transformation,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.490 align:middle line:84%
there's some
fundamental archetypal

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
and alchemical energies
that we want to be aware of.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Understanding the
alchemy of relationships

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
is about helping
us come together

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.370 align:middle line:84%
with others in such a way that
we can co-create something

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.490 align:middle line:84%
better than what we
can do on our own.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.670 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding synergy,
even amidst the tension

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:90%
and differences of opinion.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Just because we don't get
along with someone on our team

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
or in our life, it doesn't
mean we should resist them

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.990 align:middle line:90%
or that they're wrong.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Instead, figure out how to use
the tension and redirect it.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Learn how to harmonize the
energy so that they can be

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:90%
channeled in a good way.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that, we
have to shift our own position

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.360 align:middle line:84%
and rise to a
higher perspective.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what relationship
alchemy is all about.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
It's about harnessing
the tension of opposites

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
or differences and finding ways
to harmonize those differences,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
rather than experiencing
conflict from them.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Before we go much
further, let's get

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
clear on what the term "alchemy"
is as it's being used here.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
What is this alchemy
we're talking about?

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Is it about turning lead into
gold, as is often portrayed?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Not exactly.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:84%
This ancient system
is very misunderstood

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:90%
within the scientific community.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:90%
It's been dismissed and ignored.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
But the true roots of
alchemy reveal a rich system

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
for understanding the forces
of creation and transformation.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Through alchemy, we
can learn to harness

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:84%
these energies to accelerate
our progression as individuals

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:90%
and as a society.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
I see alchemy as the
epitome of integrating

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
science, metaphysics, and
consciousness together.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the art and science
of transformation

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:90%
and transmutation.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Or in other words, of changing
something into something

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:90%
else that's even better.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Some of the most innovative
scientists were alchemists.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.180 align:middle line:10%
People like Isaac Newton,
Roger Bacon, Francis Bacon,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:10%
Leonardo da Vinci, Robert
Boyle, Paracelsus, Nikola Tesla,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:10%
and Wolfgang Pauli.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.050 align:middle line:84%
They all studied and
were inspired by alchemy.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And most of our
modern day sciences

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.020 align:middle line:84%
were developed out of the
ancient traditions of alchemy,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.080 align:middle line:84%
including physics, chemistry,
astronomy, biology,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
allopathic medicine,
pharmacology, psychology,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and many holistic
health practices.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.580 align:middle line:10%
Where modern science has taken
a purely materialist approach,

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:10%
alchemy is intimately
connected to the philosophies

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:10%
of hermeticism, mythology,
and spirituality.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:10%
Not only does alchemy
hold the secrets

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:10%
to understanding and harnessing
this process of transformation

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:10%
at many different
levels, but I believe

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:10%
it's also the key to bridging
the fields of science, spirit,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:10%
and consciousness, again,
in a very practical way.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply alchemy
to relationships?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard the expression,
"opposites attract."

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And the alchemical
process is driven

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:84%
by the interaction and sometimes
the tension that arises

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.110 align:middle line:90%
between different things.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.340 align:middle line:84%
We know in chemistry,
for example,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
if we have two containers
with the same chemical

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and we mix them
together, what happens?

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's no reaction.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
We just end up with
more of the same.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:84%
But if you take two
chemicals that are different

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
and mix them together,
a chemical reaction

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:90%
starts to happen.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And out of that reaction,
something entirely new

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:84%
can result. With
relationship alchemy,

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:84%
it's about bringing
together different people

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.450 align:middle line:84%
to create something
beyond what any of us

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:90%
can create on our own.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
It's through the interaction
of these different essences

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
that something new
can be generated.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.590 align:middle line:84%
What are these
different energies

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that we're working
with in relationships?

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:10%
Well, whether we're
talking about relationships

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:10%
or any type of
transformational process,

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:10%
the process of
creation is driven

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:10%
by the interplay of masculine
and feminine energies.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.200 align:middle line:84%
These two poles of energy are
at the heart of all creation

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.510 align:middle line:90%
and manifestation.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
The seven hermetic principles
describe this dynamic

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.030 align:middle line:90%
as the "principle of gender."

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.270 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Gender
is in everything.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Everything has its masculine
and feminine principles.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Gender manifests on all planes."

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Together, these two energies
are the most powerful forces

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.610 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Relationship alchemy
is specifically

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
about bringing together
masculine and feminine energies

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:90%
to create.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Now when we say "masculine"
and "feminine" here,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:84%
we don't mean a physical
gender necessarily,

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:90%
like a man or a woman.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about energy.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
What exactly is masculine
and feminine energy?

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:90%
How does this work in our lives?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, within each
person and every thing

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
is a mix of these two energies
in different proportions.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
We all have masculine
and feminine energies,

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.060 align:middle line:84%
but we'll be dominant
in one or the other.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to creating
something as an individual

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:84%
or in relationships,
this alchemy

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of masculine and feminine
energies is important.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
We want to have good chemistry
with the people in our lives,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's true
whether they're

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
our friends, our colleagues,
teammates, family members,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:90%
or romantic partnerships.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
What we must
realize is that they

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.940 align:middle line:84%
are going to have a different
mixture of these energies

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:90%
than we do.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.930 align:middle line:84%
What we're looking
for are relationships

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:84%
with people whose energetic
makeup complements our own.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
By complementary, we
don't mean the same.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.500 align:middle line:84%
But rather, they bring
in different elements

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.540 align:middle line:84%
that interact with our mix of
energy in a synergistic way.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The resulting reaction
produces something new,

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's beyond what we
could achieve on our own.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they might
grate against us

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're
different, but this

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
is where the alchemy
can come in to help

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:84%
us harmonize the tension and use
it to generate something new.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
To get a better idea of
the nature of these two

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.870 align:middle line:84%
energies, masculine
and feminine,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at the
alchemical creation story.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.180 align:middle line:84%
To get there, we have to go
way back to the very beginning,

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.030 align:middle line:90%
to the prima materia.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.570 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, before
anything was manifested,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.470 align:middle line:84%
the prima materia was
like a watery chaos.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Everything was
contained within it.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.590 align:middle line:84%
All the raw material that
was needed for creation.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a vast
sea of potentiality.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.510 align:middle line:84%
But it was in a state
of disorder, a chaos.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
All opposites were
contained within it,

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.410 align:middle line:84%
and they were this boiling
and writhing sea of potential.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.500 align:middle line:84%
It reminds me of
the quantum sea--

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:84%
a dynamic flux of quantum
possibilities, yet nothing

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:33.170 align:middle line:90%
actually popping out of it.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So all opposites, all
materia, everything

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that can come into creation
is there in the prima materia,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:44.800 align:middle line:84%
but nothing is
coming out of it yet.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.960 align:middle line:90%
What needs to happen?

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't anything manifesting?

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order for
anything to manifest,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
we need a catalyst to
start the reaction.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.300 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalistic
teachings, it says

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
that the limitless
source, or Ein Sof, which

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
transcends the prima
materia, sends out

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
a single ray of light.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It was that moment of
"let there be light"

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
that separated the
darkness from the light.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.800 align:middle line:84%
In the hermetica, it
states that, "In the deep,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.750 align:middle line:84%
there was boundless darkness,
and water, and fine intelligent

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:28.750 align:middle line:84%
spirit, all existing by
divine power in chaos.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Then a holy light
was sent forth,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and elements solidified
out of liquid essence."

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.730 align:middle line:84%
This divine power was
Ein Sof, the source.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.640 align:middle line:84%
And that holy light that
emanated from the source

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.680 align:middle line:84%
catalyzed things to
start materializing out

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.960 align:middle line:90%
of the quantum sea.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Now in the traditional
alchemical model,

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
it says that the light first
split the prima materia

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:90%
into two.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And that first
division separated

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.570 align:middle line:84%
what we call the "volatile"
from the "fixed."

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.140 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
What is volatile
and what is fixed?

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, volatile is
what we would consider

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.380 align:middle line:90%
more of a masculine energy.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.020 align:middle line:90%
It's reactive and explosive.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.320 align:middle line:84%
It catalyzes and initiates
things to happen.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It sublimates and is
highly interactive.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:84%
The volatile is more of an
extroverted type of energy--

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.720 align:middle line:90%
outward moving and expansive.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a force of energy.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:90%
The spark of life.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:84%
The fix is more of
a feminine energy.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.950 align:middle line:84%
It's about bringing everything
into form or containment

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.300 align:middle line:90%
or a vessel.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:90%
It's more receptive.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Some people like
to say "passive,"

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.410 align:middle line:90%
but I wouldn't call it passive.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
It's more inward moving.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.150 align:middle line:84%
The fixed energies
are formative,

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.580 align:middle line:90%
receiving, contracting.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It's an inward
movement of energy,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.530 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to an outward force.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:90%
These two types of energy--

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:84%
volatile and fixed-- are
similar to the pillars of force

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and form on the tree of life.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, they're also
called sol and luna,

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:84%
as the sun and the moon, and
they are assigned a gender

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:90%
as masculine and feminine.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
As far as planet Earth is
concerned, the sun and the moon

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.350 align:middle line:84%
are the archetypes that
represent these two

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:25.900 align:middle line:90%
initial forces of creation--

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.145 align:middle line:90%
the volatile and the fixed.

00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:30.580 align:middle line:90%


00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:90%
But what happens next?

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, once we have
this separation

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
into volatile and fixed,
next, these two energy

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.480 align:middle line:84%
split again, duplicating the
initial act of separation.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
This generates varying
amounts of volatile

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and fixed to produce
four distinct forces.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:54.500 align:middle line:84%
There is 100 percent
volatile, which the alchemists

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.540 align:middle line:90%
labeled as "fire."

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a dominance
of volatile with some

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:84%
fixed, which they
assign as "air."

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:84%
The third is a dominance of
fixed with some volatile, which

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.170 align:middle line:90%
they then called "water."

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And finally, there's 100%
fixed, assigned as "earth."

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
This fire, air,
water, and earth are

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
what alchemists describe as the
fourth philosophical elements.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
They're not the same as
the four physical elements

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.990 align:middle line:84%
that we might
typically think of.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:10%
They're more like
forces of creation.

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:10%
In physics, these would
correspond to the strong force,

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:10%
the weak force, the
electromagnetic,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:10%
and the gravitational forces.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
And thus were the four
philosophical elements

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.070 align:middle line:84%
or forces of creation
born out of the principles

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.810 align:middle line:84%
of masculine and
feminine energies.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.330 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical model then
takes this one step further.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:10%
These four forces were then
recombined in a new way

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.050 align:middle line:10%
to generate what are called the
three essentials in alchemy.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.270 align:middle line:84%
In Western alchemy,
these three essentials

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:84%
are called "mercury,"
"sulfur," and "salt."

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.330 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, they're
called vata, pitta, kapha.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:10%
In Taoism, they are the
shen, the qi, and the jing.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.580 align:middle line:84%
In yoga, they're the
sushumna, pingala, and ida.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.220 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, these
three essentials

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
show up in multiple ways
on the tree of life.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, we should consider
these three essentials

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:84%
to be more philosophical or
archetypal essences rather than

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:84%
physical materia
that we typically

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
might associate
with mercury, sulfur

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and, salt. Now, these
three essentials

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.340 align:middle line:84%
combine in their
different proportions

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:90%
to create everything.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.250 align:middle line:84%
And so everything within
the universe, on all planes,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
contains these three essentials
in different amounts.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:84%
How do we work with
this in our lives?

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.550 align:middle line:84%
When alchemy, it's about
refining the three essentials

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:84%
of body, soul, and
spirit to bring them

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.130 align:middle line:90%
into their most elevated state.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:84%
To do so, we must first identify
what's corrupting the system

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.080 align:middle line:90%
and then address it.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Often the issues are lurking
beneath the surface, hidden

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:90%
under layers of other things.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But the beauty of alchemy is
that by taking the whole system

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle line:84%
through the
transformational process,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.220 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to root
out any impurities

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
and uplift the whole
to a higher level.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.220 align:middle line:84%
This is true even if
we don't know what

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.290 align:middle line:84%
or where the impurities
are at first.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And this applies no
matter what we're

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:90%
starting with as our materia.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be a plant or
ourselves, a relationship

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:90%
with another person or a team.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Alchemy applies at all levels.

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:90%
It's truly universal.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Take for example a relationship
between two individuals.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Say these two people
get into an argument

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're really
grating on each other.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
One person makes a comment
without realizing that they're

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.730 align:middle line:84%
stepping on a landmine,
and this comment

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
triggers a worthiness
issue for the other person.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:84%
The person who is
triggered gets emotionally

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
reactive and overreacts,
while the person who

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
made the comment gets
defensive and this situation

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:90%
starts to snowball.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Sound familiar?

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.470 align:middle line:90%
So what's going on here?

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, from an
alchemist perspective,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
the trigger points
are our impurities

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:90%
that we want to clear out.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.560 align:middle line:84%
These impurities relate to
our egos' unresolved issues

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:84%
or programming from the past
that pollute our filters

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and cause us to react
disproportionately.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They're often belief
systems or subconscious

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
emotional attachments or
wounds from the past that

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.390 align:middle line:90%
haven't been fully resolved.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And they can show up as coping
strategies or ways of defending

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.920 align:middle line:90%
ourselves when we're triggered.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Typically, these
unpleasant encounters

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:90%
are due to misperceptions.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:84%
Our subconscious and
unresolved issues

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
pollute our personal filters
and set off a chain reaction.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens
when we're triggered.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just about what
was said, but often the way

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.429 align:middle line:84%
it was said that hit
that sensitive spot.

00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Once we realize
this is happening,

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:90%
what can we do to resolve it?

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we want to
get to the bottom of it

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and create more harmony
in our relationships,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:84%
we can start by
doing two things.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
First, observe our
reactions, and second,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
identify where we're operating
from unresolved issues.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
One way to know if our
emotional response is

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
current and appropriate for
this situation versus coming

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
from our subconscious is
to use the 15 minute rule.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.360 align:middle line:90%
What's the 15 minute rule?

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a marker that helps
us identify if our emotion is

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.280 align:middle line:90%
current or not.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.280 align:middle line:84%
When our emotions are
current and appropriate

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%
to the situation, we'll
feel them, express them,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and then we're done with
them within 15 minutes.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But if something unresolved from
our past has been triggered,

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:84%
we'll think about it and emote
about it over and over for much

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:90%
longer than 15 minutes.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:10%
We might carry it around for
days or even months or years.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.015 align:middle line:84%
Can you think of a time
when you've carried

00:18:35.015 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:90%
an emotion around like this?

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Often we might dwell
on the situation,

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:84%
rehashing the scenario
over and over,

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
imagining all the ways
we should have responded.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we might even vent to
other people who will listen

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.710 align:middle line:90%
and sympathize with us.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:84%
We get fixated on
the situation, often

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.610 align:middle line:84%
making the other person wrong
and justifying our position.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.020 align:middle line:90%
But you know what--

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.530 align:middle line:84%
this attachment really
ties up our energy.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
When we keep this up for
more than 15 minutes,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
it's a sign that something from
our past has been triggered.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
feel our emotions,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge and
express them, but we

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.880 align:middle line:84%
want to resolve it and move
on, rather than continuing

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.910 align:middle line:90%
to rehash and amplify them.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:90%
How do we let go?

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:31.550 align:middle line:84%
If we can be aware and identify
when we're in that spiral,

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:84%
we can stop obsessing
about the current situation

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and ask ourselves,
what's this really about?

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:84%
When have I felt
this way before?

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:90%
How far back does it go?

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.630 align:middle line:84%
By reflecting on
this, we can root out

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.420 align:middle line:90%
what's at the bottom of it.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:84%
In the end, it
usually comes down

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.270 align:middle line:84%
to some time when we
felt unloved, violated,

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.870 align:middle line:90%
abused, or unworthy.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:84%
There's something underneath
that we haven't healed yet,

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
react negatively

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:84%
to some offhand comments
someone makes in our presence.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.120 align:middle line:84%
Now from the
alchemist perspective,

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:90%
this is a precious gift.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Here's what we need to
shift our thinking towards.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
By getting triggered around
this unresolved issue,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:84%
it's brought an
impurity to the surface.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Now that I'm aware of it, I
can do something about it.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:90%
This is where I need healing.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.600 align:middle line:84%
This situation
actually did us a favor

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:84%
because we need to
look at ourselves

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and heal wherever it
is that we disconnected

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:90%
from our wholeness.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And that trigger helps
us to trace our way back

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.210 align:middle line:90%
to its origin.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.040 align:middle line:84%
After we get this
clarity, we can then

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.320 align:middle line:84%
come back to the current
situation with a more

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:90%
appropriate response.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Such a response may go
something like this--

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:90%
"I'm sorry I reacted that way.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:59.020 align:middle line:84%
It triggered something old
and now I realize what it is.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm working on
healing this now,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to clear
things up with you."

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.090 align:middle line:84%
This level of honesty
and vulnerability

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:84%
will actually lead to
greater trust and bonding

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.620 align:middle line:90%
with that other person.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:84%
This works, so long as
we really own our stuff

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and stop blaming and
projecting it onto others.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.930 align:middle line:90%


00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.130 align:middle line:84%
The healing work is
a purifying process,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.270 align:middle line:84%
and the more we do it, the
more we raise our vibration.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.910 align:middle line:84%
We elevate ourselves
and bring ourselves

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.690 align:middle line:84%
into a more integral
and a whole state.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
We've distilled
out the essentials

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.140 align:middle line:84%
and we've let go of the
impurities or corruptabiliy.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
Once we've done that, we
can come back together.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:84%
If the other person
does their part as well,

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.470 align:middle line:84%
then the relationship can
reunite from a more purified,

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:90%
healed, and whole state.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
We're still bringing our
unique mixture of energies,

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.830 align:middle line:84%
but now we can create from
greater harmony and synergy

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.200 align:middle line:90%
instead of conflict.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.910 align:middle line:84%
The conflict arises because of
our impurities and woundedness.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The synergy in
harmony comes when

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
we're in integrity,
balanced within ourselves.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
That's when we can bring these
different gifts and skills

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.160 align:middle line:90%
to the plate in a good way.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We can offer different
ways of relating

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to create a
beautiful interaction

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and synergy that everyone
thrives from and feels uplifted

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.880 align:middle line:90%
by.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.850 align:middle line:84%
This is when we
have good chemistry.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And the result of
the interaction

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.680 align:middle line:90%
is enlivening and inspiring.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a passion or
juice that we can feel.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And that good feeling may
come with a rush of dopamine,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:84%
oxytocin, and other
endorphins, all of which

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.760 align:middle line:90%
happens because of the alchemy.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the interaction
of differences,

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:53.910 align:middle line:84%
only now they're coming together
in a more harmonized way.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And once we've done
the work to purify,

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.030 align:middle line:84%
we're better able to express
our positive qualities.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
This is where real magic
happens in relationships.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.160 align:middle line:84%
When we come together with
this synergy and passion,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:84%
we can co-create something
beyond what either one can

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.440 align:middle line:90%
create on their own.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
We use this alchemy
when creating

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
a romantic relationship,
a friendship,

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:27.870 align:middle line:84%
working as a team on a project,
or even creating a baby.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:32.310 align:middle line:84%
Is there a formula that we can
use to apply this in our lives?

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The basic process
is what alchemists

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:90%
refer to as "solve et coagula."

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a Latin phrase
that translates

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:90%
as "dissolve and coagulate."

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:84%
What it refers to is a process
of separating, then purifying,

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:90%
and then reuniting.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:55.290 align:middle line:10%
Paracelsus, the 15th century
Swiss physician and alchemist,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:10%
also coined the term "spagyria."

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:01.320 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus had a penchant
for combining ancient words

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:90%
to create new ones.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.190 align:middle line:84%
The "spagyria" comes
from a combination

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:09.570 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient Greek word
spao, meaning to "draw out"

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.390 align:middle line:90%
and ageiro, meaning "to gather."

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:10%
So Spagyria or spagyrics means
to "draw out" and "to gather."

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus used this
word to describe

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:84%
alchemy and the alchemical
process that we go through.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
The process of drawing out,
purifying and recombining

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
the three essentials
within any form

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:90%
is at the heart of alchemy.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
How do we apply this
to relationships?

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first
step is to separate.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:84%
To take some time
to be on our own.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.640 align:middle line:84%
To draw out our inner
truth and bring ourselves

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:90%
into greater clarity.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
We need to get clear about
who we are, what we are,

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and what our strengths
and weaknesses are.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:84%
What we enjoy, how we want
to spend our time, and so on.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:84%
We also need to
take time to heal

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.820 align:middle line:84%
the distortions
or the blocks that

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.540 align:middle line:84%
get in our way of our
authentic expression.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a process of refinement
to come into greater connection

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.420 align:middle line:90%
to our true self.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:84%
At some point, we may reach
as far as we can on our own,

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.290 align:middle line:84%
or we may come to a
place of being more

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:90%
in our refined essence--

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.160 align:middle line:84%
knowing ourselves, our
strengths, and our gifts

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.660 align:middle line:90%
more clearly.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.730 align:middle line:90%
And now it's time to gather--

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:84%
to come together with others
who are also doing their work to

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.940 align:middle line:90%
embody more of their true self.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Only after doing
this initial work can

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:42.450 align:middle line:84%
we catalyze that next phase
of evolution and growth.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:84%
This then brings us to
actually the midpoint

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:84%
in the alchemical
process, where we

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
come to a new level of
operating in relation to others.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But after some time,
we might realize

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:84%
that while we've made
a lot of progress,

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.240 align:middle line:84%
there's still something
that's bothering us.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.770 align:middle line:84%
It may be more subtle,
something maybe

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
just feels a little
unresolved and it

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:10.300 align:middle line:84%
nags at us in our quiet moments
and it's not going away.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Even though as a whole
things feel better,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.820 align:middle line:84%
it's important that we
pay attention and address

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.550 align:middle line:90%
these more subtle feelings.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Here's where we
have to dig deeper.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.900 align:middle line:84%
We must look within,
and usually this

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:28.310 align:middle line:84%
involves an assessment
of our core values.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Is our current situation or
relationship really lining up

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:middle line:90%
with our core values?

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:84%
We may find ourselves
in a phase where

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.885 align:middle line:84%
we begin to have to step back
again to figure ourselves out.

00:26:40.885 --> 00:26:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And this time, we do
it at a deeper level

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.620 align:middle line:90%
to really self-assess.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Is it time to figure
out our bottom line

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and get clear about what's
really bothering us?

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:56.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a deeply introspective,
soul-searching process

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.480 align:middle line:90%
that needs to happen here.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we're faced with
core-level attachments

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.540 align:middle line:90%
that we might need to sacrifice.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.210 align:middle line:84%
If this relationship is
going to continue and be all

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that it can be, we may have
to let go of some things.

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a core value
we thought was important,

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.180 align:middle line:84%
but realize it's not as
important as this relationship.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.180 align:middle line:90%
So we must be willing to change.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it is important and
we've reached our bottom line,

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and in which case,
we might decide

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:84%
we can't go any further unless
the other person adjusts.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.460 align:middle line:84%
When we do adjust,
there's usually

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.890 align:middle line:84%
some kind of
breakthrough that happens

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and we reunite
and it's glorious.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.745 align:middle line:84%
Now this relationship can
reach its full potential.

00:27:45.745 --> 00:27:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a power relationship,
an unstoppable force,

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.100 align:middle line:84%
and amazing things can
happen as a result.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.470 align:middle line:84%
If we can't make
the breakthrough,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:90%
things might fizzle out.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.000 align:middle line:84%
That relationship might
end, and we go back

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:84%
to the drawing
board with ourselves

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
to make room for
new relationships.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.610 align:middle line:84%
The goal is to find
those relationships that

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:13.660 align:middle line:84%
can become the gold and
go through the process

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
of purification as we
create this indestructible

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.990 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Those relationships
will be the ones

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.700 align:middle line:84%
where we complement each
other physically, emotionally,

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.780 align:middle line:90%
mentally, and spiritually.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.200 align:middle line:84%
To reach the highest potential
in our relationships,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:84%
we have to be living the
concept of "namaste."

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:39.700 align:middle line:84%
The divinity within me
recognizes and beholds

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.220 align:middle line:90%
the divinity within you.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.280 align:middle line:84%
We recognize the
beauty, the unity,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.280 align:middle line:90%
the godliness in each other.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.350 align:middle line:84%
We come to this
place where we want

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.120 align:middle line:84%
to treat each other
with so much love,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:84%
respect, and care because we
see them as this amazing being.

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.610 align:middle line:90%
We see them as a divine being.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:06.990 align:middle line:84%
Only when we can do this,
then can we reach the goal.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.830 align:middle line:84%
But, it will only happen when
we have the staying power

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to make it through the
tough points in the journey.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.940 align:middle line:84%
The alchemical
process is not easy.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Life is not easy.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Neither is cultivating
amazing relationships

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that can rest upon a strong
foundation of love and honor.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, we call this
"devotion to the great work."

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.900 align:middle line:84%
It's unfortunate that
in today's world,

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.890 align:middle line:84%
it seems that so
many people lack

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:39.830 align:middle line:84%
such devotion to really
see things through,

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.240 align:middle line:90%
even when they get tough.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Various experts
and media tell us

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:84%
it's because of our short
attention spans and internet

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.160 align:middle line:84%
culture of seeking
instant gratification.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:84%
But these are just symptoms
of something happening

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:90%
at a much deeper level.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.740 align:middle line:84%
In essence, we've
forgotten or disconnected

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.500 align:middle line:90%
from who we truly are.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, we've
fallen into mediocrity.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:84%
We must first remember and
reclaim our own divinity.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.680 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to recognize
our beauty, worthiness,

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:90%
self-respect, and love.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We may need to forgive ourselves
in order to love ourselves

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.080 align:middle line:90%
without exception.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness is at
the heart of all healing.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.950 align:middle line:84%
All healing starts
with forgiveness.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to accept all
parts of ourselves

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.350 align:middle line:90%
and see the divinity within.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.645 align:middle line:84%
Only then can we
give that to another.

00:30:39.645 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:47.060 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we dive deeper
into the alchemical process

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and the seven stages
of transformation.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring the
mysteries of relationship

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.820 align:middle line:84%
alchemy with me in this
episode of "Mystery Teachings."

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:02.170 align:middle line:90%
