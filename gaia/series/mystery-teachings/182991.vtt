00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings".

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.110 align:middle line:10%
Our body is equipped with
some amazing instruments

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:10%
to perceive the world around us.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
Through our senses of sight,
smell, hearing, taste,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:10%
and touch, we take in
energy and information 24/7.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we have barely scratched
the surface of our ability

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
to consciously perceive the
full spectrum of reality.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way for us
to sharpen our senses

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and expand our awareness
of the world around us?

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Through the science
of entrainment

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and the proper use of
the correct inputs,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
we can fine tune
our nervous system

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700 align:middle line:84%
and expand our ability
to perceive a greater

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:90%
spectrum of our reality.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.518 align:middle line:90%


00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:04.060 align:middle line:84%
In season one of
"Mystery Teachings",

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:84%
we explored how the
nature of our universe

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
is composed of vibrational
energies and frequencies.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:84%
We have many systems
and density levels

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
vibrating at various
frequency ranges

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.390 align:middle line:84%
all interacting to form
the reality we perceive.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
vibrating systems interact?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.950 align:middle line:84%
When one vibrational
system comes into proximity

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.350 align:middle line:84%
with another one
that has the capacity

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
to vibrate at the same
frequency range, over time

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
the two systems will
begin to vibrate

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:90%
in sync with each other.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.295 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon is
known as entrainment.

00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
This principle of
entrainment was first

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
discovered by Dutch physicist
Christiaan Huygens in 1665.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
He conducted an experiment
with pendulum clocks.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
he had set the pendulums

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.490 align:middle line:84%
all swinging at different
rates and times.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Then when he returned to
his workshop in the morning,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.445 align:middle line:84%
he'd find that they were all
swinging together in sync.

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:84%
He ultimately
realized the source

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:90%
of this entrainment phenomenon.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:84%
As the pendulum swings,
it pushes the air.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And those air molecules
create ripples,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
like pressure waves
of air propagating

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.330 align:middle line:90%
throughout the room.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.600 align:middle line:84%
These air molecules then push
against the other pendulums

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.600 align:middle line:84%
in the room, creating
a modulating force.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And the result is an
alignment of the pendulums

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
until they're all
swinging at the same rate

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.690 align:middle line:84%
and become in sync
with each other.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
It creates a resonant
coherent system.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:10%
This is a broad
reaching discovery

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:10%
that has informed many
applications of science

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:10%
from bio-musicology to brainwave
entrainment, chronobiology,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:10%
hydrodynamics, and
physics to name a few.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:84%
Whenever we have any
vibrating system that

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
comes into proximity
with another system, that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
has a potential to vibrate
at the same frequency range,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
over time those two vibrations
will begin to entrain together.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We see this in
chronobiology, for example,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
where our internal
system begins to align

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.220 align:middle line:90%
with an external rhythm.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Like circadian
rhythms correlating

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.860 align:middle line:84%
to the lunar and solar
cycles of night and day.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
the synchronization

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:84%
of women's menstrual cycles
often governed by the moon.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.300 align:middle line:84%
We also see it in the
hibernation and migration

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:90%
cycles of animals and much more.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.330 align:middle line:84%
In bio-musicology, they
apply the same principle

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:90%
for sound healing.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.350 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge has
been used for thousands

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:84%
of years within
shamanic societies

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:84%
in the form of drumming and
didgeridoo, Tibetan singing

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.290 align:middle line:84%
bowls, gongs, flutes, string
instruments, and so forth.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.380 align:middle line:84%
The modern applications
of brainwave entrainment

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.220 align:middle line:84%
use specific frequencies
input into the ears

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
with a different frequency
coming into each ear.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.630 align:middle line:84%
This then forces the brain to
combine the sounds inside of it

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
over the corpus callosum that
connects the two hemispheres.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
This combined signal
within the brain

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:84%
forms a beat or a
rhythm that equals

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:84%
the difference between the
two separate frequencies

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:90%
being input.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.530 align:middle line:84%
These binaural beats
can then be tuned

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.300 align:middle line:84%
to the desired
brainwave frequency

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.140 align:middle line:84%
level, which then entrains
the brain into that state.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways this
principle shows up anytime

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:90%
we're working with vibration.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Anything that vibrates
can be entrained.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
The key is that the
strongest resonator will win.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the case
of the pendulum clocks,

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.270 align:middle line:84%
while the clocks were originally
set to different swings,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
some pendulums would be bigger
and heavier than others.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And the bigger ones
would generate more force

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.630 align:middle line:84%
upon the air as they
swing, eventually

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
becoming the strongest
resonator and driving force

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
of the rest of the system,
causing it to all cohere

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.840 align:middle line:90%
to its state.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:84%
And how can we harness this
phenomenon of entrainment

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves?

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about our own
vibrational entrainments,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.160 align:middle line:84%
we must first realize that there
are many frequencies we have

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.200 align:middle line:90%
the potential to vibrate at.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We have a broad spectrum
of possible vibrations,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
but there are three factors
to be most aware of.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The first is amplitude, meaning
the strength or magnitude

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
of the field that we emanate
or are exposing ourselves to.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:84%
The second is
coherence, which is

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
how laser focused we can
bring our particular state

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.690 align:middle line:90%
of vibration and resonance into.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.350 align:middle line:84%
If we want to focus on
emanating the vibration of love,

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:84%
the question is how
much can we really

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
come to that full state of being
and embody it, where everything

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
is focused solely and completely
on love with nothing else

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.780 align:middle line:84%
in our awareness
or consciousness.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.510 align:middle line:84%
The third thing to be
aware of is duration,

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.370 align:middle line:84%
meaning how long can we
hold that state of coherence

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.910 align:middle line:84%
to make a sustained impact,
rather than just attaining it

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.680 align:middle line:90%
for short bursts?

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Methods like meditation, qigong
and other very ceremonial

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:84%
practices help us train
ourselves to reach coherence

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:84%
to hold our focus and
sustain it for longer periods

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
without getting
distractions in the way.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
This is something we
only master over time

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:90%
through daily practice.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.520 align:middle line:84%
The more we commit to and
develop such a practice,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
the more it strengthens our
ability to impact and direct

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:90%
the energies.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Not just feeling it inside,
but intentionally directing it

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:90%
outwardly.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
How can we bring
this into our lives?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:84%
When we train ourselves
to achieve coherence,

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:84%
to sustain it, and develop
strength in our energy field,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.740 align:middle line:84%
as well as intentional control
of the energy we emit, that is

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:84%
when we can really accomplish
Gandhi's notion of be

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.150 align:middle line:90%
the change.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And that is when we can
also make a stronger impact

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:90%
to truly change the world.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:84%
As a powerful resonator, we
can entrain our environment

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and others around us
into a higher vibration.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:84%
We can be more masterful at the
influence we have upon others

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.220 align:middle line:90%
who come into contact with us.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:10%
As we master ourselves
and our ability

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:10%
to come into that coherence
with like the vibration of love

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:10%
or inner peace, we become
a positive influence

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:10%
wherever we go and with all
the people we encounter.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.300 align:middle line:84%
We can also create an
impact within the collective

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.790 align:middle line:90%
through the connected field.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, most people

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.560 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough control over
their thoughts, their emotions,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:90%
or their energy field.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It's similar to a
radio that is bouncing

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.940 align:middle line:90%
from station to station.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, there
is static in the background.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.470 align:middle line:10%
In this digital age we
are bombarded by stimulus

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:10%
and trained to constantly
be shifting our focus.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.530 align:middle line:10%
With social media,
sensationalized news,

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.460 align:middle line:10%
thrill a minute video
games, and movies,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.690 align:middle line:10%
we are reacting to everything
based on emotion these days.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
We share articles
based on headlines

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
without even taking the time
to fully read the content

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
or research and verify the
validity of what we're sharing.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And because of this,
people have ushered

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.630 align:middle line:84%
in the post-truth society
of fake news and the like.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
With this kind of static
and lack of coherence

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.360 align:middle line:84%
within our minds
and energy field,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:84%
we will not be able to create a
coherent impact for ourselves,

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.370 align:middle line:90%
let alone the world around us.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:84%
We must first learn to
harness and maintain

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
that coherent state
of peaceful emotion

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:90%
and cultivate a quiet mind.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:10%
In Kabbalah, we call this
living the middle pillar, which

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:10%
is like the eye of the storm.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:84%
There is all this
activity around us,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.270 align:middle line:84%
and it can seem chaotic, but
we're not caught up in it.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
We're not caught
in the whirlwind.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
We maintain balance and
centeredness and calmness.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:10%
This is coherence.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.460 align:middle line:10%
And the only way to get
there is to train ourselves.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:84%
It's not just going to
happen magically on its own.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.190 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that is done to us.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
We must strengthen our
will and train our mind

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
to become our ally,
not our enemy.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do this?

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
How did we come to
this level of mastery.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Beyond spiritual practices, like
meditation, qigong ceremony,

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and ritual, there are ways
we can entrain our senses.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
In learning to entrain our
senses into a coherent state,

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.770 align:middle line:84%
we bring our nervous system
into a coherent state,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
which also entrains the
brain into a coherent state.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:84%
In this way, we can approach
this from a spiritual practice

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and also from a
physical practice.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:10%
Any long distance
runner knows that if we

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:10%
want to go the
full distance, then

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:10%
we need to find a good
rhythm, a cadence,

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:10%
to find the rhythm of
our body and breath.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
As we maintain that
rhythm, we then

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
reach a runner's high, so to
speak, and get into the groove

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:90%
where we can go forever.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
This is an example
of entrainment

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:84%
into a coherent state
through physical activity.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.020 align:middle line:84%
With our five senses,
there are two things

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
we want to pay attention to.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
First is coherence,
bringing ourselves

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%
to focus on a single frequency.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Second is the range
of perception,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.800 align:middle line:84%
having a wider
range of frequencies

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
that we can tune
into and be aware of.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.370 align:middle line:84%
We have this huge potential
within our brain capacity

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.265 align:middle line:90%
and sensory perception.

00:10:31.265 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And we are currently
only perceiving

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.950 align:middle line:84%
a small range of frequencies
within any of these systems.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Visually, we perceive
only the visible light

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
within the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Our auditory range is
about 10 octaves wide,

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:84%
while our visual
is only one octave.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
With our senses of
smell and taste,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.680 align:middle line:84%
we are accustomed and trained
to perceive certain ranges.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.350 align:middle line:10%
Our senses detect
a broader spectrum,

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.870 align:middle line:10%
but our brain is only
consciously perceiving

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:10%
a small percentage.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to become
more conscious of what it

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.705 align:middle line:90%
is that we are perceiving.

00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And one way to do this is by
training ourselves to have

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.210 align:middle line:90%
focus and pay attention.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Bring our attention to the
details, not assuming anything.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Assumption is the
enemy of perception.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to expanding
the range of perception,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
this is based on
training our senses

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.460 align:middle line:84%
to become more aware
of the subtleties

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.670 align:middle line:84%
that we aren't ordinarily
paying attention to.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
We can stretch our
range of perception

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
like stretching our visual
range into the infrared

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and the ultraviolet, maybe
even the X-ray range.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:48.060 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to stretch
our sensory range,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.420 align:middle line:84%
but it takes training
because we need to rewire

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:90%
the brain and nervous system.

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
There is an evolutionary
reason for why we perceive

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:90%
a certain range of frequencies.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But, for example, cats are much
better at seeing in the dark

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And we may notice dogs or cats
looking at something in the air

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:90%
when we don't perceive anything.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Evolution has evolved
us with different ranges

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.060 align:middle line:84%
of frequencies, but
that doesn't mean

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:84%
we can't evolve further and
stretch into these greater

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.090 align:middle line:90%
sensory perceptions.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Only when we start to
do both of these things

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.520 align:middle line:84%
to broaden the
range of perception

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.190 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention
becoming conscious

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:84%
of the stimulus
coming in do we start

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of more of
the true reality around us.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
If we were to exercise
our senses for just 11

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:84%
minutes a day, in
a matter of months

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
we could double our
conscious awareness

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.990 align:middle line:90%
of our brain capacity.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.860 align:middle line:84%
But in order to ever
get to that level,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:84%
we need to earn it by
sustainably building our way up

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
to that level of perception
awareness by our own efforts,

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
unlike what is
depicted in the movies

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.300 align:middle line:90%
or claimed in popular fads.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are finely tuned
instruments of perception,

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.340 align:middle line:84%
perceiving all the frequencies
coming into the system.

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.060 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways we perceive is
through our physical senses,

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:84%
but our bodies are
also perceiving

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.820 align:middle line:84%
more subtle energies, energies
like the four elements--

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.210 align:middle line:84%
magnetic energy, etheric
energy, auric energy,

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:90%
and dimensional energies.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.740 align:middle line:84%
These subtle energies
and vibrations

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
are what the Western mystery
school tradition describes

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:90%
as the five spiritual senses.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And we experience these through
our intuitive perceptions,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
a clairaudience, clairvoyance,
and clairsentience.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:84%
We often describe
this perception

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
of a subtle energy fields as
intuition or the sixth sense.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But we can see these
energies are actually

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.880 align:middle line:90%
all part of our physicality.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Like the pendulums
of Huygens' clocks,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.730 align:middle line:84%
our bodies perceive the
resonating frequencies

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:90%
within our biofield.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:10%
We may not always be aware of
these vibrational frequencies,

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:10%
but we all have the
ability to expand

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.360 align:middle line:10%
our spiritual and physical
senses to begin to perceive

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.430 align:middle line:10%
them more consciously.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It's simply a
matter of practice.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:84%
What are some simple exercises
for expanding our awareness

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:90%
of the physical senses?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Let's explore this.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Within just a few months of
practicing these exercises,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.370 align:middle line:84%
we can double our
conscious awareness

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:90%
of what we're perceiving.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.450 align:middle line:84%
We can shift from
maybe 10% consciousness

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:90%
to 20% conscious awareness.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.140 align:middle line:84%
To open our visual
perception, it's really

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.360 align:middle line:90%
about looking at the details.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't assume.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.490 align:middle line:84%
We tend to glance over things
and just get pieces of it,

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
and then the brain
fills in the details

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:84%
through assumptions
and expectations.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.030 align:middle line:84%
To exercise this area of
perception, really look.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to
all the details.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:10%
For example, see how far you
can perceive, like billboards,

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:10%
for example, while driving.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
See how far you can
make out the details.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.660 align:middle line:84%
Another exercise is to pick
an object across the room

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:84%
and really look
closely at the details.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Then close the eyes and try
to recreate it in your mind.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
See how many
details you can get.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Then after a little
while, open the eyes

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.110 align:middle line:90%
and see what you missed.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Then take a piece of paper and
roll it up and look through it

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.110 align:middle line:90%
like a telescope.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Gradually, move yourself
closer and closer to the object

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
until you're right
up next to it,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:84%
looking at all the details
and textures through the paper

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.600 align:middle line:90%
telescope.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Then open your eyes and
look at it in a regular way

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:90%
again up close.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.560 align:middle line:90%
Take in any other details.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, with that new
awareness of those details,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
start backing up slowly,
holding your focus on the item

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and return to a place where you
can sit and close your eyes,

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.960 align:middle line:84%
and recreate the image in your
mind with all of the details.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Compare this to
your first attempt

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
at recreating the
image in your mind.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.450 align:middle line:84%
With this process, we're
focusing on detail,

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:84%
not assuming anything
and retraining ourselves

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:90%
to that awareness of detail.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.250 align:middle line:84%
By recreating the
image inside the mind,

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
this is also a way to start not
only training our visual sense,

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:84%
but our clairvoyance
or inner vision.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.740 align:middle line:84%
We can do the same thing with
auditory processing to open up

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.750 align:middle line:90%
our sense of hearing.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.500 align:middle line:84%
For the auditory exercise,
it's best to close the eyes

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention to the sounds
in the room you're sitting in.

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.960 align:middle line:84%
We start to, one by one, bring
our attention to every sound

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:84%
that we can hear and
identify what it is.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Then we begin to expand
our perception of sound

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.660 align:middle line:84%
and reach out and pay attention
to the sounds outside the room.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And then expand even
further to listening

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:12.150 align:middle line:84%
to the sounds out on the street
or in the neighbor's apartment.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And we can then
start to bridge this

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
to our clairaudience or
inner hearing, where we also

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.339 align:middle line:84%
start to engage
consciousness and maybe

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:90%
active imagination a bit more.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
So we imagine shifting
our focus of perception

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:84%
as if we're hovering in
the air above our building.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And we take in all the
sounds within that vicinity.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Then we go higher and
higher until we're

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.160 align:middle line:84%
hearing all the sounds
of the neighborhood.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And see how far we can take
this, how far we can expand.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Next, we start to
journey back in,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
returning our attention
back to the neighborhood,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:90%
then back into the room.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And now, eliminating
the sounds one by one,

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:90%
bringing our focus in.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Eliminate the sounds
in the room until we

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.013 align:middle line:84%
are focused on only the
sound of our own heartbeat.

00:18:04.013 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:84%
When we can get
to the place where

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.540 align:middle line:84%
we are focused on the sound of
our own heartbeat and nothing

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
else, this will bring
us into coherence.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.790 align:middle line:90%
How about our sense of smell?

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, to expand
our sense of smell,

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
we can work with a broad
range of essential oils,

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.740 align:middle line:90%
identifying each one.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
Start with the pure notes first,
such as mint versus cinnamon.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And later, move on towards
identifying the elements

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.090 align:middle line:90%
within a blend.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We can do the same for taste,
working with different flavors.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Gather varieties of
fruits and spices.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And this is similar to
what food critics do

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.280 align:middle line:84%
to train their
palate to recognize

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:84%
all the different hints
and flavors within a dish.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.790 align:middle line:84%
We can also work with a
partner using a blindfold.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And one partner feeds the
other, which is pretty fun.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And through this, we
learn how to identify

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:84%
the hints and the flavors
without relying upon our eyes.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:84%
How about with our
sense of touch?

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, with touch, we can work
with different textures,

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:84%
different objects, and try
to feel them and describe

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:90%
them using our hands.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
But to really test ourselves,
let's do this, for example.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Get three objects that are
the same size, weight, shape,

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.370 align:middle line:90%
and smoothness.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, we could work with
a crystal ball, a glass ball,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and a ball of metal or
petrified wood, or maybe three

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.360 align:middle line:84%
different types of
polished crystals.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Then when blindfolded,
we won't be

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:84%
able to tell the difference
based on texture or weight,

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
but we can hold it
and feel the energy.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Each object is going to
have a different quality,

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.220 align:middle line:90%
different vibration.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And we feel that through
the sense of touch

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:49.440 align:middle line:90%
to help awaken clairsentience.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And as we do,
describe the qualities

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.670 align:middle line:84%
that you get with each
of those feelings.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
These are all methods
to expand our ability

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.940 align:middle line:84%
to perceive the frequencies
that come in through our senses

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
and biofield through
dedicated practice.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.470 align:middle line:84%
To start, choose maybe one
sensory exercise to focus on.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Exercise it for 11 minutes a day
for 28 days or one moon cycle,

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and then move on to the next.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Or we can also work
with all the senses,

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
each of them being 11
minutes per day per exercise.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And plan to spend then, if
you're going to do that,

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.000 align:middle line:84%
about an hour to make
progress with multiple senses

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.550 align:middle line:84%
at once within that
allotted time each day.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Once we've gotten good at
identifying specific notes

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.650 align:middle line:84%
on a spectrum, for
example, identifying

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
specific essential oils out of
a variety, or specific tastes,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
like a connoisseur, then we
can take it to the next level.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Once we've trained our
senses to recognize

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
these specific frequencies
related to different inputs,

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.570 align:middle line:84%
the next step is
to attune ourselves

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:90%
without the physical input.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.290 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, for example, remember,
what does frankincense

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:90%
feel like and smell like?

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:12.420 align:middle line:84%
How did it feel when you were
interacting with it physically?

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Recall it.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Remember it.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And by invoking that memory and
that feeling within ourselves,

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.680 align:middle line:84%
we can, by will alone,
entrain ourselves back

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:90%
to that frequency.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.780 align:middle line:90%
This is used in music a lot.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.580 align:middle line:84%
There is a saying that says what
goes in with music comes out

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:90%
with music.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:10%
And one way we can apply
this is by putting music

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.400 align:middle line:10%
on in the background
when we study.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
When we need to take a test,
if we just then remember

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:84%
the few notes of
that music that we

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
were using while studying
that particular subject,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
then the information we
took in with that music

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.340 align:middle line:84%
will start to flow into
our consciousness again.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Another example of this
is how we've all likely

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:84%
experienced smelling a whiff of
a particular cologne or perfume

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:90%
worn by someone we loved.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
It instantly brings back
memories and feelings

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.000 align:middle line:90%
of that person.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.760 align:middle line:84%
We can consciously
and intentionally

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
use these memories
of sensory input

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:84%
to train ourselves into certain
states of being and attuning

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:90%
our frequencies to that level.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But it only works if we've
been regular with our training,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:84%
or if there is a strong
emotional connection

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:90%
to that memory.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Memory is based on repetition
and strong emotional

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.820 align:middle line:84%
connections to a
particular event.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
By recalling or imagining
the feeling in our body,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.950 align:middle line:84%
we can re-entrain ourselves, our
brain and our nervous system,

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
back to that state of
being kind of like a dream.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
The brain doesn't actually know
the difference between a dream

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:90%
and our outer reality.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:90%
It fires in the same way.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And it feels just as real.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.230 align:middle line:10%
Through active imagination,
with properly trained

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:10%
senses and nervous system,
and being conscious

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:10%
of how we felt in
certain states of being,

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:10%
we can bring ourselves back
into any desired state of being.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:10%
We can use our will
to shift ourselves

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.420 align:middle line:10%
on that spectrum of
frequencies until we

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:19.030 align:middle line:10%
bring ourselves fully into a
coherent state of our desire.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a closer look
at the spiritual senses.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
How do these intuitive
or spiritual senses

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
fit in with our
scientific understanding

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:90%
of the human energy field?

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.970 align:middle line:84%
In modern day terminology,
we call it the biofield.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And the biofield consists of the
aura, electromagnetic energy,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:84%
and bio-photons, which
is basically light.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
We also have ionic
and magnetic energies,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
which come from the charge of
the atoms within our bodies.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Anytime there is
an electric charge,

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and that charge
starts to move, it

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.870 align:middle line:90%
will create a magnetic field.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.080 align:middle line:84%
An example of ionic
electromagnetic energy

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.620 align:middle line:84%
is when we slap our hands
together really hard.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And then we rub them together,
build up heat and friction,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and then slow down, and start to
gently glide the hands past one

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.790 align:middle line:90%
another, not touching.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Slowly moving them
back and forth

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and feel that
magnetic pull and push

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.710 align:middle line:90%
as they glide past each other.

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
We can also expand
it and contract it.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.665 align:middle line:84%
And feel where you hit
that push and that pull.

00:24:40.665 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:90%


00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:90%
This is magnetic energy.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done is
we've ionized our hands,

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
rushing all the
blood into our hands

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.240 align:middle line:84%
by clapping, and then rubbing
really fast and furious ionizes

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.380 align:middle line:90%
the atoms on the skin.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.450 align:middle line:84%
This creates an electromagnetic
charge between our hands.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
We feel the energy
field we created.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:84%
This is the basis of what
we call polarity therapy.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is an experience
of the physics.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.860 align:middle line:90%
It is energy.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.360 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it's real.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:90%
We're not just imagining things.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:90%
This is real biophysical energy.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Our energy body or biofield is
just as complex and intricate

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.880 align:middle line:84%
as the inside of
our physical body.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:32.120 align:middle line:84%
In metaphysics, we first say
that the physical density

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.420 align:middle line:84%
itself is made of
the four elements.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:84%
In our modern
terminology, we could

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:84%
compare these four elements
of earth, water, air, fire

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to the elements of life,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and carbon.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are made of these
four elements primarily.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Or we could go deeper
into the atomic level

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to protons,
neutrons, electrons,

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:90%
and photons.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.850 align:middle line:84%
However we want to arrange
it and at whatever scale,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.800 align:middle line:84%
we can relate the
physical density

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.990 align:middle line:90%
with these four components.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Within our energy field, we also
have these physical energies

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
of what we call the
four elements as well.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:16.220 align:middle line:84%
They extend off her body
about three feet out,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.980 align:middle line:84%
about as far as our arms
will reach out from the body.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to the
flow of the four elements

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.610 align:middle line:84%
out to three feet, we
also have magnetic energy.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic energy as any
time light or photons

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:84%
hit the four elements
of the physical density.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.660 align:middle line:84%
This creates an
electromagnetic field

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.970 align:middle line:90%
around that physical density.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The light is interacting
with the electrons

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:84%
of the physical body, moving
them causing a magnetic field.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:84%
One way we can look at
electromagnetic energy

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
is through EEG and
MEG devices today.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Measuring the electromagnetic
energies, for example,

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.200 align:middle line:90%
of the brain and the heart.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.760 align:middle line:84%
The heart is the strongest
generator of the magnetic field

00:26:58.760 --> 00:26:59.980 align:middle line:90%
within our body.

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:84%
It's constantly pumping
blood and ions through it.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:90%
It's in constant motion.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.050 align:middle line:84%
While the brain is working more
with electrical connections

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:11.060 align:middle line:90%
between the neurons.

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.520 align:middle line:84%
The heart creates
an energetic field,

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
which can be detected up
to at least three feet

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:84%
in any direction, and some
sources say even further.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
These are things we can become
aware of and start to perceive.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So how do we start attuning
ourselves to better perceive

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.750 align:middle line:84%
these energies within
the biofield and our aura

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to activate and
strengthen these energies?

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about five
spiritual senses here.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.240 align:middle line:84%
So let me repeat what those five
are again, just to be clear.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.230 align:middle line:84%
We have the four elements,
the magnetic energies,

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.190 align:middle line:84%
the etheric energies, the
aura, and the dimensions.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
the four elements.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.780 align:middle line:10%
To activate and
become more in tune

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:10%
with these four
elements within us,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:10%
we can begin by
turning ourselves

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:10%
in to an experience
of these four elements

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.970 align:middle line:10%
by imagining ourselves,
for example, on the beach.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We can feel and bathe
in those elements

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.220 align:middle line:84%
through meditations
and visualizations

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.780 align:middle line:84%
to create an inner experience
of the four elements.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.910 align:middle line:84%
The other key when working
with the four elements

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
is to ensure that they are
in balance with each other,

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:23.030 align:middle line:84%
both within ourselves
and our environment,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
rather than having one in
excess over the others.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.605 align:middle line:90%
How about magnetic energies?

00:28:29.605 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, to exercise our
awareness of magnetic energies,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.960 align:middle line:84%
we look for anything
that has activity

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:37.240 align:middle line:90%
that involves polarity.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then we work to
harmonize the polarity.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So an example like that
of clapping our hands

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and rubbing them really fast
to feel the energy, that

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.880 align:middle line:90%
is one way to work with it.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Also, though, activities that
engage the right and left

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:57.260 align:middle line:84%
hemispheres of our brain working
together in a harmonic way.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:10%
So for example, things like
playing chess and strategy

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:04.840 align:middle line:10%
games or listening to
classical music, also movements

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.120 align:middle line:10%
like qigong and Tai Chi.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.420 align:middle line:84%
All of these are activities
that activate magnetic energy

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.260 align:middle line:84%
within the brain,
harmonizing the hemispheres.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic energy
is about movement.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So any kind of exercises, like
walking or bilateral movement

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.400 align:middle line:84%
or running, these
movements in the body

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.110 align:middle line:90%
generate magnetic energy.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:28.510 align:middle line:90%
What about etheric energies?

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.000 align:middle line:90%
How can we activate these?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Etheric energy relates to our
will and how we flow our will.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
about our will.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the will of
the human collective

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and the will of nature
and the universe,

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.630 align:middle line:84%
as well as the will
of spirit or source.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:51.500 align:middle line:84%
One question to consider is
how do we strengthen our will.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.730 align:middle line:84%
This is done by having
a good practice.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And every time that
we exercise our choice

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.430 align:middle line:84%
to do our meditations,
our spiritual practice,

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:05.040 align:middle line:84%
our rituals, this is
an exercise of will.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.620 align:middle line:84%
There is always a
lower will of the ego

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.380 align:middle line:84%
battling it out with the
higher will of our higher

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.970 align:middle line:90%
self or spirit.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:84%
And every time we do the
good work and the practices

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.960 align:middle line:84%
of aligning with our higher
self, our spiritual practice,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
we are strengthening
our higher will.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.710 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, every
time we're feeding the ego,

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.440 align:middle line:84%
falling into its
resistance and its excuses,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.980 align:middle line:84%
we're strengthening the
ego's hold on our will.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.340 align:middle line:84%
If our intention is to
reach our full potential

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and master ourselves,
that is our higher will

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that we want to feed through
a daily spiritual practice.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:48.370 align:middle line:84%
It will help awaken our gifts
and our innate capacities.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.330 align:middle line:84%
The will of the divine is
to progress and to realize

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.580 align:middle line:90%
our full potential.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is also
key to activating

00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:90%
our etheric energies.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Our etheric energy is
related to that zero point

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:90%
field of quantum physics.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.560 align:middle line:84%
We tap into the zero point
field through stillness,

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.760 align:middle line:84%
through the quiet pond,
accessing the gap,

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and coming into
a coherent state.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Through this
practice, we can tap

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:84%
into the higher vibrations
of etheric energies

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:90%
coming in from divine source.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.080 align:middle line:84%
We allow that to fill us and
recalibrate us, realign us

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.200 align:middle line:90%
to that divine flow and will.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.364 align:middle line:90%


00:31:32.364 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do we harness our aura?

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.670 align:middle line:84%
The aura is the field
of energy flowing down

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.970 align:middle line:84%
through the seven chakras
and then out into seven

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:90%
layers around us.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Using practices like
Tai Chi or qigong,

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.700 align:middle line:84%
we can flow the energy
through those movements.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And as we do,
imagine and be aware

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.920 align:middle line:84%
of it flowing through
the whole aura, not just

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.850 align:middle line:84%
our immediate space, but
all the way out to 50 feet.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual rituals also call in
energy from spiritual realms.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And they call this into the
physical world through us.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:84%
We have many of these practices
within the universal Kabbalah

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.600 align:middle line:90%
and mystery school tradition.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And as we become
aware of our aura,

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.400 align:middle line:84%
we can discern these energies
flowing through our aura

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.840 align:middle line:90%
and our entire energy field.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And we can bring our field
into greater coherence

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.140 align:middle line:90%
with these spiritual energies.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the final of the
five spiritual senses

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:84%
is what we call
dimensional energies.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.210 align:middle line:84%
We can activate the
dimensions, first,

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:41.630 align:middle line:84%
by realizing that we are
multidimensional beings.

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.930 align:middle line:84%
This is a topic we explored
extensively in season one.

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And through expanded
states of consciousness,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.840 align:middle line:84%
we stretch our awareness
to realize more

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.970 align:middle line:90%
of our multi-dimensionality.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.890 align:middle line:10%
Expanding our consciousness
through meditation,

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.360 align:middle line:10%
through working with the tree of
life, through sacred geometry,

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:10%
building up to higher and
higher dimensional models,

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.330 align:middle line:10%
and visualizing those
things around us.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
As well, we can use the
technique of astral travel.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And we can consciously
direct our awareness out

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.330 align:middle line:84%
of the body to higher
dimensions or frequency levels.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.450 align:middle line:84%
These are all ways
to train our ability

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.030 align:middle line:90%
to perceive dimensional energy.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And just as with the
exercises for expanding

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.420 align:middle line:84%
our physical senses, we can
work with these activities

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.920 align:middle line:84%
to enhance our spiritual senses
by doing them 11 minutes a day

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.030 align:middle line:84%
each and begin to
perceive more as we do.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Consistency of a regular
practice is the key.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And through these exercises
to activate and expand

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.360 align:middle line:84%
both the physical
and spiritual senses,

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.290 align:middle line:84%
we are entraining the nervous
system and the physical senses

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
to tune into the
biofield and perceive

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:54.490 align:middle line:84%
with our spiritual senses, as
well as our physical senses.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:90%
We become more aware.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.820 align:middle line:84%
We use our brain capacity
to more consciously perceive

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.740 align:middle line:84%
what's really going on around
us, physically and spiritually.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.540 align:middle line:84%
This helps to awaken our innate
gifts, the gifts of the spirit,

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.270 align:middle line:84%
gifts of the soul, and
the gifts of the body.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:17.980 align:middle line:84%
As we awaken these gifts, we
begin to harness and access

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.139 align:middle line:84%
more of our
potential and ability

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to direct those
gifts with our will.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we discover more

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:30.010 align:middle line:84%
of how we process and perceive
energy and information

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
so that we can gain greater
self mastery in our lives.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Teresa Bullard.
