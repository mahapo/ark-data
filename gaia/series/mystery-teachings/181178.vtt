00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.060 align:middle line:90%
How did the universe come to be?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:90%
What started it all?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:10%
Was there anything
before the universe?

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we explore
these age-old questions,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.650 align:middle line:10%
comparing both the scientific
and metaphysical cosmology.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.850 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 align:middle line:84%
We are all familiar
with the dramatic words

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
of Genesis describing the
creation of heaven and Earth.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.840 align:middle line:84%
But long before the
Bible was ever written,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
creation stories
have been a part

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
of every spiritual and shamanic
tradition throughout the world.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We yearn to understand this vast
universe and our place in it.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Most creation stories fall
under one of two types,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:84%
either the universe was
created from nothing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.570 align:middle line:84%
or it is eternal with
no beginning or end.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:84%
But as we'll see through the
union of modern astrophysics

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
and ancient mystery school
teachings of cosmology,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:84%
we can reconcile these
two contrasting views

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and gain new insight into
the nature of the multiverse.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
While many religions
placed Earth

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.230 align:middle line:84%
at the center of creation,
this was not always

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:90%
the dominant view.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, ancient hermetic
and alchemical teachings

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:84%
said that the sun was the
center, while Mayan shamans had

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:84%
a very precise and
complex astronomical

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
calendar that was based
on galactic cycles

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:90%
around the Milky Way.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Scientific revolutions
in cosmology

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:90%
began during the Renaissance.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:10%
Nicolaus Copernicus
used mathematics

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.400 align:middle line:10%
to show the sun
should be the center.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:10%
Johannes Kepler
improved upon this

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:10%
by proposing a sacred geometry
model of the solar system,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.610 align:middle line:10%
while Galileo conducted
many observations supporting

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:10%
these ideas.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:10%
But it wasn't until
Isaac Newton formulated

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.289 align:middle line:10%
his laws of motion
and gravitation

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:10%
that the scientific revolution
was finally cemented in.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have all heard of
these great achievements.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
What we are not usually told
is that all of these scientists

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:90%
were initiates.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
They studied the ancient
hermetic, alchemical,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and Pythagorean mystery
school teachings.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And it is from the
metaphysical arts and sciences

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.575 align:middle line:84%
that these greats gained
their true insights.

00:02:33.575 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
How has cosmology changed
since the Renaissance era?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Progress didn't
really start happening

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
until the 20th century
when scientific cosmology

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.200 align:middle line:90%
had a rebirth.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It kicked off with
Einstein's theory

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.420 align:middle line:84%
of general relativity
that said space-time

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:90%
is curved and dynamic.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:10%
Then as telescope
technology vastly improved,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:10%
Edwin Hubble was able to prove
that the universe is expanding

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:10%
rather than static.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.440 align:middle line:84%
The universe was also shown to
be much bigger than we realized

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
with our solar
system being just one

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.750 align:middle line:90%
tiny speck in the grand cosmos.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Then came the theories of the
Big Bang, inflation, and how

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.710 align:middle line:84%
the heavier elements are made
in the inner cores of stars

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:90%
and supernovae.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Now in the 21st century, a
new revolution in cosmology

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.070 align:middle line:84%
is taking place as
we reignite our quest

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
for the stars through space
exploration and quantum

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:90%
technologies.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
We now have our sights
set upon the multiverse.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are
trying to find ways

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
to peer into parallel universes,
access higher dimensions,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.165 align:middle line:84%
and use wormholes to
travel through space-time.

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:50.770 align:middle line:84%
But before we can
understand the multiverse,

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
let's first make sure we
understand this universe

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that we live in.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:90%
How did our universe come to be?

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have heard of today's
scientific model of the Big

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Bang.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It says the universe started
with a great explosion

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:90%
about 14 billion years ago.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
How does this model compare
to ancient metaphysical

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.950 align:middle line:90%
cosmologies?

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
One of the first metaphysical
accounts of creation

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that really got my
attention, as a scientist,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.209 align:middle line:84%
was from the
tradition of Kabbalah.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:10%
The kabbalistic creation
stories remarkably

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.020 align:middle line:10%
coincide with present
day Big Bang models.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The first Kabbalah
book I ever read

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.240 align:middle line:84%
was a retranslation of
Genesis' chapter one

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
based on kabbalistic
understanding.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And at that same
time, I had also

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
been attending
astrophysics lectures

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
Washington on modern cosmology.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking, wow,
they're saying the same things,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
only Kabbalah goes
further into areas

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:90%
that science can't yet reach.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I wondered what insights we
might gain from Kabbalah.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.220 align:middle line:84%
How might Kabbalah help
guide our investigations

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and development of
new physics theories?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:84%
What was most astonishing
was that the Kabbalists

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:84%
have had these insights for well
over 1,000 years, while science

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:84%
has only just come around to
this point in the last 50 years

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.950 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:90%
How do they relate?

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.570 align:middle line:10%
To explore the correlation,
we can overlay the Big Bang

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.860 align:middle line:10%
timeline onto the
kabbalistic tree of life.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:84%
Science tells us that the Big
Bang started with a quantum

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:90%
fluctuation out of the vacuum.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
As that fluctuation emerged
out of the quantum sea,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.700 align:middle line:84%
it became a center
point, a singularity that

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.670 align:middle line:90%
was infinitely dense and tiny.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.980 align:middle line:90%
They called this the Planck era.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And at this point,
time did not exist.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:84%
The top of the tree of
life, known as the crown,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
is this first instant
of the universe's birth.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.935 align:middle line:90%
It's the spark, the singularity.

00:05:54.935 --> 00:05:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And at this point, everything
is a unified, coherent whole.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
All forces, particles,
and light are one.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
What might this initial
state have been like?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's beyond
any known physics,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.520 align:middle line:84%
but mystics and scientists
alike describe it as total unity

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
where all is
absolute perfection.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistically, we'd call
this the perfect "I am,"

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:90%
or the center point of creation.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The second point on the
tree, called wisdom,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.960 align:middle line:84%
coincides with the initial
spark beginning to expand.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:84%
From the singularity,
all the quantum

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
potentials explode out in
what we call the Big Bang.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.320 align:middle line:84%
What was actually expanding
was space-time itself.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Now it's interesting
that the name Big Bang

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.720 align:middle line:90%
was given for this expression.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, there was no literal
bang or physical sound made,

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.260 align:middle line:84%
but there was an explosion of
force that caused a shattering.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.970 align:middle line:90%
What's meant by a shattering?

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
This idea comes up
several times in

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
both scientific and
kabbalistic cosmologies.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:10.200 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, the primordial
vessel, or singularity,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
had such intense
energy from source

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
flowing into it that it could no
longer contain all the energy.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Under this intensity,
the vessel shattered.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Sparks and shards
explode out everywhere.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:90%
A primordial chaos ensues.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:84%
To stop the catastrophe
from going too far,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.910 align:middle line:84%
a new form of order
needs to come in

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.640 align:middle line:90%
to reorganize the potentials.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Source then initiates the
reformation of the tree of life

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
to its current arrangement.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
How does this apply in science?

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, scientists call the
shattering a phase change,

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.190 align:middle line:90%
or a symmetry breaking.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The simplest analogy
is to think of water.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.160 align:middle line:84%
In the liquid state, water
is uniform and smooth.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.370 align:middle line:84%
But as it cools to
freezing temperatures,

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:90%
tiny ice crystals begin to form.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
This is a phase change that
begins to break the uniformity.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:84%
When the water
completely freezes,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.180 align:middle line:84%
we can see cracks,
bubbles, and crystals.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:84%
The water symmetry
is then broken.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:84%
The molecules
rearrange themselves

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.310 align:middle line:90%
into a new formation.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.320 align:middle line:84%
As they come into
this new order,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.460 align:middle line:84%
excess energy releases
and the system stabilizes.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:90%
What shatters at this step?

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Unity itself is what shatters.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
This first cause leads to
the expansion of space-time.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
And according to Einstein's
general relativity,

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
space-time variations
are equivalent

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.970 align:middle line:90%
to gravitational forces.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.570 align:middle line:84%
The unity force is
broken by this expansion

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and gravity splits off
to become its own entity,

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:84%
while the other forces
remain unified and symmetric.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.050 align:middle line:84%
This means all light and matter
are still unified and formless.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
They call this the
Grand Unification Era,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
but it lasts only a teeny,
tiny fraction of a second.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:84%
As space-time
expands, the quantum

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:84%
potentials then flow in
to become an incredibly

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:90%
hot, dense plasma of radiation.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.050 align:middle line:90%
What happens next?

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
The third point on the tree
of life, called understanding,

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.240 align:middle line:84%
relates to the formation
of archetypal blueprints.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.850 align:middle line:84%
These are the
patterns and laws that

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
will govern all the
rest of creation.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.580 align:middle line:84%
In Kabbalah, this point
on the tree of life

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.950 align:middle line:84%
has a very feminine
characteristic,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:84%
while the previous one had
more masculine aspects.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Here we can imagine a bunch of
fertilized seeds being planted

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:90%
within the womb of space-time.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, the womb was
only the size of a single atom.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Physically, as the universe
continues to expand and cool,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
it causes a second phase
change, or symmetry breaking.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:84%
This time, the unified
force splits into two,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:84%
separating the strong and
the electroweak forces that

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.980 align:middle line:90%
govern nuclear interactions.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.040 align:middle line:84%
The strong force is
responsible for building quarks

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
together to form particles,
like protons and neutrons,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.370 align:middle line:84%
as well as to bind
those particles together

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.080 align:middle line:90%
to form nuclei.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The electroweak force
is the unification

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
of electromagnetic
and weak forces

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that govern the interactions
of charged particles

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.580 align:middle line:90%
and nuclear decay.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Scientists call this
the Electroweak Era.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The second phase change also
causes density fluctuations,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:90%
or tiny domains to form.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.600 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It means that rather
than being perfectly

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
smooth, right from
the beginning,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:90%
there are variations.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:90%
Now why is this important?

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Those tiny fluctuations
became like cosmic seeds.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:84%
Again, we can imagine the
feminine womb being impregnated

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
by the masculine seed.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And we might also think of
them as alchemical vessels

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.600 align:middle line:90%
in a cosmic laboratory.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Inside these vessels, the future
stars, solar systems, galaxies,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
and other cosmic
structures would

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.550 align:middle line:84%
be synthesized, including the
elements that we are made of.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
What's more, the
expansion and distribution

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:84%
of these fluctuations took
on a fractal behavior.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.910 align:middle line:90%
What do we mean by fractal here?

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
It means that it is
a pattern that is

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.700 align:middle line:90%
repeated at almost every scale.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And this establishes the
first archetypal forms.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
With this third point
on the tree of life,

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
we form the first sacred
geometry of the triangle

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
and establish the
roots of the three

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.980 align:middle line:84%
pillars of masculine force,
feminine form, and unity,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.460 align:middle line:90%
or balance.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The dynamic dance of energy
between these three pillars

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:84%
is the generative
system of all creation.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.090 align:middle line:90%
This is the formula.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.230 align:middle line:84%
The rest of the tree simply
duplicates this pattern.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
These first three
steps all happen

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.660 align:middle line:84%
in less than a teeny,
tiny fraction of a second

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.280 align:middle line:90%
after the Big Bang.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:84%
Even though we may describe
them as separate steps,

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:90%
they are really all one.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Now what usually happens after
the pregnant womb expands

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:90%
to a certain point?

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.300 align:middle line:90%
It's time to give birth.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.060 align:middle line:10%
In this case, the
birthing is what science

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.460 align:middle line:10%
calls the Inflationary Era.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.600 align:middle line:10%
The infant universe
suddenly and very rapidly

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.330 align:middle line:10%
inflates from about 1
nanometer in diameter,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.410 align:middle line:10%
which is half the
width of a DNA helix,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:10%
up to 100 trillion
kilometers across.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Space-time expanded faster
than the speed of light

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:90%
for a tiny fraction of a second.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:90%
What did that cause?

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, a huge amount
of energy was released.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:90%
A true vacuum was established.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And a third final
symmetry breaking occurs.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.130 align:middle line:84%
This time, it was
a big shattering.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Scientifically, the
so-called Higgs field froze

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.840 align:middle line:84%
and the electromagnetic and
weak forces also separate out.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Prior to this point,
the hot plasma

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.820 align:middle line:84%
of particles,
light, and radiation

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.390 align:middle line:84%
was still rather homogeneous
and undifferentiated.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.590 align:middle line:84%
After this third
shattering, particles

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:35.210 align:middle line:84%
gained mass, charge, spin,
and other characteristics

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:90%
that defined them uniquely.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The Higgs field is what
scientists currently

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:84%
believe is the cause
of mass in particles,

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.250 align:middle line:84%
while the electromagnetic
fields govern interactions

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:90%
between charged particles.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And the weak force is the
mediator of nuclear decay,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
like what happens in
radioactive materials.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistically, we can
equate this final shattering

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:84%
to the creation of the
abyss on the tree of life.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.440 align:middle line:84%
The abyss is this great divide
between the universe we know

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and the supernal
realm of unification.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like a rip in
the fabric of space

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:84%
that distorts
everything that happens

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:90%
below or after the abyss.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
We can also think of what
happens to white light

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
when it shines through a prism.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.020 align:middle line:84%
That light then separates
out into a spectrum

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:90%
of diverse colors.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
The universe appears
very different

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.400 align:middle line:84%
above and below this
final shattering.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Above is the realm of
supersymmetry and unity.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Below is the world we know.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.580 align:middle line:84%
After this final shattering,
the whole process

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:90%
slows down dramatically.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.160 align:middle line:84%
This next part of
the story correlates

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:84%
with the sphere of mercy, or
love, on the tree of life.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.610 align:middle line:84%
This sphere has to do
with limitless light

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and establishing the laws of
order in the physical universe.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.110 align:middle line:84%
Standard model quantum physics,
the four physical forces,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
and the laws of nature
that we are more familiar

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.340 align:middle line:90%
with kick in here.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Subatomic particles
and antiparticles

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:11.040 align:middle line:84%
begin to form and then
annihilate within the plasma,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.060 align:middle line:84%
producing high-energy photons
that dominate this era.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:84%
This could be considered a
"let there be light" moment.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
By one second
after the Big Bang,

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:84%
only a small
percentage of particles

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:30.150 align:middle line:84%
survive to become the eventual
building blocks of matter.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.850 align:middle line:84%
The fact that any
particle survived at all

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
is because there must
have been more particles

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.290 align:middle line:90%
than antiparticles.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:84%
But why that would be
so is a big mystery

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
scientists still
don't understand.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a very fortunate
mystery, for us

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:84%
at least, because if it
hadn't been this way,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
then nothing would have
survived in the early universe

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.850 align:middle line:90%
except photons of light.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistically,
though, we might

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:59.040 align:middle line:84%
wonder if some of
those antiparticles

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.090 align:middle line:84%
could have fallen into the
abyss in the previous step,

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
while the regular particles were
transmitted across the abyss

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
to be formed into the
universe we see today.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case,
then there must

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
have been some plan guiding
the creative process.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Next comes the sphere
of severity, or power.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
This one is about placing
limits upon the limitless light.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It begins to form and restrict
things according to the laws.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.580 align:middle line:84%
This begins with what
scientists call nucleosynthesis

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.770 align:middle line:90%
and what I call cosmic alchemy.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.890 align:middle line:10%
The strong force binds
protons and neutrons

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:10%
together through
fusion producing

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.920 align:middle line:10%
mostly hydrogen, helium,
and a little lithium atoms.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
These first atoms
form into clouds

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.810 align:middle line:84%
of hot ionized plasma
that begin to accumulate

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
in those alchemical vessels
of higher mass density.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
This forms the beginnings
of nebulae and galactic

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:90%
superstructures.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:84%
This also marks the
shift from photons

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
to matter being the main
driver of the macrocosm.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.079 align:middle line:84%
All the stages described
so far happened

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:84%
within about the first 10
seconds after the Big Bang.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:10%
After this first 10 seconds,
the Photon Era dominates

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.890 align:middle line:10%
and the universe remains
this hot and opaque plasma

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:10%
for hundreds of
thousands of years.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not until 377,000
years after the Big Bang

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
that another significant
shift occurs.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Here, the temperature finally
dropped enough for electrons

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.880 align:middle line:84%
to bind with atoms
for the first time,

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
becoming neutral in charge.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:84%
This then cleared
the way for photons

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
to freely flow through space,
unimpeded for the first time.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
At this point, the universe
becomes transparent to light.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Initially, this radiation would
have been visible to the eye

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:90%
as a pale yellow-orange color.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.120 align:middle line:84%
But with expansion and
cooling, the frequency

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.510 align:middle line:84%
has dropped to the radio
wave range by today.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
These photons however,
still carry information

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:90%
about the early universe.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:10%
This forms what is called the
cosmic microwave background

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:10%
radiation.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:10%
And scientists have been imaging
this afterglow from the Big

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.940 align:middle line:10%
Bang with increasing
precision, giving us

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.990 align:middle line:10%
a glimpse into the fundamental
structure of the universe.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.390 align:middle line:10%
All in all, the density
fluctuation maps

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:44.350 align:middle line:10%
validate the predictions made
by Big Bang inflation models.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
How does this event line
up with the tree of life?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:10%
Well, this point
corresponds very nicely

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.280 align:middle line:10%
with the center of the tree
of life known as beauty, which

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.650 align:middle line:10%
happens to be yellow in color.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It's about balance
and it shows us

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.680 align:middle line:84%
the image of the original
spark that initiated

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:90%
the whole creation process.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:84%
The next significant
step brings us

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to victory on the tree
of life at the bottom

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:90%
of the pillar of force.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Hundreds of millions of years
after the Big Bang, gravity

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
forms the earliest
galaxies and stars.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The stars again, are
the alchemical furnaces

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:84%
that fuse the heavier
elements up to iron,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
including the elements
necessary for life.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
After a few million years,
the first generation

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.030 align:middle line:84%
stars explode as supernova,
forming even heavier elements

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
beyond iron and
seeding the universe

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
for later generations of
stars, galaxies, and clusters

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:90%
of galaxies.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:84%
This epic lasts about
one billion years

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:90%
after the Big Bang.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.490 align:middle line:84%
About 8 billion years
later, newer stars

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.990 align:middle line:84%
attract cosmic dust and
space rocks into their field.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:84%
These ultimately form into
the planets and solar systems

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:90%
we see today.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Our Earth, which is about
4.5 billion years old,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:90%
formed during this time.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.290 align:middle line:10%
And we can correlate
this formation

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:10%
of planets and solar systems
to the sphere known as glory

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:10%
on the tree of life,
which sits at the bottom

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:10%
the pillar of form.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
As we again come to the
middle pillar of the tree

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:84%
to a sphere known as
foundation, the universe's

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.080 align:middle line:84%
macrocosmic behavior
shifts a third time.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.690 align:middle line:90%
Originally, photons dominated.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Then matter took over and
gravity slowed down expansion.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But as expansion continued,
this effect diminished.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
At about 9.8 billion
years after the Big Bang,

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:84%
the expansion of the universe
began to speed up again.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.930 align:middle line:90%
This baffled scientists.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.600 align:middle line:90%
What's causing the acceleration?

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.350 align:middle line:84%
It's some kind of mysterious
anti-gravity field

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:84%
that scientists have
labeled dark energy.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
On the tree of life, this
point where that dark energy

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.490 align:middle line:84%
starts to speed up the
expansion of the universe

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.610 align:middle line:84%
again corresponds to the
foundation of the universe.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And in Kabbalah, foundation
relates to the will.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.800 align:middle line:84%
The final step in our
cosmological journey

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.170 align:middle line:90%
is the birth of life.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:10%
This brings us to the bottom of
the middle pillar on the tree

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:10%
into a sphere known as
the kingdom of Earth.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.040 align:middle line:10%
All the energies and
elements from the universe

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:10%
funnel down into
this last sphere,

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.380 align:middle line:10%
manifesting the fruit
that was originally

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:10%
contained within the seed.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Just as the universe
began in a hot plasma,

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:49.730 align:middle line:84%
life is thought to have begun
in a hot primordial soup

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
beginning with macromolecules,
then RNA and DNA.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And over the last 3
billion years or so,

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.020 align:middle line:84%
evolving and transforming
towards more advanced life

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:90%
forms.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And here we are today,
13.8 billion years

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.830 align:middle line:90%
after the Big Bang.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:10.820 align:middle line:84%
In our new story of creation,
there is one big question

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.340 align:middle line:84%
that scientists
still struggle with--

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.020 align:middle line:90%
what started it all?

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:18.320 align:middle line:84%
What happened before
the beginning?

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Religion says God started it.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysics and
mystical teachings

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:90%
reach deeper than that.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:10%
In Kabbalah, the
source of oneness

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:31.190 align:middle line:10%
that initiated the spark and
emanated the tree of life

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:middle line:10%
is called Ein Sof.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.570 align:middle line:10%
This name means infinite,
perfect, and without end.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It is everywhere and nowhere,
kind of like the Dow.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
When Kabbalists refer
to Ein Sof as God,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.830 align:middle line:84%
we are saying everything is
divine because Ein Sof is

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:90%
in everything.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:84%
There is nowhere
that it cannot be.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:00.470 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy and hermetics,
there's a similar concept.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.070 align:middle line:84%
The one mind acts
upon prima materia,

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
which can be equated
to the quantum vacuum.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, in the Upanishads,
the Brahma acts upon Akasha.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Even in quantum physics,
we've established

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that observation is central
to manifesting things out

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:20.210 align:middle line:90%
of the quantum vacuum.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So some original observer,
an infinite eternal being,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.460 align:middle line:84%
must have existed
before the beginning

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:90%
of our physical universe.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
We can call it whatever we want,
so long as we acknowledge it

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.880 align:middle line:90%
because that is source.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.850 align:middle line:84%
And remember, that
source is in us.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah says the
essence of Ein Sof

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.380 align:middle line:90%
flows through the whole tree.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Even though we might perceive
a diverse spectrum of colors,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.740 align:middle line:84%
the light is all from one
source and of one essence.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
This whole cosmology
of Kabbalah, of course,

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.990 align:middle line:84%
traces the cause
of creation back

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.930 align:middle line:90%
to a divine source, the Ein Sof.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists today would
like to invoke the many worlds'

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.880 align:middle line:84%
interpretation of
quantum mechanics

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate the need for an
original observer, or source.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:10%
They say that in a multiverse,
all possible universes

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:10%
are being created
constantly and there

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:10%
is no need for a divine source.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But metaphysics also
works with the idea

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
of multiverses and
parallel worlds

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.540 align:middle line:84%
while still including
universal consciousness,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.440 align:middle line:84%
or eternal spirit, into
the infinite multiverse.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
After all, Ein Sof is
eternal and infinite.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Its home is the multiverse.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But again, before we can hope
to understand the multiverse,

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:84%
we must first understand
this universe we live in.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And as much as the scientists
have tried to do this,

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.380 align:middle line:84%
they still don't
understand what makes up

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:90%
the majority of our universe.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
All the matter and light that
we've discussed and described

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:84%
so far makes up less
than 5% of our universe.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:84%
How can anyone possibly
claim that spirit,

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.710 align:middle line:84%
or some divine source, doesn't
exist when they don't even

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%
know what most our
universe is made of?

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.320 align:middle line:84%
Through a combination of
astrophysics observations

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple of
decades, scientists

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:84%
have had to face the fact that
less than 5% of the universe

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.090 align:middle line:90%
is made of ordinary matter.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.540 align:middle line:84%
They have spent
their entire careers

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.780 align:middle line:84%
on trying to understand
this matter only

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:84%
to discover that the
majority of the universe

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:84%
is made of something
else entirely.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
According to the latest data
from the Planck satellite,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.180 align:middle line:84%
which precisely measured the
cosmic microwave background

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.840 align:middle line:84%
radiation left over from
the Big Bang, less than 5%

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:84%
is ordinary matter,
like the kinds addressed

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.920 align:middle line:84%
in the standard
model of physics,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:84%
while 27% is what
they call dark matter,

00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and the other 68% is
called dark energy.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:84%
What are these dark things that
make up 95% of our universe?

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
First, let's establish,
why are they called dark?

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
They're called dark because they
don't produce any photons thus,

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.100 align:middle line:84%
we can't directly observe them
through our current methods.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
We can only infer
their presence based

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:84%
on other observations,
especially in relation

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to gravity and the expansion
rate of our universe.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with dark matter.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:90%
How do we know it exists?

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.160 align:middle line:84%
The primary evidence comes
from observations of galaxies.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.020 align:middle line:84%
A couple of maverick
astronomers were

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.780 align:middle line:84%
measuring rotational
speeds of galaxies,

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.120 align:middle line:90%
including our own Milky Way.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
They noticed that the galaxies
were moving so fast that they

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.830 align:middle line:90%
should fly apart.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
account for this is

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that they must have
more mass or something

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:90%
holding them together.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.600 align:middle line:84%
Calculations
showed, for example,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.090 align:middle line:84%
that the Milky Way should be
10 times more massive to rotate

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.590 align:middle line:90%
the way it does.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.440 align:middle line:84%
This means 90% of
the Milky Way's mass

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.810 align:middle line:90%
was due to dark matter.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.850 align:middle line:84%
These observations
have been confirmed

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.100 align:middle line:84%
by other types of
measurements, as well,

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
and scientists are
quite confident, by now,

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.360 align:middle line:90%
that dark matter exists.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.950 align:middle line:90%
The question is, what is it?

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of it could be ordinary
matter that is just very dim,

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.870 align:middle line:84%
such as burned out
stars and black holes.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But the leading
proposals say that it

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:37.490 align:middle line:84%
must be some kind of elusive
new form of elementary particles

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:90%
yet to be discovered.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.830 align:middle line:84%
They must be massive to have
such strong gravitational

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.730 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Yet they must also
be weakly interacting

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.300 align:middle line:84%
with all other forms of
matter in all other ways.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
String theorists
have proposed that it

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:57.080 align:middle line:84%
is a type of supersymmetric
particle called a neutralino.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's predicted to
have mass, no charge,

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.070 align:middle line:90%
and is weakly interacting.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And their calculations
show that it

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.290 align:middle line:84%
could account for the
whole 27% of dark matter,

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.070 align:middle line:90%
but the jury is still out.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, it is crucial to
helping the stars and galaxies

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.720 align:middle line:90%
form and stay together.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Experts believe it is
ubiquitous in the universe

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and that it has a strong
influence on cosmic structure

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.780 align:middle line:90%
and evolution.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.000 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
had a critical role

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.730 align:middle line:84%
in helping form the
cosmic structure

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.390 align:middle line:84%
and determine where the stars
and galaxies have their birth

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.180 align:middle line:84%
was those density fluctuations
from the early universe.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.270 align:middle line:84%
These functioned like alchemical
vessels in a cosmic laboratory

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:47.120 align:middle line:84%
or like those little wombs
in the fabric of space-time.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Could dark matter
be related to these?

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.350 align:middle line:84%
If so, that would mean it
has a more feminine quality

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
of contraction, or
formation, according

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:90%
to kabbalistic principles.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.150 align:middle line:90%
What about dark energy?

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:84%
What is this mysterious thing
that makes up almost 70%

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:90%
of our universe?

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.770 align:middle line:84%
Since the 1990s, astronomers
have discovered and confirmed

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that the expansion of the
universe is speeding up.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Measurements have estimated
that when the universe was half

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:21.410 align:middle line:84%
its present age, there was a
shift in the expansion rate.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:10%
It went from slowing
down due to gravity

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:10%
to gradually speeding up.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.690 align:middle line:10%
There must be some
form of energy

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.940 align:middle line:10%
causing this acceleration.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have labeled
this dark energy

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.800 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
measure it directly.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:42.410 align:middle line:84%
So dark energy is an
energy of expansion.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:47.120 align:middle line:84%
It's like the pressure that
causes a balloon to inflate.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
We can think of matter
and its gravitational pull

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.450 align:middle line:84%
as being contractive, or it
puts on the brakes to expansion,

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.760 align:middle line:84%
while dark energy is
like the gas pedal.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Where is dark energy
located in the universe?

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:84%
It is thought to uniformly
permeate all of space.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Unlike dark matter, it
doesn't accumulate anywhere

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:84%
in particular thus, its
density is very low, much less

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.900 align:middle line:84%
than the density of matter
found within galaxies.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But because it uniformly
fills empty space,

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:28.510 align:middle line:84%
this subtle energy can have
a profound collective effect

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.010 align:middle line:90%
on the universe as a whole.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.850 align:middle line:90%


00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.460 align:middle line:90%
What do scientists think it is?

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:84%
The most likely
candidate is that it

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.820 align:middle line:84%
is the energy of the quantum
vacuum in empty space,

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.780 align:middle line:90%
the zero-point energy.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The main debate is whether
it is a scalar field

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:49.660 align:middle line:90%
or a cosmological constant.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The cosmological
constant was first

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:90%
introduced by Einstein in 1917.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Since E equals mc squared,
general relativity

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:02.160 align:middle line:84%
predicts that a non-zero
vacuum energy should

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:90%
have a gravitational effect.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.530 align:middle line:84%
However, Einstein
abandoned this idea

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.610 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmological constant,
calling it his biggest blunder.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Guess what, Einstein?

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:16.080 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't have been
so quick to dismiss it.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.680 align:middle line:84%
The main difference between
the cosmological constant

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and a scalar field hypothesis
is whether the energy density

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.340 align:middle line:84%
is homogeneous and
constant or whether it

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.830 align:middle line:90%
varies in space and time.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.440 align:middle line:84%
One dynamic scalar
field proposed

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.930 align:middle line:90%
has been called quintessence.

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.800 align:middle line:84%
The latest results of
the Planck satellite

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.910 align:middle line:84%
say there's no evidence of
a dynamically varying dark

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.090 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.010 align:middle line:84%
However, what if
this dark energy

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:46.800 align:middle line:84%
is from the same
source that caused

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
the inflationary period of the
Big Bang 14 billion years ago?

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We learned that in
the first fraction

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.380 align:middle line:84%
of a second after the Big
Bang, space-time exponentially

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.750 align:middle line:90%
expanded to enormous size.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:05.200 align:middle line:84%
That required a very high
energy density at the time.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The energy driving
inflation didn't just

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:09.570 align:middle line:90%
disappear all of a sudden.

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.740 align:middle line:90%
What happened to it?

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that as
space-time expanded so rapidly

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.730 align:middle line:84%
that it also diluted this
energy density somehow?

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.760 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that the dark
energy we measure today

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.350 align:middle line:84%
is the same energy of expansion
that caused inflation.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It might only appear
to be constant to us

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.080 align:middle line:84%
now in a similar way
that space-time appears

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.030 align:middle line:84%
to be flat to us, meaning it
shows no overall curvature,

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:43.020 align:middle line:84%
even though it started out
as a tiny spherical bubble.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Scientists are not
sure if there's

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.760 align:middle line:84%
any relation between dark
energy and inflation,

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.370 align:middle line:84%
but their expansive natures sure
are reminiscent of one another.

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Could this quintessence,
the energy of the vacuum,

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.260 align:middle line:90%
be harnessed?

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla sure thought
so and wrote extensively

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:90%
on this topic.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
He was devoted to finding ways
to tap into this energy source.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:10%
Tesla said that if
we could harness

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.530 align:middle line:10%
the energies of the vacuum,
"We would have powers almost

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.440 align:middle line:10%
unlimited and supernatural."

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysically, what might
we relate this energy to?

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Recall the quantum
vacuum relates

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:90%
to the space between things.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the gap, that blank
canvas, or empty space,

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.620 align:middle line:84%
upon which all objects
are painted or observed.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.320 align:middle line:84%
It's the background
to everything.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.310 align:middle line:84%
The gap is a portal
through which source energy

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.830 align:middle line:90%
enters into our universe.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.860 align:middle line:84%
It's what triggered the
Big Bang and its inflation.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It's what's causing our current
expansion rate to speed up.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's everywhere, including
inside the atoms of our bodies.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Could this energy
of expansion be

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:04.840 align:middle line:84%
the will of Ein Sof pushing
against the unmanifest?

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.110 align:middle line:84%
Could that Ein
Sofic source be what

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:12.639 align:middle line:84%
is driving progression
and expansion onwards?

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.350 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.320 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we've worked
our way from the oneness

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to diversity through the Big
Bang and cosmology models.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.520 align:middle line:84%
That diversity came from
various shatterings,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.210 align:middle line:84%
or symmetry breaking, through
the process of creation.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Do these physical
shatterings mean

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:34.449 align:middle line:84%
that we are separate from
source and each other?

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:38.230 align:middle line:84%
While we may experience
separation at a physical level,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.870 align:middle line:90%
we are not just physical.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:90%
We are spirit.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Separation is
mostly a perception.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.600 align:middle line:84%
This world of diverse
forms is about the world

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.060 align:middle line:90%
of sensory perception.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.659 align:middle line:84%
Even though we might perceive
a spectrum of colors,

00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:01.090 align:middle line:84%
