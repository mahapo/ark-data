00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're going to
meditate on the archetypes

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.315 align:middle line:10%
of the Chariot and Strength.

00:00:31.315 --> 00:00:35.190 align:middle line:10%
And together, they help us to
harness our will and our life

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.300 align:middle line:10%
force.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:10%
The Chariot helps establish
equilibrium at all levels,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:10%
leading to greater self-mastery
and victory in life,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:10%
while Strength helps us to
balance our use of force

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.635 align:middle line:10%
with love in order
to achieve grace.

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's a
formula that you can

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
follow for invoking these two
archetypes into your life.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.510 align:middle line:84%
We'll first work with
one card at a time,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:90%
beginning with the Chariot.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, find the
Chariot card in your deck,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and if you have a
meditation stool or cushion,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.630 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that with
a table in front of you,

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and the card is
upright on the table

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.920 align:middle line:90%
so that you can look at it.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Take several deep breaths.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Relax your body, and
begin to empty your mind,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that
you bring yourself

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.045 align:middle line:84%
into a positive, or at least
a neutral state of being,

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:39.040 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing
is disturbing you,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:90%
either mentally or emotionally.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Find that state of peace
within, that stillness.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've
established that, open your eyes

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
and look at the image of the
chariot card for about five

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
to 10 minutes with
your eyes open.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Study its imagery
and its symbolism.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:90%
Take in all the details.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Really ingrain this
upon your mind.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Memorize its
features, and notice

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
all the little subtleties
that maybe you've

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:90%
even missed before.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.288 align:middle line:84%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:28.783 --> 00:07:15.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Then after those
five to 10 minutes

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of working with the card
with your eyes open,

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.210 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take it inside
and work with it in your mind.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes closed,
begin to build up

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.140 align:middle line:84%
the image of the chariot
within your mind.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And do this for
about 10 minutes.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:90%
Recall all the details.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Build up that image.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame of
the card is like a door,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and on the other
side of that door,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.770 align:middle line:84%
you see the scenery of
this card taking shape.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Bring all the details,
the symbols, the colors,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.160 align:middle line:84%
all the characters of the
card, and recreate them

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:90%
within your mind's eye.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
Once this has been firmly
established within your mind,

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.100 align:middle line:90%
let the card come to life.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Imagine walking through the
doorway into the scenery,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and let it become
a three-dimensional

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:84%

experience for you.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Allow the characters
to come to life.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Observe their
behavior for a while.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Notice what they do,
any messages they

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:26.045 align:middle line:84%
might have, and feel the
energy of the Chariot.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.788 align:middle line:84%
Sense the courage and the
strength of the charioteer.

Once you begin to
connect to this energy

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.460 align:middle line:10%
and you're feeling it
emanate within you,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.460 align:middle line:10%
then you want to merge
with the Chariot.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.190 align:middle line:10%
Become the charioteer.

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:52.870 align:middle line:10%
Imagine yourself in the
chariot, the sphinxes below you

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:10%
that you control with your mind.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:10%

When you feel this
energy integrated,

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.400 align:middle line:10%
then you're going to
stand up and actually take

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:10%
on the posture of the chariot.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:10%
Assume his archetypal form.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.490 align:middle line:10%
His body position is facing
square on, perfectly balanced

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:10%

Feel the charioteer
alive within you.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:10%
And then state this
affirmation, "I

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.670 align:middle line:10%
am the child of the
powers of the waters

we're going to now move
on to the Strength card.

So we're going to do the same
process with the Strength card,

taking out Strength,
putting it up

And then once you've worked
with all those details

and you've really
memorized the image,

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.550 align:middle line:84%
you're going to take
it inside, and you're

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.750 align:middle line:84%
going to close your eyes and
work with it in your inner mind

strength fully within your mind,

feel and see the
energy of strength,

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:90%
the grace of strength.

Imagine that doorway that leads
out to the scenery of the card.

the colors, the characters.

this is firmly established,

move through the doorway.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:49.120 align:middle line:10%
Notice also, how they
complement each other.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.900 align:middle line:10%
The Chariot stimulates your
receptivity of higher will.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:58.170 align:middle line:10%
And then Strength stimulates
your application of life force

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:02.480 align:middle line:10%
with love, strength, and grace.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.280 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we want to
take these energies

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.290 align:middle line:10%
and express them
into our outer life

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.600 align:middle line:10%
so that we can manifest them.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.310 align:middle line:10%
Different ways of
doing that include

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.410 align:middle line:10%
bringing the primary
colors of orange

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.710 align:middle line:10%
and yellow into your
environment or into the clothes

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.330 align:middle line:10%
that you wear.

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:21.020 align:middle line:10%
Also, continue meditating daily
on the symbols and the images

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.420 align:middle line:10%
of these two cards
for the next week,

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:10%
and work with the affirmations
that we just used.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.000 align:middle line:10%
Keep contemplating the
meaning of each card

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.540 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies
into your life.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And then watch
for the archetypes

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.080 align:middle line:84%
to appear in your life,
whether in your dreams

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:84%
or other synchronicities,
and analyze their messages.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:41.930 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.170 align:middle line:84%
Also, really take note of
how you embody the strengths

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and weaknesses of each
one of these archetypes,

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:52.350 align:middle line:84%
and consciously work to make
improvements in these areas.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And again, realize that when
we work with the archetypes,

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
they will set forces
in motion in our life.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to engage with
this in an experiential way,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:84%
then really commit to seeing
it all the way through.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to work
with each archetype

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.380 align:middle line:84%
in the particular
sequence that is

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.860 align:middle line:84%
given as we go through this
season of "Mystery Teaching."

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.660 align:middle line:90%
So don't skip steps.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Do them one at a time, and
really give it your attention.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.750 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of tarot and how

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.600 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.
