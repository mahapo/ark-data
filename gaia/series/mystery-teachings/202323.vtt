00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.784 align:middle line:90%

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:20.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:10%
Now, today, we're going to
meditate on the archetypes

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.110 align:middle line:10%
of The Sun and Judgment Day.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.350 align:middle line:10%
Together, they bring us
regeneration and realization.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, The Sun also brings
us a renewed sense

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:10%
of joy, vitality, and
usefulness, while Judgment

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:10%
awakens us to a higher
spiritual awareness that

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:10%
can revolutionize our lives.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's a formula
you can follow

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.450 align:middle line:84%
for invoking these two
archetypes of The Sun

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:90%
and Judgment into your life.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.095 align:middle line:84%
We'll first work with one at a
time, beginning with The Sun.

00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So once you're ready, find
The Sun card in your deck

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.455 align:middle line:84%
And then, place this card in
front of you at eye level.

00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:06.955 align:middle line:84%
You can sit on your
meditation stool

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:10.000 align:middle line:84%
or cushion and place
the card up on a table,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.850 align:middle line:84%
so that you can see
it at eye level.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, get yourself
into a relaxed position

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and a light meditative state.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Take several deep
breaths, relax your body,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.530 align:middle line:84%
empty out your thoughts, and
bring yourself into a positive,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
or at least a neutral,
state of being,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing's
disturbing you,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:90%
either mentally or emotionally.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And just really taking
some time to bring yourself

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
into a state of peace
and quiet within.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:84%
Once you've connected into
that state of inner peace,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.250 align:middle line:84%
open up your eyes and
look at The Sun card

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
for about 5 to 10 minutes,
with your eyes open.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Study its imagery
and its symbolism.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Take in all the details.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Memorize it.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Commit it in and ingrain
it into your mind.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Contemplate all the meaning
of the symbols and the details

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:90%
as you study it.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And really look for any
subtleties or things

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
you hadn't noticed before,
any connections that

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:90%
start to reveal themselves.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:07:10.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, after those
first 5 to 10 minutes

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of working with this key
with your eyes open, next,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
we want to take it inside and
work with it in your mind.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Take it inside and
close your eyes

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and work with it for
another 10 minutes,

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
building this image
up in your mind

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:90%
and establishing it firmly.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the
frame of a card is

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
a doorway and on the
other side of that door

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
is the scenery and the
imagery of this key.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:10%
Again, create all the details
within your mind's eye,

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:10%
all the colors, all the
characters, all the symbolism,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:10%
bringing it fully
anchored into your mind.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:90%


00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.020 align:middle line:10%
And then, once you
firmly establish this

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:10%
within your mind,
let it come to life.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that this
doorway is now something

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:10%
that you can walk through.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:10%
And as you walk in,
the scenery takes

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:10%
on a three-dimensional, virtual
reality-type of experience.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.590 align:middle line:10%
Everything comes to
life, the characters,

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.100 align:middle line:10%
all the various expressions
of consciousness come to life.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.740 align:middle line:10%
And stand there and
observe for a while.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:10%
Just take it all in.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:10%
Notice what they do.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:10%
Notice how they behave,
any messages or words

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.830 align:middle line:10%
they might speak or transmit.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And especially feel the
energy that the sun emanates.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.170 align:middle line:10%
And feel the joy of the child.

00:08:41.170 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:10%
When you feel the connection
to the scenery and the energy,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:10%
the next step is to
merge with The Sun.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.710 align:middle line:10%
Become The Sun.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.820 align:middle line:10%
See yourself as The
Sun, that bright ball

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.350 align:middle line:10%
of fire shining up high in
the sky, down upon the Earth,

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.720 align:middle line:10%
giving life and
warmth to the planet,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.390 align:middle line:10%
bringing joy and happy times.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.940 align:middle line:10%
You might also see yourself as
the child on the horse, full

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:10%
of freedom, joy, pleasure.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel integrated
with these energies,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.500 align:middle line:10%
stand up and actually
take on the posture,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:10%
beginning with the
child in The Sun key.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:10%
Assume this archetypal
form and his body position.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.680 align:middle line:10%
Imagine yourself riding
that white horse,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:10%
holding a victory flag in your
left hand and your other hand

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.530 align:middle line:10%
is out waving in celebration.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.650 align:middle line:10%
And you feel completely
free and joyful.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:10%
Feel and see The Sun also
shining down upon you

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:10%
from above.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.120 align:middle line:10%
Feel its warmth and its
radiating light fill you.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:10%
And also, activate the sun
that is within your own heart.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.860 align:middle line:10%
And then, expand that
light from your heart out.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.775 align:middle line:10%
And now, become The Sun itself.

00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:10.525 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel this
energy filling you,

00:14:10.525 --> 00:14:12.860 align:middle line:10%
you will state this
affirmation out loud.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:10%


00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:20.330 align:middle line:10%
"I am the lord of the
fire of the worlds."

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.825 align:middle line:10%
"I am the light
and joy of life."

00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:10%
Allow that to reverberate
throughout you.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:10%
Let it awaken its
energies within yourself.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:10%
Let all the cells of your body
resonate with this energy.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:15:46.673 align:middle line:90%


00:15:46.673 --> 00:15:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, when
you're ready, we're

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
going to now move on
to the Judgment card

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and do the same process.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:84%
To take out your Judgment
key and put The Sun aside

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:90%
for a moment.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.710 align:middle line:84%
And place the key
in front of you

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
where you can see it with your
eyes open and meditate upon it.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to begin with
5 to 10 minutes of meditating

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.320 align:middle line:84%
upon the Judgment key,
with our eyes open.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:10%
Setting all the details,
memorizing the imagery,

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.540 align:middle line:10%
ingraining it upon your mind,
contemplating the meaning

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.800 align:middle line:10%
of each of the symbols,
noticing various connections

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:10%
and correspondences, and
any subtle details you

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:10%
might have missed before.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.645 align:middle line:10%
Remember the colors of this key.

00:16:32.645 --> 00:21:20.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, after that
first 5 to 10 minutes

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:84%
of studying it with
their eyes open,

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.590 align:middle line:84%
it's time to take
it inside and work

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
within your mind's eye
for another 10 minutes,

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.410 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes closed.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.050 align:middle line:84%
Recreate the image
in your mind, again,

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.362 align:middle line:84%
imagining that the frame of
the card is like a doorway.

00:21:38.362 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of that door,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:84%
you see the imagery of
the card taking form.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:10%
Build up the imagery in all of
its detail within your mind's

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:10%
eye.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.320 align:middle line:10%
And continue working with
this for about 10 minutes.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:26:46.640 align:middle line:90%


00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.060 align:middle line:10%
Once you really feel this
energy is established

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.790 align:middle line:10%
and you have the image
firmly in your mind,

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.040 align:middle line:10%
now let it come to life.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.990 align:middle line:10%
Walk through the
doorway and move

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.220 align:middle line:10%
into the scenery of
the Judgment key.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:10%
Let it take on that
three-dimensional, virtual

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.610 align:middle line:10%
reality-type of experience.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.940 align:middle line:10%
This one actually holds a
higher vibration than just

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.350 align:middle line:10%
normal 3D reality.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:10%
It feels like you're in
an alternate reality.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:10%
Observe the imagery for a while.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:10%
Let the beings come to life.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.460 align:middle line:10%
Notice what they do.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.100 align:middle line:10%
Notice how they behave.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they have a message
or there's words coming.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.810 align:middle line:10%
Receive all of this
and observe it.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:10%
Feel, also, the vibration, the
energies, the ways of being.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:10%
And especially
connect to that energy

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:42.530 align:middle line:10%
that's emanating out from the
archangel depicted in Judgment.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.340 align:middle line:10%
Once you feel this
energetic connection,

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.260 align:middle line:10%
now merge with Judgment.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:10%
Become the Judgment key.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.780 align:middle line:10%
You can begin by imagining
yourself rising up

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:10%
out of the coffin and
reaching yourself up

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.790 align:middle line:10%
towards a new
dimension, ascending.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:10%
And then, ultimately,
as you ascend,

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:10%
merge with the archangel
in the Judgment key

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.790 align:middle line:10%
and become the archangel
who's holding that trumpet

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:14.540 align:middle line:10%
and sending out that call
for others to awaken.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.710 align:middle line:10%
Feel this energy come
alive within you.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:10%
When you feel this energy
starting to integrate,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:10%
stand up and actually
take on the posture

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.300 align:middle line:10%
of the archangel in Judgment.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.580 align:middle line:10%
Assume its archetypal
form and imagine

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:10%
yourself floating in a
cloud above the Earth,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.100 align:middle line:10%
holding that trumpet
in your hands

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:10%
and blowing into it until you
awaken the souls of Earth.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.860 align:middle line:10%
And then, from that
position, you're

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.730 align:middle line:10%
going to state this
affirmation, "I

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.580 align:middle line:10%
am the spirit of primal fire."

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.975 align:middle line:10%
"I hear the call to higher
purpose and service."

00:28:53.975 --> 00:28:56.510 align:middle line:10%


00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:59.450 align:middle line:10%
Allow that to reverberate
throughout your being,

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.760 align:middle line:10%
to activate your cells, and
integrate this energy deeper

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.560 align:middle line:10%
within you.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:30:10.235 align:middle line:90%


00:30:10.235 --> 00:30:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Then, when you feel
complete with that,

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.235 align:middle line:84%
we're now going
to work with both

00:30:13.235 --> 00:30:15.870 align:middle line:84%
The Sun and the
Judgment cards together.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So bringing them
both out, you're

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.585 align:middle line:84%
going to sit and meditate
upon them together.

00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Study all the imagery
and notice how

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:90%
they contrast with one another.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Notice any differences.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And also, notice
how they compliment

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.600 align:middle line:84%
each other and any
similarities or connections

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.020 align:middle line:90%
between these two.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.280 align:middle line:10%
The Sun stimulates joy
and a sense of renewal,

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.535 align:middle line:10%
while Judgment stimulates your
call to ascension and purpose.

00:30:47.535 --> 00:30:54.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.670 align:middle line:10%
Now, the final thing we want
to do is to take these energies

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.250 align:middle line:10%
and express them
into our outer life.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.130 align:middle line:10%
So ways that we can do that are
to bring those primary colors

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:10%
into our life, into our
environment, our clothing

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:10%
and so forth.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.500 align:middle line:10%
So that's orange for The
Sun and red for Judgment.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:10%
Also, meditate daily upon
these symbols and these images.

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.920 align:middle line:10%
And work with the affirmations
that we've just used.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.410 align:middle line:10%
And continue to contemplate
the meaning of each card

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:21.870 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.780 align:middle line:10%
Watch for these archetypes
to show up in your dreams

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.090 align:middle line:10%
and/or synchronicities
within your waking life.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.660 align:middle line:10%
And really pay attention
and analyze any messages

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.960 align:middle line:10%
that they might have for you.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, really notice and
pay attention to yourself

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:37.940 align:middle line:84%
and how the strengths and
the weaknesses of each

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:84%
of these keys show
up within you.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And then, consciously
work to make improvements

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.660 align:middle line:90%
in these areas.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And then, again,
realize that as we're

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.893 align:middle line:84%
working with these
archetypes, they're

00:31:47.893 --> 00:31:50.270 align:middle line:84%
going to set forces in
motion in your life.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So really engage with it.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Be present to it.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And commit to seeing
it all the way through.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.360 align:middle line:90%
We have one more step to go.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:10%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.310 align:middle line:10%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.500 align:middle line:10%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:90%
