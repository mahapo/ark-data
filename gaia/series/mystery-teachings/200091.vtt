We use many different
tools and methods

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.470 align:middle line:10%
to accomplish our goals in
life, and yet so often we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.110 align:middle line:10%
fall short or get stuck.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Is there such a thing
as a roadmap to life?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
the study of Kabbalah,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
there are many different
benefits in our lives.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:90%
It helps to organize the mind.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the fastest ways
to eliminate the subconscious

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.795 align:middle line:84%
backlog that fuels
our negative ego.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.230 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to master the
process of manifestation

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and more powerfully
accomplish our goals.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to deepen
our connection to source

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and recognize our gifts
and know who we truly are.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And that all sounded great
to me when I first heard it.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And yet, I was also
a little skeptical

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.140 align:middle line:84%
that any one system could do
that much on so many levels.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
But regardless of what
my mind thought about it,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I had this intuitive call, a
deeper feeling within my soul,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to pursue it.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.600 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:84%
I was in my PhD
studies at the time,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'd been
attending astrophysics

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.680 align:middle line:90%
lectures on big bang cosmology.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.255 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I just
started reading Kabbalah books.

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly,
I became impressed

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:84%
with the number of parallels I
found in Kabbalistic writings

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
about their cosmology
and the story of creation

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and how similar it was to
modern astrophysical theories.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
They used different
words and metaphors,

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:84%
but the core essence
was the same.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I thought if Kabbalist have
known this for thousands

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:84%
of years and modern science
is just coming around to it,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.140 align:middle line:84%
what else can we
learn from Kabbalah?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.640 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to take the leap
into the universal Kabbalah

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.900 align:middle line:84%
ascension journey to see
what else it had to reveal.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
I was in it more for the
knowledge and deeper concepts

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:90%
at first.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.190 align:middle line:84%
But along the way, we were
asking ourselves questions

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.840 align:middle line:84%
like who am I, what are my
gifts, where did I come from,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
where am I going, and
what's my purpose?

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And this brought
me to a point where

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
I started looking at
the deeper truths,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.770 align:middle line:84%
the state of my
relationships in my life,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:90%
and how I react to things.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.615 align:middle line:84%
And I really started looking
at myself through the journey.

00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And the universal
Kabbalah system

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
guides us through
a spiritual alchemy

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
process of accelerated
personal transformation.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I honestly can say
that without the training

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:84%
and immersion into
that ascension

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
journey up the tree of life,
I wouldn't have even known

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
what the right questions
were to ask myself.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Now the word Kabbalah
means to receive.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
It's about receiving
knowledge and illumination

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
by first asking
the right questions

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.070 align:middle line:84%
and then having those
answers revealed to us.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But in order to receive
the knowledge that

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:84%
will best serve us,
we need to learn

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.075 align:middle line:90%
to ask the right questions.

00:03:03.075 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Our progression really depends
on gaining the knowledge that's

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
going to serve us in such a way
that we can directly apply it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge for the sake of
knowledge doesn't serve us.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.480 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeking is knowledge
that leads towards progression.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, all
knowledge is within.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.320 align:middle line:84%
We just need to unlock it and
accept the true knowledge that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:90%
is already within us.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:90%
So what are the right questions?

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, the right questions
are ultimately about life.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.510 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that awaken
us to more of our potential

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:84%
so that we can master
our gifts and create

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.030 align:middle line:90%
the life we're born to live.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
The teachings delivered
through the Kabbalistic system

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.820 align:middle line:84%
are meant to help us expand our
concepts and mental framework

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.820 align:middle line:90%
of what's possible and true.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:84%
We all have purpose to
fulfill, and we're here

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
to live a joyful
and meaningful life.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered was
that all those benefits

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah talks about are things
that we find inside ourselves.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.270 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a deep
journey into our own soul

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:84%
to reclaim who we
truly are and the life

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%
we're meant to be living.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's like an
exciting expedition

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:90%
to rediscover our true power.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Now they say that Kabbalah
sets forces in motion that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.100 align:middle line:84%
have otherwise been
dormant, meaning

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.390 align:middle line:84%
it catalyzes that
transformational process

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.765 align:middle line:90%
and keeps it moving forward.

00:04:31.765 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And through ascending
the tree of life,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
it raises our
vibration step by step

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.600 align:middle line:84%
from a life consumed by
just the physical to one

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
where we've reclaimed
our divinity.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.900 align:middle line:84%
How is the Kabbalistic process
able to catalyze our evolution

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:90%
like this?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, one way to think
of it is to compare it

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to how lasers work
in a science lab.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.090 align:middle line:84%
If we take a high powered
laser and we beam it directly

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
onto an object,
it obliterates it.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.820 align:middle line:90%
It completely fries it.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.400 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to do
instead is to send it

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:90%
through a course of optics.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And these optical
lenses and mirrors act

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:84%
as filters to reduce, redirect,
and tune the frequency

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:90%
and intensity of the light.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Now these filters bring it
into the right amount of light

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
so that it delivers the desired
power to the destination.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And this process of redirecting
the light back and forth

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
through the lenses
is a good model

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
for what happens with
the tree of life.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.550 align:middle line:84%
All light and energy comes from
the highest infinite source

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.040 align:middle line:90%
called Ain Soph in Kabbalah.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
And the light is intensely
powerful and limitless.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to be reduced
before coming down

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.030 align:middle line:90%
into this physical density.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And this happens
through the operation

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
of the spheres on
the tree of life

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
which act like mirrored lenses
that filter and then ultimately

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
deliver the light
into the physical.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:84%
If all of those
lenses and filters

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.300 align:middle line:84%
are in perfect order in
their original integrity,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.420 align:middle line:84%
then the proper amount
of light is delivered.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.870 align:middle line:84%
But we often have a situation
where these lenses are not

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.510 align:middle line:90%
in their perfect state.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.360 align:middle line:90%
They're warped or cracked.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
They have dark
splotches on them.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the light flowing
down the way it's supposed to,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.075 align:middle line:90%
it gets blocked and distorted.

00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And by the time it
reaches the physical,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.125 align:middle line:84%
it's a pale shadow of
what it should have been.

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to
do is clean this up.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:90%
How do we do this?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we go through
the journey of ascension,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
we're guided through a process
of repairing the lenses so

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.053 align:middle line:84%
that the light can flow
through unobstructed.

00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And we do this by
following what's

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
called the path of the flaming
sword or the lightning bolt

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
sequence only when we're
ascending the tree of life.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:84%
We start at the bottom
and work our way up.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Because at the bottom is where
we live our physical life from.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.780 align:middle line:90%
It's where we're at.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
So we start here, and we
work our way up step by step.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And we're essentially
retracing the steps

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.435 align:middle line:84%
that the light flows on
its way down from source.

00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:16.780 align:middle line:84%
And as we retrace our steps,
we can repair, clean up,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.480 align:middle line:84%
and heal each component
of our tree of life.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.761 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And when we come to
the top were then

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
able to tap into
that limitless light.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And through the
journey, we've also

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.980 align:middle line:84%
prepared ourselves to have a
face-to-face direct experience

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:90%
with that original light.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And as we tap back
into it, it then

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.940 align:middle line:84%
starts to flow down through
our tree in a more integris way

again.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's a dual
action happening here.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.150 align:middle line:84%
We're ascending and
cleaning up the vessels.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And as we do this, our
ability to manifest our light

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.790 align:middle line:84%
into the world becomes
more powerful and clear.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
On any spiritual path,
it's important to remember

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
that we are also here
to have a physical life.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.050 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be physical
and spiritual in our approach

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:02.850 align:middle line:90%
to life.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%
It's about finding the balance.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:06.960 align:middle line:84%
But so much of our
life has gotten

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.095 align:middle line:84%
caught up in just this
physical experience.

00:08:10.095 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, we're living

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.740 align:middle line:90%
in the matrix, so to speak.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And a large majority of our
attention, time, and energy

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:84%
goes into our existence
here in the physical.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
But this is such a pale
shade of who we are

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and what we're supposed to
be living and experiencing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Our physical life should
be like a heaven on Earth,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but that can only
happen when we find

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:84%
that proper balance between
the physical and spiritual

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.759 align:middle line:84%
and then further awaken
our greater potential.

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything we know of and
experience with our five senses

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
is in this physical
density and is

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the tree of
life in what we call malchut.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:90%
What is malchut?

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the last sefirot.

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about the four
elements, the sensory world,

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.180 align:middle line:90%
and physicality.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.550 align:middle line:84%
It's about grounding
the final form

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and bringing completion
to the creative cycle.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
But here's the key.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.940 align:middle line:84%
It's the result of things
happening higher in the tree.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not the cause.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Scientific thinking
focuses on the cause

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.370 align:middle line:84%
as always happening
in the physical

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.410 align:middle line:84%
because scientists
generally don't believe

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:90%
there's anything beyond.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But according to
Kabbalah, manifestation

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:84%
is the final result of what's
happening higher in the tree.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
And the original cause
isn't here in malchut.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.460 align:middle line:84%
So if we're getting stuck in
the process of accomplishing

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.530 align:middle line:84%
our goals and we're
not liking the results,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
then we need to usually
look beyond malchut,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.028 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical
for the cause.

00:09:45.028 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:84%
If we want to change
something that's

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.930 align:middle line:84%
happening in our physical life,
journeying up the tree of life

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:84%
brings awareness to the
fullness of who we are.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:84%
We get into alignment with
our divinity and awareness

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.560 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on
in our blueprint.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.255 align:middle line:84%
And so we start to see
where the distortions are.

00:10:02.255 --> 00:10:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And We do this journey
through a process known

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:90%
as ascending the tree of life.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.235 align:middle line:84%
Now what do we
mean by ascension?

00:10:09.235 --> 00:10:10.550 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, ascension is
about raising vibration.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It's also about becoming
more multi-dimensional

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and expanded in our awareness
to go from living life

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.157 align:middle line:84%
in what we call this three
dimensional awareness to living

00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensionally.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.981 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Now what exactly does that mean?

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, our existence extends
far beyond this physicality.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:84%
So to ascend is not
to leave the body

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.060 align:middle line:84%
but to take the body with
us and expand our awareness

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
and ability to perceive
more of the full reality.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
We raise the vibration of
the physical as we ascend,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and we expand and
open up to embody more

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
of our greater
spiritual essence here

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
in this physical experience.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.740 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.422 align:middle line:84%
Now most people are only
focusing on the physical,

00:10:59.422 --> 00:11:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and they're basing
their foundation

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:90%
on ego and personality.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:84%
They're not operating
from their true self.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.470 align:middle line:84%
When we ascend, it's ultimately
about reclaiming the true self

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and living from that level
of awareness day by day.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Ascension is similar to
the concept of entrainment

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.570 align:middle line:84%
where we have this capacity
to vibrate or resonate

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:84%
at many different
frequency levels.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:84%
But here in the physical,
we tend to primarily vibrate

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:90%
at a dense level.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:90%
It's a very slow vibration.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
If we want to raise
our vibration,

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:84%
we need to introduce a
higher frequency source that

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:84%
can act as a catalyst
and driver to entrain us

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:90%
to a whole new level.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, we step up
the spectrum of vibration.

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Now if you try to
jump up the spectrum,

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
it's more difficult
to sustain that.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're gradually
turning up the heat

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:84%
rather than trying
to do it all at once.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And we go through this
process of ascension.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And, ultimately, our goal is to
awaken the whole tree of life.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And we want to bring our
consciousness into wholeness

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
and gain access to the
entire pattern rather than

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:90%
just a few pieces of it.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.820 align:middle line:84%
This isn't about
studying the tree.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:90%
It's about living it.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Each level of the tree
holds a different frequency

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
and a different set of energies
that we attune ourselves into.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.840 align:middle line:84%
So by starting in malchut,
the physical kingdom,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.840 align:middle line:84%
we're basically talking about
our life and all the results

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.190 align:middle line:90%
of our life.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This includes our fitness and
health level, where we live,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:84%
how we flow abundance,
and whether we're

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.420 align:middle line:84%
living the life that we
envision for ourselves or not.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
It's all the practical,
tangible stuff of life.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.898 align:middle line:84%
Then we set a vision for what
we want our life to look like.

00:12:51.898 --> 00:12:53.440 align:middle line:84%
What would your life
look like if you

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
were living your full potential
and accomplishing your goals

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.550 align:middle line:84%
not just from ego but from
being aligned with your greater

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:90%
purpose and true self?

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And what's getting in the way
of you realizing that vision?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.740 align:middle line:84%
The journey of ascending
the tree of life

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
is about setting these forces
in motion to clear the blocks

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.076 align:middle line:84%
and support the manifestation
of our ultimate life.

00:13:16.076 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Now as we ascend
beyond malchut, we

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.300 align:middle line:84%
move into the next
level of the tree.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
The lower triad corresponds with
what we call our lower self.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.880 align:middle line:84%
It includes our personality
and the way our mind works.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
It's also our emotions
and intellectual side.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.860 align:middle line:90%
It's both the IQ and the EQ.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.470 align:middle line:84%
It's also our subconscious
patterns and habitual

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.630 align:middle line:90%
way of life.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And here we start
taking a look at where

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:90%
we've created attachments.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
mentally, emotionally,

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
or in relationships,
we start asking

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
where have I created
attachments that aren't serving?

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Where do we have attachments
that pull my energy?

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And where do I
give my power away?

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.036 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:00.036 --> 00:14:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Now on the other hand, we
also ask where am I strong?

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:90%
What are my gifts and talents?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.635 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to do to
achieve a greater balance?

00:14:08.635 --> 00:14:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And we start to
see where we're out

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.780 align:middle line:84%
of balance between our left
and our right brain functions,

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.870 align:middle line:84%
between the logic
and the intuition

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.355 align:middle line:84%
and where there might
be cracks or imbalances

00:14:19.355 --> 00:14:20.155 align:middle line:90%
in our foundation.

00:14:20.155 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:84%
This is all the lower self
and the personality level

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.160 align:middle line:90%
of the tree of life.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:84%
Now before we go
any further, let

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.780 align:middle line:84%
me clarify that the lower
self and the personality

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.850 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to what many think,
the personality is not needed.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.380 align:middle line:10%
It's often misunderstood
as a good thing,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:10%
but here we're defining
the personality

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:10%
as the learned behaviors and
coping mechanisms that we've

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:10%
been programmed with in life.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It becomes the
masks that we wear,

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:90%
so it's not our true self.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Now the problem is we've
adopted these coping strategies

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.700 align:middle line:90%
because they've worked for us.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.090 align:middle line:84%
But we develop them
within a limited context.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
They're not really
serving us because they

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.920 align:middle line:84%
get in the way of
our full potential.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.510 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, our coping
strategies and masks

Our true self is our
individuality, which

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is different from personality.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.585 align:middle line:84%

[VOCALIZING]

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:84%
We have attachments to how
people may perceive and judge

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.620 align:middle line:84%
us, and so we hold back and
develop these personality

Now when we talk about the

or the cracks in
the mirrors, this

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.300 align:middle line:84%
is the personality stuff
that's fueled by negative ego.

It limits what we can
accomplish because we're

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.310 align:middle line:84%
holding onto these
fears and attachments.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And to clean this up, we must
let go of the attachments

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:84%
and begin to remember where
we form these belief systems

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:90%
or behaviors in the first place.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
We must tell ourselves the
truth about what we believe

that's true or not.

And when we start to
ask these questions,

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.010 align:middle line:84%
it's about evaluating
whether we're living life

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:90%
with integrity or not.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We want to let go of the
ways in which we resist

our own progression or engage

And a big part of the
journey of ascension

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.260 align:middle line:84%
is about really
looking at all of this

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.510 align:middle line:90%
and cleaning it up as we go.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.760 align:middle line:84%
We're unearthing it
from the subconscious

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and becoming more aware.

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:84%

and evaluating it

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:43.186 --> 00:16:46.320 align:middle line:84%
And as we do, our lower
self becomes more and more

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
a true reflection or more
transparent to our higher self.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.210 align:middle line:84%
What's the intended
role of the lower self?

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Does it have any
positive aspects to it?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, the
lower self is meant

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:84%
to take that light, the
visions, and creative energy

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:84%
flowing in from the higher
self and organize it.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.380 align:middle line:84%
It's the functions of our
mind that put more detail

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.670 align:middle line:90%
into our creative process.

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:84%

and at a very practical level

as well.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:84%
It's the part of us that has
the ability to focus and harness

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
the creative energies
in order to bring them

into physical manifestation.

Now the operations at this
part of the tree of life

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:90%
are really magical.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.630 align:middle line:84%
We're meant to
create powerfully.

We're meant to harness
our mind and tap

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.010 align:middle line:90%
into passion and creativity.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:84%

to make things
happen in this world.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So we call this
the realm of magic,

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
magic being the process
of taking those energies

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.090 align:middle line:84%
from the higher realms
and flowing them down

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
into the physical to
actually manifest.

We're not talking about
Harry Potter style

magic that happens

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:84%
through our creative efforts
and the work of harnessing

our skills and our mind.

And, yet, it can defy logic.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to master this
level of the tree of life,

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.620 align:middle line:84%
our ability to make things
happen can seem miraculous.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:15.224 --> 00:18:19.550 align:middle line:84%
Now this lower triad involves
harnessing our practical self,

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.570 align:middle line:84%
interfacing with the world,
creating, manifesting,

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and making things happen.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.618 align:middle line:84%
We can live a magical life when
we clean up our personality

00:18:29.618 --> 00:18:31.160 align:middle line:84%
and get this part
of the tree of life

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to be in a state of
balance and integrity.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.380 align:middle line:10%
Next, we come to the
midpoint on the tree of life,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.856 align:middle line:10%
and this brings us into
tiferet, which means beauty.

00:18:42.856 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:10%
Tiferet is the
middle of the tree.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.380 align:middle line:84%
It mediates between the
above and the below.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:10%
It's the point of union between
our lower self and our higher

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:10%
self.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.490 align:middle line:10%
And what's amazing
about the sefirot

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:10%
is that every other sphere on
the tree of life except malchut

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.050 align:middle line:10%
is directly
connected to tiferet.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:84%
When we first encountered this
part of the tree, the focus,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.550 align:middle line:90%
though, is about healing.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
Now on this journey, we're
discovering and unearthing

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:90%
new levels of awareness.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We're realizing the blocks
or the mental and emotional

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:90%
attachments that get in the way.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And as we come to this greater
self-awareness and realization,

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and we reach a point where we
need to heal the old patterns

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and the wounds that cause those
attachments in the first place.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So we start by asking,
why am I this way?

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:90%
When did this first start?

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.600 align:middle line:84%
What beliefs got established,
and are they really true?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:44.005 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Now the part of us
that needs healing

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.580 align:middle line:84%
is often connected with what
we call the inner child.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
distortions and the hurts that

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.970 align:middle line:90%
came in during childhood.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.870 align:middle line:84%
And these were due
to traumas or events

00:19:56.870 --> 00:20:00.570 align:middle line:84%
that we didn't know how
to understand at the time.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And now from our
adult self today, we

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:84%
might look back and say, well,
that wasn't such a big deal.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.250 align:middle line:84%
But from the child's
perspective, it was a big deal.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.120 align:middle line:84%
And we listen to an honor
that child's experience,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
and then we bring in love,
nurturing, and self-care,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and we can begin to help our
inner child heal and move on.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:84%
We start to recognize the
beauty within and reclaim

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:90%
our self-worth and confidence.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
This is typically
the first stage

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.850 align:middle line:90%
of our experience in tiferet.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.340 align:middle line:10%
But it has so many
other influences

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:10%
flowing into it from
all the other parts

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.250 align:middle line:10%
of the tree of life.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.740 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't stop there.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Tiferet is very dynamic.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot
happening here, and we

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:51.170 align:middle line:84%
go through very different phases
at this part of the journey.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
The first phase is that healing,
nurturing, and reclaiming joy.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And in this process, we
also start to connect more

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:90%
with our higher self.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.570 align:middle line:84%
But the second phase
of tiferet Fred

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.150 align:middle line:84%
has to do with sacrifice
and understanding

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:90%
the need for sacrifice.

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Here we're talking
about sacrificing

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.260 align:middle line:84%
the lesser for the
greater or letting

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.770 align:middle line:84%
go of the old ways of being
that hold us back in order

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.080 align:middle line:90%
to create room for the new.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes it's
friendships or maybe places

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.190 align:middle line:84%
we used to hang out or
daily habits that we had.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
But we realize that these
relationships or habits just

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:90%
aren't in alignment anymore.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And we sacrifice and
we let go of these

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.325 align:middle line:84%
in order to move forward
towards our greater potential.

00:21:38.325 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And, hopefully,
we can find a way

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:90%
to do so with poise and grace.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
Sacrifice can be hard
when we get hung up

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.080 align:middle line:84%
on the sense of
loss or attachment.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
A healing comes
through here again

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.970 align:middle line:84%
to support us with that
letting go process,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and this frees us up to
rise to something greater

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.790 align:middle line:90%
and more true to our soul.

Now the third
phase of tiferet is

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.630 align:middle line:84%
to become like the
ascended king or queen,

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.660 align:middle line:84%
meaning we start to thrive
in our sense of alignment

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
with our true self, our
worth, and our divinity.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
We step more into a phase of
self-leadership in our life,

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to embody
our higher self more.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.860 align:middle line:84%
We embrace a greater sense
of dignity and nobility

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's not to say that
we've fully mastered it

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:84%
at this stage, but we're
making great strides

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:90%
towards getting there.

And the full attainment
of this comes later

after completing the journey
all the way up the tree of life.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Now the virtue that
we seek to cultivate

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:84%
at this stage of the
journey is called devotion

00:22:42.795 --> 00:22:44.655 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a
deep inner devotion

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to continuing forward on
our path of progression

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.480 align:middle line:84%
despite any obstacles that
we may face until we truly

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:90%
reclaim our divinity.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.180 align:middle line:84%
It's to reach our full
potential not just

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.210 align:middle line:84%
settling for what's
good enough or settling

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.540 align:middle line:84%
for any kind of mediocrity
but rather to be the greatest

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.400 align:middle line:90%
that we can be.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.350 align:middle line:84%
We move forward with
an attitude of I'm

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.720 align:middle line:84%
committed to completing
this journey no matter what.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
keep going until I

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.240 align:middle line:90%
become the best I can be.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
It's also not a one time thing.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.760 align:middle line:84%
We can always continue
growing and evolving

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
at the next level meaning
devotion to the great work

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.250 align:middle line:84%
becomes a way of life that
embraces constant growth

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.050 align:middle line:90%
and progression.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:36.100 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like the
Japanese principle of kaizen

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.650 align:middle line:84%
which means making
changes for the better.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.070 align:middle line:84%
Only here we're talking about
spiritual inner improvement

00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:43.480 align:middle line:90%
rather than just outer ones.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the path to
self-mastery which

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.380 align:middle line:84%
is needed in order to accomplish
our greater service and purpose

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's not selfish to
strive towards this

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
because ultimately it's
about how we can better

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.675 align:middle line:90%
serve the whole.

00:23:58.675 --> 00:24:00.898 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:00.898 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
Now before we move on, let's
summarize this bottom half

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.790 align:middle line:84%
of the tree and
give it some context

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:90%
that we're more familiar with.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:84%
The lower part of the
tree is very practical,

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and most people have their
focus on these realms.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.400 align:middle line:84%
For those who are just
focused on the physical,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:84%
well, then they're
stuck in malchut.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.130 align:middle line:84%
But many have stepped onto
this path of personal growth

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and are trying to improve
their inner life as well.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:29.845 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're exploring
dreams in the psychology

00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:33.910 align:middle line:84%
of the subconscious, or they're
advancing in their skill sets

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.605 align:middle line:90%
in mental and emotional healing.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.850 align:middle line:84%
There are many tools and
approaches in our world today

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.910 align:middle line:84%
that can be used to support
such personal growth.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And what's so powerful
about Kabbalah,

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.170 align:middle line:84%
though, is that
there are tools that

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:49.900 align:middle line:84%
are not so commonly
accessible and which

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.385 align:middle line:90%
can take us even further.

All of the peak performance

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
today is usually working
with tiferet and below.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
It's working with psychology,
motivation, creativity,

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.570 align:middle line:84%
strategies for
success, and so on.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.080 align:middle line:84%

half of the tree.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.110 align:middle line:10%
Now as we go up
from tiferet, we're

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.600 align:middle line:10%
working with more
spiritual principles,

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:20.100 align:middle line:10%
deeper aspects of the soul
and mystical experiences.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:84%
Only through that
work do we come

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
into the fullness of
who we are and who we

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.390 align:middle line:90%
can be in this physical life.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.990 align:middle line:84%
As we work from tiferet
up to gevurah, and chesed,

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:84%
we're now working with what
we call the individuality.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Individuality is more
like our higher self.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.360 align:middle line:90%
It's our true uniqueness.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.460 align:middle line:84%
It's who we are as an
internal spirit being.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.150 align:middle line:84%
But at this part of the
tree, our individuality

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.405 align:middle line:84%
is expressed through the
framework of the soul.

00:25:48.405 --> 00:25:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, the soul is
our operating system.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It's how we perceive
information and how

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.910 align:middle line:84%
we mediate energies between
the physical and the spiritual.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.010 align:middle line:84%
Soul is the part
of us that gives us

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
the ability to be conscious
in this physical life.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And this middle triad
brings us into the core self

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:14.400 align:middle line:84%
so that we can reclaim
more of our power and love.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.910 align:middle line:84%
As we move beyond tiferet
into gevurah and chesed,

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:84%
we aim to mature the child
self into the golden self.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.825 align:middle line:84%
It's about becoming
spiritual adults.

00:26:24.825 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a very
dynamic place on the tree

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.970 align:middle line:84%
because we're also learning
how to balance power with love

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.090 align:middle line:90%
or severity with mercy.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It's balancing between the
warrior and the healer.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Now finding the
proper balance here

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:84%
can be very challenging
because we also

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:84%
start hitting up against
our cultural programming.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.540 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Much of our more deeply
ingrained cultural programs

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
interfere with this
level of the tree.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Either we're too
much of a pacifist

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:84%
thinking we should
only be merciful

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
and giving all the time, or we
shut down our hearts to love.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Some go into being too hard,
seeking power and dominance

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.510 align:middle line:84%
over others, and they become
competitive or even cruel.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And people tend to go towards
one of these two sides

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
rather than being in the balance
of both where they vacillate

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:20.835 align:middle line:90%
between the two poles.

00:27:20.835 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, ultimately, we need equal
measure of severity and mercy

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.020 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a dynamic
balance at this level,

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and only when we find that
does our heart truly open up.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And when this triad is
healed, the heart opens up,

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and it gives us
the courage to face

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.410 align:middle line:84%
our fears, our vulnerability,
and our weaknesses.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.820 align:middle line:84%
We gain the courage
to take up that sword

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and cut away what doesn't serve
us and all of those attachments

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.670 align:middle line:90%
that hold us back.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We become willing to sacrifice
our personality in order

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.595 align:middle line:90%
to reclaim our divine self.

00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And it takes courage,
love, and self-acceptance

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.480 align:middle line:90%
to truly be ourselves.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Now when we've come to
this level on the tree,

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.265 align:middle line:84%
we've really come a long way
within our own life already.

00:28:12.265 --> 00:28:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And on a practical
level we've discovered

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.410 align:middle line:90%
a lot about ourselves.

00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
We know more of our
strengths and weaknesses,

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:84%
and we've cultivated a greater
connection through our soul.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.650 align:middle line:84%
We're more connected
to our true self,

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.650 align:middle line:84%
and we're maturing
on our journey.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet there's still a sense
of separation from the divine.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.360 align:middle line:84%
It's like the divine still feels
as if it's out there rather

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.000 align:middle line:90%
than in here on a daily basis.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.920 align:middle line:84%
We may know it's here, and we
believe it's within us too.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.590 align:middle line:84%
But we don't have that
direct experience of it being

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.690 align:middle line:90%
within us in our daily life.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.850 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, this perception of
separation is due to something

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.450 align:middle line:90%
we call the abyss.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
The abyss is this
chasm that makes

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:84%
us think that we're
separate from the divine

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.955 align:middle line:84%
and from each other and from
the circumstances of our life.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:04.461 --> 00:29:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Now what the ego does with this
is if it perceives something

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.530 align:middle line:84%
as separate from
us, then we feel

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.890 align:middle line:84%
we have to be in control or
on guard or, in other words,

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.560 align:middle line:90%
our fears arise.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to project our
fears and our shadow side

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.240 align:middle line:90%
onto the abyss.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So at this level of the tree,
there are all kinds of things

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.020 align:middle line:90%
that we need to face here.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.285 align:middle line:84%
And this journey of
ascension shows us our abyss.

00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to move
past it and go beyond,

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.700 align:middle line:84%
we have to face those fears
and shadow aspects of ourself.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is a
challenging place to be.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But through the
ascension process,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.200 align:middle line:84%
we become bolstered by divine
love, and strength, and courage

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.630 align:middle line:90%
to help us conquer our fears.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%

of the self as a divine being.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Many mysteries are revealed
at this level of the tree

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.655 align:middle line:90%
through the oral teachings.

00:30:27.655 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And we work to access and cross
the abyss through this point

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.750 align:middle line:90%
of transition called daath.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:84%
And it brings us ultimately
into the supernal triad.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.090 align:middle line:90%

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a point of
reclaiming our divinity,

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.870 align:middle line:84%
but it's a direct experience
of the divine self.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.900 align:middle line:84%
It's beautiful, and healing,
and an experience that

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.472 align:middle line:90%
is truly beyond words.

00:30:50.472 --> 00:30:53.350 align:middle line:10%
Now some traditions say that
the conscious mind can't

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.840 align:middle line:10%
go beyond gevurah and chesed.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.870 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the conscious mind
can't put words to it,

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.730 align:middle line:10%
but we can go there.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:90%
It's all part of us.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.870 align:middle line:84%
We just need the right
keys to access it

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.045 align:middle line:90%
from a place of awareness.

00:31:06.045 --> 00:31:07.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.210 align:middle line:84%
It's powerful, profound,
and extremely healing

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.180 align:middle line:90%
to experience the divine within.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.370 align:middle line:84%
No matter how
flawed we may feel,

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:21.200 align:middle line:84%
we are loved, accepted,
forgiven, and embraced

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.090 align:middle line:90%
by that divine love.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:26.420 align:middle line:84%
We are reminded of our own
divinity and our oneness

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.100 align:middle line:90%
with all.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:30.320 align:middle line:84%
When we have this
experience not only

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:33.710 align:middle line:84%
are we ready to reclaim that
divinity in our lives, what

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalist call
reclaiming our crown,

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.970 align:middle line:84%
but we also begin to
recognize that there

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
is a certain responsibility
that comes with this knowledge.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Reclaiming the crown of
our divinity brings with it

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:50.600 align:middle line:84%
a responsibility to be an
active participant in creating

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.790 align:middle line:90%
a better world through service.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.180 align:middle line:90%
Now what do we mean by service?

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, service doesn't mean we
give everything away and live

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:02.600 align:middle line:84%
an aesthetic life, nor is it
just about being a good person

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.520 align:middle line:90%
and doing kind acts.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.770 align:middle line:84%
Service is about
empowering others

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.790 align:middle line:84%
to progress toward
their divinity.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And on our path
reclaiming our divinity,

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.450 align:middle line:84%
there are others who are
early on in their process,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and we can help them
to a degree that we've

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:19.010 align:middle line:90%
walked that ground already.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.750 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Once we get to the top of
the tree, what happens next?

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
We let go of our old life,
and we then recreate ourselves

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.930 align:middle line:84%
in our world in a way that's
more true to who we really are.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We're more aware of our
purpose and potential

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and go forward into our life
ready to create a new malchut

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:90%
or a new physical life.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:84%
This new malchut
is just above keter

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.150 align:middle line:90%
on the tree above the tree.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, we
start the process again

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and we work our way
up the next tree.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
called Jacob's ladder.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is how we rise Earth up
to heaven tree by tree by tree.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there's
much more detail

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.980 align:middle line:84%
that we could go into all
of this regarding what we

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:90%
need at each step of the way.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.910 align:middle line:84%
At each sefirot on
the tree of life,

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.730 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds of
details including strengths,

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and weaknesses, vises,
virtues, benefits to be gained.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.510 align:middle line:84%
There are specific qualities,
and deeper knowledge,

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.030 align:middle line:84%
and understanding of
the spiritual forces

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.513 align:middle line:84%
that work with us in
each part of the tree.

00:33:27.355 --> 00:33:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Now this process of
ascending the tree of life,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.910 align:middle line:84%
embarking on our
journey of healing

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and reclaiming our full divinity
is one of the most important

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:37.280 align:middle line:90%
things that we're here for.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And according to Kabbalah, it's
our purpose for being here.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's an even
greater purpose behind it.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.210 align:middle line:84%
There are woundings and
shattering that the universe

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.640 align:middle line:90%
has gone through.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And as we go through
our own healing journey,

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.600 align:middle line:84%
we're helping not only
the human collective

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:84%
but we're also helping the
universe to heal and repair

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:58.565 align:middle line:90%
and ultimately ascend.
