00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
How do we find a perfect union
between creativity and reason?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.850 align:middle line:84%
The answer to that
rests at the core

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of what enables us to create
the life of our dreams.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we
dive into the archetypes

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.510 align:middle line:10%
of the Empress and the Emperor.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.540 align:middle line:10%
The Empress represents
the mother archetype

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:10%
and our experience with
mothering, nurturing,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.760 align:middle line:10%
and emotions, while the Emperor
represents the father archetype

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:10%
and our experience with
authority, leadership,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.100 align:middle line:10%
and logic.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And he teaches us
the value of reason.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:10%
Together, they
awaken the earthly

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.180 align:middle line:10%
feminine and masculine
archetypes within us.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.060 align:middle line:84%
These two archetypes are the
same as the High Priestess

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:90%
and the Magician.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Only now they're expressed
into more of a concrete world

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:90%
of experience and nature.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, these
two archetypes are

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
like the Fool's earthly
mother and father.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And they relate to Father
Sky and Mother Earth

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.340 align:middle line:90%
of ancient Shamanic traditions.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And they work together
to bring forth new life.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, on the Mandala
wheel of the 231 gates,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.130 align:middle line:10%
as it rotates clockwise
to keys 3 and 4,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.010 align:middle line:10%
we're continuing the
descent down the left side

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:10%
of the wheel.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.275 align:middle line:84%
And this descent teaches us how
to master the physical plane.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.430 align:middle line:10%
Our next step on
the hero's journey

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:10%
brings us to the Empress.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.370 align:middle line:10%
The Empress is an image
of potential fulfilled.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
She's the High Priestess.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But now she's been
impregnated by the Magician.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
No longer the virgin, she's
now an expecting mother.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything about her suggests
fertility and creativity.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
The Empress is an
embodiment of Mother Nature.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
The roots of the name
Empress originally

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:90%
means she who sets in order.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.590 align:middle line:84%
She represents the inner or
the subconscious workings

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that establish order
in the universe.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.410 align:middle line:84%
She has control over all growth
and development in the material

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.210 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Of a number associated
with the empress is 3.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And 3 is about multiplication,
increase, and generation.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Numerologically, since
1 plus 2 equals 3,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
it hints that it's the
union of the Magician, which

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.750 align:middle line:84%
is number 1, and
the High Priestess,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
or number 2, that
results in the Empress.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, when male
and female energies unite,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:90%
they produce and offspring.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Thus, 3 is the
child of this union.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, in Kabbalah,
the number 3 relates

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
to formation and production,
or the organization,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.430 align:middle line:90%
the structuring of things.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:84%
This archetypal symbol
represents the Supernal Triad,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.230 align:middle line:84%
the Trinity, the three in
one within the upper realms

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.860 align:middle line:90%
or the spiritual realms of life.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:10%
As we look at the imagery
and symbolism of the Empress,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.830 align:middle line:10%
we see a regal woman sitting
on a lush seat out in nature.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:10%
She wears a maternity
dress decorated with roses.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:10%
And these roses are
shaped like the symbol

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.070 align:middle line:10%
that we also find on
the heart-shaped shield

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:10%
near her feet.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:10%
This is the symbol of Venus.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:10%
The Empress is an embodiment
of the goddess Venus,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:10%
the goddess of love,
beauty, art, sensuality,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:10%
and childbirth.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.510 align:middle line:10%
And everything from the symbol
on the shield to the heart

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.640 align:middle line:10%
shape, the luxurious cushions,
the roses on her gown,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:10%
the pearls around her
neck, the crown of stars,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:10%
the wheat growing
around her, the beauty

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:10%
of being out in nature, all
of this represents Venus.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:10%
Now, the primary color
for Venus is green,

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.080 align:middle line:10%
which we also see
in the trees as well

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:10%
as the wreath around
her head, as well as

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.220 align:middle line:10%
on the shield with
the Venus symbol.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.580 align:middle line:10%
Now, this image depicts warmth,
and growth, and fertility,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and even sensuality.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:10%
It stands in stark
contrast to the virginity

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:10%
of the High Priestess.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.650 align:middle line:10%
But remember that
the stream that flows

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:10%
in the background
of the Empress,

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.170 align:middle line:10%
which then runs down a
waterfall and into a pool--

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.890 align:middle line:10%
that stream of water originates
from the flowing robe

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.970 align:middle line:10%
of the High Priestess.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And this represents the
stream of consciousness that

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.250 align:middle line:90%
flows through the whole deck.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.010 align:middle line:90%
And here, the stream of waters--

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:84%
it all waters the
garden of nature.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And it makes it
beautiful and fertile.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, the hair color of
the Empress is blonde,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:10%
which is similar to the Fool's.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:10%
And it represents
radiant energy.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.330 align:middle line:10%
And notice also that
the Empress has a crown.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:10%
And on her crown are 12 stars.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.420 align:middle line:10%
This symbolizes the zodiac
and the cycle of the year.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.410 align:middle line:10%
Her scepter also implies
that she rules over her abode

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.970 align:middle line:10%
within nature.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.145 align:middle line:10%
Her dominion is over
the physical plane.

00:05:43.145 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
But what is the Empress
trying to teach us?

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.940 align:middle line:10%
Well, the Empress
shows us how the union

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:10%
of masculine and
feminine polarities

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:10%
generate all of creation.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
She embodies the powers of
reproduction, regeneration,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.870 align:middle line:90%
and renewal.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:84%
As Mother Nature, she not only
represents the feminine aspect,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:84%
but the whole of
creation, everything that

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.280 align:middle line:90%
manifests in time and space.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
Nature provides all from
the Heavens to the Earth.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, within us, the Empress
represents the functions

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:84%
of our subconscious mind that
govern creative imagination.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:84%
The subconscious receives
the impulses, the images,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and the words of power
from the conscious mind,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:90%
which is the Magician.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.930 align:middle line:84%
And through our conscious use
of will and concentration,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:84%
we implant these
seeds or these ideas

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:84%
into the fertile
ground of subconscious.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
As those ideas take root, they
then go into a cycle of growth

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
beneath the surface
of our awareness.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, those ideas
will sprout and bring forth

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.580 align:middle line:84%
something new, some new
life, an epiphany, a plan,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:90%
an inspiration.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.456 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.824 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.824 --> 00:07:08.640 align:middle line:84%
But what are some other
correspondences of the Empress?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, her secret name,
her esoteric title,

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:84%
is the Daughter of
the Mighty Ones.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Mighty Ones are a
reference to the Supernal

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:90%
Triad of the divine realm.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:84%
The element that
the Empress rules

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
is the water element
within the earth element.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.250 align:middle line:84%
This is because she
is Venus or Aphrodite.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, as mentioned
already, this goddess

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
of love, Venus, Aphrodite
rules everything

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.393 align:middle line:84%
to do with love, beauty,
and creative power.

00:07:38.393 --> 00:07:39.810 align:middle line:84%
But what else do
we know about her

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:90%
from astrology and mythology?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.280 align:middle line:10%
Well, Venus is known as the
morning or the evening star,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:10%
because depending on
the orbit of Venus

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.380 align:middle line:10%
around the moon
relative to Earth,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:10%
it's either the
last star to fade

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:10%
as the sun rises or is the first
star to be seen after sunset.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Venus corresponds also to
the ancient Egyptian goddess,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Hathor, who presides
over childbirth

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.900 align:middle line:84%
and is the goddess of art,
and dance, and music, beauty,

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.260 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And legends say that men
easily fall in love with her.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And she loves the
sensory pleasures

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:84%
of good food, good
drink, good sex.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And she has this
tendency, though,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.710 align:middle line:90%
to overindulge in these things.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.860 align:middle line:84%
In astrology, Venus rules
Taurus and Libra, as well as

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
the second house of
material possessions

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.309 align:middle line:84%
and the seventh house
of partnerships.

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, depending on where
she is in your natal chart,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.140 align:middle line:84%
she represents your
values, whether it's

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.980 align:middle line:84%
valuing wealth, romance,
friendship, status,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:90%
or something else.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
Venus is all about pleasure and
reveals what we're attracted to

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:90%
or what we desire.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Other key words and qualities
associated with the Empress

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:09.820 align:middle line:84%
is to nurture, support, care,
have warmth, beauty, abundance,

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.150 align:middle line:90%
nature, fertility, and growth.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:10%
They call her the
"door of life,"

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:10%
which is basically the womb.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:84%
The Empress helps
us to understand

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:24.940 align:middle line:84%
the mysteries of birth, as
well as merging imagination

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:90%
with reality.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Any time we want to bring more
joy, more love into our life,

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.400 align:middle line:84%
or more fertility, we can
call upon the Empress.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, the strengths, again,
or the balanced expressions

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of this archetype,
they're the pure way

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
in which this archetype is meant
to express itself in our lives.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.000 align:middle line:84%
But when we distort, or block,
or have too much or too little

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.590 align:middle line:84%
of these qualities, they create
weaknesses and shadow aspects

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:90%
of this archetype.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So some of the ways that
might show up within us,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and the things to
watch out for, include

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:84%
being conceited, being
barren or infertile,

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.170 align:middle line:84%
being possessive,
any kind of failure

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.340 align:middle line:84%
to merge our creative
principles for prosperity,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.050 align:middle line:84%
may be because we
have a disbelief

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:90%
or we have doubts in them.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Also, any time where
we're feeling unattractive

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:84%
or a lack of femininity,
a lack of joy,

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
not feeling appreciated,
all of these

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.010 align:middle line:84%
are weaknesses
within the Empress.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
Could be also dwelling on
any of the pains of the past

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.400 align:middle line:84%
rather than moving on, or
holding onto that pain,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
being so focused on others that
you neglect your own self care,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
or feeling drained
and emotionally

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:90%
barren because of that.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.720 align:middle line:84%
As we recognize and acknowledge
which weaknesses and shadow

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.450 align:middle line:84%
aspects might be
showing up in us,

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.670 align:middle line:84%
we tell ourselves
the truth about that.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.820 align:middle line:84%
That's when we can then
start to transform it.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:84%
And a big part of
that spiritual alchemy

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.440 align:middle line:84%
is transforming the
shadow into light.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:84%
That happens by directly
facing it and then

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:84%
revealing the gifts and the
gold hidden within the shadow.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So as we bring the
shadow to light,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
the Empress helps us
to establish ourselves

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.192 align:middle line:84%
in relationship with
others in a harmonious way.

00:11:21.192 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And she's the part
of us that knows

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.990 align:middle line:84%
how to create what
we need and want.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.870 align:middle line:84%
She encourages us to take
time to nourish ourselves

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:84%
and others, as well as to
heal any kind of family

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.940 align:middle line:90%
relationships that need healing.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:84%
She also awakens the
creator within us.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:84%
And she helps us with
letting go of any need

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:84%
to control and to
just allow and be.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And she directs us towards
creation rather than

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.645 align:middle line:90%
destruction.

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, some other benefits
gained by working

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.460 align:middle line:84%
with the Empress
include helping us

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to illuminate various
potentials within our life.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
She encourages us to
believe in the impossible,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:90%
because nothing is impossible.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
How does the emperor show
up in our life here and now?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of the
times when you've

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.370 align:middle line:84%
either been or encountered
the Empress in life.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, as
children, the Empress

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
reflects our relationships
with our own mothers

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.041 align:middle line:84%
or other maternal
figures in our life.

00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other way that the
Empress shows up in our life

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.790 align:middle line:84%
is through our use of
creative imagination.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.520 align:middle line:84%
She's the part of
our subconscious

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
that receives the impressions
and suggestions given

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.230 align:middle line:90%
by our conscious mind.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
And our subconscious then takes
these in, gestate upon them,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and in time, gives birth to
new creative ideas and forms.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, the more you come to
recognize her influence

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.240 align:middle line:84%
in your life, the
more it will also

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:84%
help you to connect
with and awaken

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:84%
to one of your parallel
lives where the Empress is

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:90%
the dominant archetype.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:84%
What might our parallel life
be like under the archetype

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.430 align:middle line:90%
of the Empress?

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, in times past, she
would have been the queen

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:90%
or the lady of the house.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Her main roles were
in warm hospitality,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:84%
sociability, beautification,
and running a household.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But as for more
contemporary examples,

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.870 align:middle line:84%
well, an obvious
Empress is a mother,

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:84%
whether she's a mother
of her own children

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.330 align:middle line:84%
or a mother-figure
for a community.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:32.400 align:middle line:84%
But she must also learn that
true love requires boundaries.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.840 align:middle line:10%
One of our greatest
challenges is

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.320 align:middle line:10%
to find the balance of caring
for herself as much as she

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.110 align:middle line:10%
cares for others.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Possible careers might
include nurturing professions

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.980 align:middle line:84%
like being a nurse, a
doctor, or a healer.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Or her connection
to nature might also

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.890 align:middle line:84%
drive her towards farming,
or landscaping, gardening,

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.380 align:middle line:90%
or even veterinary work.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Or her sense of
beauty and creativity

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
might get channeled into
being in interior design,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
or a fashion designer, or being
an artist, or a high-end chef.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And by working with the Empress
and invoking her energies

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:84%
into your life,
you too can awaken

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.600 align:middle line:84%
your creative
imagination and love.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.410 align:middle line:10%
Let's work with
one other archetype

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:10%
and meet the Empress's
mate, which is the Emperor.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.910 align:middle line:10%
The Emperor is a
father archetype

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.160 align:middle line:10%
of masculine authority.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.620 align:middle line:10%
He represents the
masculine in the same way

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.800 align:middle line:10%
that the Empress is a
symbol of the feminine.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:84%
The Emperor's main functions
are to define, to produce,

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
to invent, to generate,
to build, and to protect

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:90%
what's his.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.710 align:middle line:84%
He relates both to
authorship and authority.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And he's, therefore, a
father-figure, a leader,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.880 align:middle line:90%
or a head of government.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the roots of
the name Emperor

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
means he who sets in order,
very similar to the Empress.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Now he rules our
conscious abilities

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
to reason and to analyze
situations, to problem-solve,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and to face life's
challenges head on.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Emperor is
ruled by number 4.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And 4 is a very
multifaceted number.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It represents stability, hard
work, building foundation,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
especially with
the four elements.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us the
four laws of physics

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:90%
that order this universe.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.530 align:middle line:84%
It's through reason that
these are accomplished,

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.260 align:middle line:84%
which suggests that there
is an intelligent mind

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.796 align:middle line:84%
behind the establishment
of those laws.

00:15:44.796 --> 00:15:48.410 align:middle line:10%
Now, as we look at the
symbolism of the Emperor,

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.440 align:middle line:10%
the first thing to
notice about the Emperor

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.280 align:middle line:10%
is that he is clad in armor,
yet he is crowned and sitting

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.900 align:middle line:10%
upon a throne.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:10%
He is the quintessential
warrior King.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.460 align:middle line:10%
And his throne symbolizes
material wealth, power,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:10%
and authority.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:10%
The color of the emperor's
throne is gray stone.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.120 align:middle line:10%
And gray is the color of wisdom.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.880 align:middle line:10%
It's a perfect union
of black and white.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:10%
So it's all about balance.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.290 align:middle line:10%
Also, his long, gray-white
beard shows his experience

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:10%
and wisdom.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And it relates him
to something we

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
call the "ancient of days"
or the "grand architect

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.116 align:middle line:90%
of the universe."

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, decorating the
throne are rams' heads.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol for
Aries, or the God of War.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:84%
We can see that he is
holding two objects, which

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:90%
both indicate leadership.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:84%
One is a scepter, and
the other is an orb.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.450 align:middle line:84%
The orb represents
dominion or rulership,

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
while the scepter is shaped
as a modified symbol of Venus,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:90%
the symbol of the Empress.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
This reveals that the Emperor's
active power to regulate

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
is really about us controlling
our use of mental images

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:90%
and creative imagination.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
It's about directing those
powers towards higher visions

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:90%
and purpose.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:10%
This symbol of the scepter also
resembles the Egyptian Ankh,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.200 align:middle line:10%
the symbol of eternal life.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:10%
Now, the main color
of the Emperor

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.990 align:middle line:10%
is red, like the color
of his outer robe,

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:10%
the color of Aries and Mars.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.980 align:middle line:10%
And also surrounding him
as a sky of red-orange,

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:39.460 align:middle line:10%
which the mountains
behind also reflect.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.770 align:middle line:10%
This is said to be the color
of the sun exalted in Aries.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with this active fire

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:90%
or yang-type energy.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.750 align:middle line:10%
But the Emperor's
inner robe is blue,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.530 align:middle line:10%
the same color as the High
Priestess's outer robe,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:10%
relating to the water
and the subconscious

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:10%
root of matter and mind.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Now, behind the
Emperor is a mountain

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.260 align:middle line:10%
and also is the stream
of consciousness

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:12.220 align:middle line:10%
that flows from the
High Priestess's robe.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:10%
Notice, also, how his eyes
are looking to the side.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:10%
This hints at the
function of sight,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:10%
which rules vision, inspection,
watchfulness, vigilance,

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.870 align:middle line:10%
examination, and
analysis, and inquiry.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, when we put him
next to the Empress

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.520 align:middle line:10%
in their numerological
order, we can also

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:10%
see that the Emperor is
looking in her direction.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:10%
Why might that be?

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, because he loves her.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.950 align:middle line:90%
What he does, he does for her.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And she represents
the good in his life.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And together, they make things
happen in the material realm.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:84%
What's the Emperor
trying to show us?

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, he is a man on a
mission, driven by a vision

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.230 align:middle line:84%
for establishing order and
success in his kingdom,

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:04.720 align:middle line:90%
which is his physical world.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:84%
His vision is guided
by reason and insight.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
Yet to fulfill it, he
must push the boundaries.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
More often than not, that means
going against the mainstream

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.860 align:middle line:84%
opinions and norms that like
to keep things how they are.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Thus, he's likely to meet
resistance from others

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.310 align:middle line:90%
as he pursues his vision.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.505 align:middle line:84%
And he needs to be ready to
fight for what he believes in

00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and to put his
strategy into action.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So fortunately, he is
protected by his armor

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:37.580 align:middle line:90%
of truth and sovereignty.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
The Emperor's secret
title or secret name--

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.920 align:middle line:90%
he actually has two of them.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
There's the "sun of the morning"
and "chief among the mighty."

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, as the "sun
of the morning,"

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.610 align:middle line:84%
it's a reference to Venus, the
morning star, or the Empress.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And as "chief among
the mighty," it

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.562 align:middle line:84%
relates to his power
and leadership.

00:19:58.562 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, the element of
the Emperor is fire.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And this relates to the
astrological correspondence,

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.390 align:middle line:84%
which we've said
already, is Aries.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, Aries is an active fire
sign embodying force and power.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the first
sign of the zodiac.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's ambitious,
assertive, and conquering.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:10%
And the god, Aries, is
depicted in the forms

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:10%
of an emperor, a
warrior, an explorer,

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:10%
or a soldier of fortune.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, Aries people tend to
be explorers whose curiosity

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and initiative are always on the
forefront of human experience.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And Aries has the ability to
make things stable, and solid,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:84%
and secure for
themselves and others.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.370 align:middle line:84%
In the positive expression,
Aries is unique and inventive.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:84%
But in the negative, it can
be egocentric, aggressive,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.656 align:middle line:90%
and demanding.

00:20:53.656 --> 00:20:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, in astrology, Aries is
ruled by the planet Mars.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And it rules the first house
of self in the horoscope.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
Other key words associated
here are leadership,

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:12.160 align:middle line:84%
being a builder of things,
being a doer, being a pioneer.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, these strengths are the
balanced or the pure expression

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:90%
of the Emperor archetype.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
But when those expressions
become either too much or too

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:84%
little, they go into
distortions and imbalances,

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:84%
which create the weaknesses
and the shadow side.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:middle line:84%
So some of those
weaknesses and vises

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.180 align:middle line:84%
that we need to watch
out for with the Emperor

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:36.720 align:middle line:84%
are an abuse of power,
self-indulgence,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:84%
being ungrounded,
being disrespectful

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.540 align:middle line:84%
towards authority,
such as becoming angry

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.070 align:middle line:84%
when somebody disagrees with
us or challenges our authority.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And being a controlling
father-figure

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.480 align:middle line:84%
would also be a shadow aspect of
the Emperor, as is stubbornness

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.394 align:middle line:90%
and being unreceptive to others.

00:21:58.394 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we acknowledge
the shadow aspects

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and how they're showing
up in us, you know,

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.920 align:middle line:84%
which ones are
showing up in us, we

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:84%
tell ourselves the
truth about it.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:84%
That's when we can
start to go to work

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.360 align:middle line:84%
on these aspects in our life
and transform them to reveal

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.300 align:middle line:84%
the alchemy, to start
that alchemical process

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.330 align:middle line:84%
within this archetype
of our life.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:84%
As we bring the
shadow to light, some

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of the gifts that it reveals
are exercising mind over matter,

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.450 align:middle line:84%
building something
real and solid,

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.810 align:middle line:84%
being able to really give form
and structure to our life,

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:84%
being energetic,
imaginative, assertive,

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:40.770 align:middle line:84%
cultivating the life force
to strive and succeed,

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
having a clear-eyed
view of reality,

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:84%
and developing concrete
plans and ideas

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:84%
and knowing how to
make them happen,

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
also being outwardly
directed and goal-oriented,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.085 align:middle line:84%
and accepting
responsibility for actions.

00:22:55.085 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of the
other benefits gained

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is that the Emperor helps
us to really have a renewed

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.790 align:middle line:90%
sense of life and adventure.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.870 align:middle line:84%
He encourages us to have
devotion to the great work,

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to have greater
initiative in our life,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:90%
to access visions of the divine.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:84%
And we can also
work with it when

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.685 align:middle line:84%
we want to strengthen
our connection to others.

00:23:16.685 --> 00:23:19.275 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.275 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does the Emperor
show up in your life?

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, think of times when you've
either been or encountered

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:90%
the Emperor in your life.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.740 align:middle line:84%
As children, our
fathers generally

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
played the important role
of setting our relationship

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.350 align:middle line:90%
with power and authority.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Our father was our
emperor as children.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But as adults, we
might also play out

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:46.650 align:middle line:84%
this dynamic with our male
bosses or superiors at work.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, any time we own our
power and our authority,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and we're not giving
it away to others,

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.360 align:middle line:84%
that is the Emperor
in us shining through.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, being in a
position of leadership

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
often comes with
being criticized

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.340 align:middle line:90%
more harshly for our faults.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And it often means holding
other people's toes to the fire.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So the Emperor in us must
cultivate a strong sense

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.330 align:middle line:84%
of self and put
on a bit of armor

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.680 align:middle line:84%
so as not to be so affected
by the attacks from others.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.320 align:middle line:84%
The more you recognize
him in your life now,

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
the more that will
also connect you

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.550 align:middle line:84%
with one of your parallel
lives, where the Emperor

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:90%
is the dominant archetype.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:84%
So what might our parallel life
be like under the archetype

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:90%
of the Emperor?

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, in times past, an
actual Emperor or King

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
who is actively seeking
to expand his empire

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:84%
would have hit the
mark, for example,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:84%
someone like Alexander
the Great or King David.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.270 align:middle line:84%
But a more modern example would
be a leader of an organization.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We could think of a CEO
of a large corporation,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
or the general of an army,
or the head of a program

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.630 align:middle line:90%
or division.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Whatever his profession,
he is a pioneer, a builder,

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:90%
and a visionary.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Although he's
learned the hard way

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that it's important
to surround himself

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.060 align:middle line:84%
with people who are
as strong as he is,

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
especially the people
closest to him,

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.430 align:middle line:84%
such as his collaborators,
his partners,

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and his intimate relationships.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
He has a tendency to get
bored or impatient with people

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.630 align:middle line:84%
that he feels who are not up
to his standards of excellence.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And he might lose
respect for them.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
His biggest lessons have been
in recognizing the potential

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:84%
within everyone and finding
strategies to cultivate

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and empower them to
rise to their potential.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Throughout his life,
he's known many successes

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.480 align:middle line:90%
and built wealth.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.120 align:middle line:84%
He's risen to positions
of authority and respect.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And by working with the Emperor
and invoking his energies

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you too
can awaken your facilities

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
for leadership,
reason, and authority.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as
we explore further

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.090 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 Archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for exploring
the mysteries of Tarot

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
