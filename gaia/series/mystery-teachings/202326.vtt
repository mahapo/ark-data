00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings".

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
How do we create a life filled
with greater joy, meaning,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:10%
and purpose?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, these are
the final lessons

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.010 align:middle line:84%
we must learn before
reuniting with our true self.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:10%
And these are the lessons of
the next two archetypes, The Sun

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.010 align:middle line:10%
and Judgment, have to teach us.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.050 align:middle line:10%
As we continue our ascent
on the hero's journey,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620 align:middle line:10%
we're finally emerging
into the full light of day,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:10%
followed by a spiritual light.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.920 align:middle line:84%
These two archetypes are the
principles of regeneration

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:90%
and realization.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.750 align:middle line:84%
The sun is the
regeneration of our spirit,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
and it makes us feel
young and strong

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.850 align:middle line:84%
and joyful again, like we've
been given a new lease on life.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Judgment is a symbol of rebirth.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It brings deeper
spiritual realization,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and it leads to a
revolution in our lives.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
Now these are some of the
most exciting final steps

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:84%
on our journey to
self-actualization and mastery.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:10%
After our journey
through the night, which

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.230 align:middle line:10%
was ruled by the moon, we come
to a new day as the sun rises.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:10%
And this new day
dawns as we emerge

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:10%
into this light with increased
strength and self-awareness,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:10%
knowing ourselves more clear
about what we believe in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:10%
and what's real.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.210 align:middle line:84%
The sun reminds us that we
are in a joyful process,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
a flowering of our
true self, and this key

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
brings us to the
point where we can

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.310 align:middle line:84%
enjoy the simple and beautiful
things in life right now.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:84%
The sun gives us constant
support in our lives.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Even our thoughts are
powered by solar energy.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And the sun's message to
us is shine your light

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
without attachments
or expectations.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Unconditional love is
not looking for anything.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Now as we experience more
and more inner development,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.240 align:middle line:84%
we'll eventually come to
the great solar initiation.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
This happens when
we come to a point

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.590 align:middle line:84%
where we consciously see
the intelligence that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.990 align:middle line:84%
lives within everything,
and even energy itself.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Now the sun isn't
the ultimate source,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.950 align:middle line:84%
but it's the direct
and immediate source

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.400 align:middle line:84%
of enlightenment
in our lives here.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.180 align:middle line:84%
Key 19, the sun, sheds
light into the dark corners

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness,
bringing what

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.920 align:middle line:84%
was subconscious to
conscious, and helps

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.380 align:middle line:84%
us to become more aware
of our greater self.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Now alchemy is often called the
work of the sun and the moon,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.560 align:middle line:84%
which are our self-conscious
and our subconscious aspects.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.310 align:middle line:84%
We finally reached a happy
balance between these,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're now enjoying each
other and working in harmony.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a collaboration
between our intuition

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and the illumination
that's our birthright.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:84%
The moon, sun, and
judgment keys also

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.250 align:middle line:84%
bring us into the
distillation stage of alchemy.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:90%
So what does distillation mean?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
In alchemy, when we emerge
from the fermentation stage,

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
it means that everything that
remains within this composite

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%
itself is of its pure essence.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Anything that was
corruptible has

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
died by the end of the
fermentation stage.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
So in distillation, what we
do is we take what remains,

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.460 align:middle line:84%
and we're now going
to mix it into water.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And then in that
water, we're going

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to put it into a glass vessel
called the distillation

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:90%
apparatus, and we heat it.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:84%
As the water evaporates, it
goes into a more subtle gaseous

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.030 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And in that state, it is more
receptive to subtle influences,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
to energy, to
spiritual intention

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.360 align:middle line:90%
being infused into it.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So in the Emerald
Tablet, it says

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:84%
it ascends from Earth
to heaven, and then

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.670 align:middle line:90%
it again descends to Earth.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So as the water evaporates and
it comes into this gas state,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:90%
it ultimately cools.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:10%
And when it cools, it
also recondenses back

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:10%
into the water.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.140 align:middle line:10%
And so we go through many
cycles of this evaporation

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:10%
and recondensing, going above
and receiving the powers

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:10%
from the above, from
the spiritual realms,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.560 align:middle line:10%
and then embodying that,
bringing that back down

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.400 align:middle line:10%
into the physical so that it
can be embodied within us here

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:10%
in this life.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:10%
So distillation is
a process within us

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:10%
where we are raising
our consciousness up

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.430 align:middle line:10%
to these higher
states, receiving

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:10%
spiritual illumination and
awakening, and then bringing

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:10%
that back down into
our lives so that it

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:10%
can be embodied, manifested,
and applied in this world.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.550 align:middle line:10%
So here, between the moon, the
sun, and the judgment keys,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:10%
the moon represents
taking what came out

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.010 align:middle line:10%
of the ferment from
the previous stages,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.760 align:middle line:10%
especially out of the star.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:90%
And we mix it into the water.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:90%
So the moon is the water here.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Then the sun is the fire
that heats the water

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:90%
and causes it to evaporate.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the judgment key
represents that ascension

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.300 align:middle line:90%
from Earth to heaven.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the world
key will represent

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.590 align:middle line:84%
it being brought
into Earth again,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
where it all solidifies and
takes on a perfected form.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
The sun is ruled by number 19,
and 19 is a number of goodness.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.750 align:middle line:84%
It represents victory
over any disappointments,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
as well as general
success in life.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:10%
The one and the nine
form this number,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.060 align:middle line:10%
and thus it has a lot to do
with self-consciousness again,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:10%
which is represented by
number one, or the magician,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:10%
as well as our inner
guidance that's represented

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:10%
by number nine, or the hermit.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:10%
Now in addition, when we
add the one plus the nine,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:10%
we get 10, which relates
to the Wheel of Fortune.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.320 align:middle line:10%
Now the sun is the final
result or the outer expression

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.740 align:middle line:10%
of that twist of fate
that began at the wheel.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And the wheel even
looks like a sun,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
in a way, as it radiates
out its own cosmic energy.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
The wheel is the inner
essence of the sun.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But we can take it
even deeper than this

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:84%
because the one plus the
zero also adds up again

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.650 align:middle line:84%
to one, bringing us
back to the magician.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So the true core
essence of the sun

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.700 align:middle line:84%
is the directed will and
concentration of energy

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
that is performed by the
self-conscious magician.

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.230 align:middle line:10%
Now let's explore the imagery
and symbolism of the sun card.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.280 align:middle line:10%
The sun shines
prominently on this card,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.710 align:middle line:10%
and we also see a
child on a white horse

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:10%
below holding a large red flag.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:10%
Behind the child is a brick wall
with sunflowers standing tall.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The straight rays that
extend from the sun

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.750 align:middle line:84%
represent cosmic radiant
light, while the wavy rays

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.510 align:middle line:90%
represent vibration.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
The face of the sun
indicates that this

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
is a living, conscious
intelligence, very

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
similar to what we
saw in the moon.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a reminder that the
material forces of nature

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
are actually modes
of conscious energy.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.330 align:middle line:84%
There's also four
sunflowers, and these

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
represent the natural kingdoms
of mineral, vegetable, animal,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.630 align:middle line:84%
and human, as well
as the four elements.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Now normally sunflowers
turn towards the sun,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:84%
and they follow the sun
wherever it is in the sky.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.680 align:middle line:84%
But these sunflowers are
turned towards the child.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And this hints that
all of creation

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
turns towards humans for
its final development

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
as we apply our creative
abilities and our art to that.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Now the stone wall
behind the child

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
represents truth as
being partially revealed

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.700 align:middle line:84%
and partially obscured because
of the five physical senses.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
It shows us that
comprehension of truth

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.430 align:middle line:84%
is limited when we rely
only on sensory input

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.920 align:middle line:84%
or physical proof, like what we
see happens today with science.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.070 align:middle line:84%
The child represents
our renewed self that

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.710 align:middle line:90%
has returned to a state of joy.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And the feather in the
child's crown of flowers

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:84%
connects back to
that feather of Maat

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
from the Justice key, which
represents purity and truth.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.980 align:middle line:84%
This child is also
androgynous looking.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:10%
It's hard to tell whether
it's a boy or a girl,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:10%
and that's because the two
have been brought together

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.000 align:middle line:10%
into union.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.260 align:middle line:10%
The red flag that the child
holds is a victory banner,

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:10%
and the color red shows the
active masculine element

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:10%
associated with the sun.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.330 align:middle line:10%
The white horse that
the child rides on

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.280 align:middle line:10%
relates back to the
white horse that we

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:10%
saw in the Death key,
who, if you'll recall,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.740 align:middle line:10%
was actually our true self.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:01.620 align:middle line:84%
White is always a reference to
the divine self of pure light.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
What's the main message that the
sun is trying to teach us here?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:84%
This key depicts the teaching
that only as a child shall

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:90%
you enter the kingdom of heaven.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Here we've returned to
that childlike state of joy

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and wonder and purity
within our own soul,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.617 align:middle line:84%
and we experience life
as a heaven on Earth.

00:09:23.617 --> 00:09:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Now the archetypal
role that is played

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.670 align:middle line:84%
by this key on our
journey is what

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
we call the return to light
and the reconciliation.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
The key lesson or concept here
is regeneration and renewal.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:84%
This path literally stimulates
new sunshine or light

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.620 align:middle line:84%
to shine in our lives, and
it manifests conditions

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.600 align:middle line:84%
in our life that might
help us to realize

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
that we have a role to play
in the greater universe.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:10%
What are some other important
correspondences of the sun?

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, its esoteric
title or secret name

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:84%
is the Lord of the
Fire of the Worlds.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And the element here associated
with the sun is obviously fire.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:10%
The sun is what rules the
sign of Leo, which was

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:10%
related to the strength card.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:10%
The sun is also exalted in
Aries, which is the emperor.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.070 align:middle line:10%
It also rules the
fifth house, which

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:10%
relates to creativity
and enjoyment of life.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And our sun sign in
astrology, or where

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.100 align:middle line:84%
we find the sun in
our natal chart,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
tends to influence our dominant
personality characteristics

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
or what drives us
as an individual.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.070 align:middle line:84%
It represents the basic
nature of a person.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
The key attribute of the sun
is that it assists the ego

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
to transform into a powerful
and positive self-image.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:84%
And just like the sun is the
heart of our solar system,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:84%
within humans, the
sun is also associated

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.460 align:middle line:84%
with our heart, which is
constantly pumping life

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:90%
into us all the time.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Now some other qualities
associated with the sun

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
are that it supports
the ability to generate,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.840 align:middle line:84%
to motivate, and
to inspire others

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.590 align:middle line:84%
through things like teamwork
and collaborative efforts.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Its challenge, though,
is to place ourselves

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.330 align:middle line:84%
in partnerships that are
really energizing rather

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.950 align:middle line:90%
than draining.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:84%
The sun magnetizes to us
people, opportunities,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.700 align:middle line:84%
and situations that
can enhance and support

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:90%
our basic vital nature.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
The sun generally is
happy, vibrant, romantic,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:90%
and has a childlike enthusiasm.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient
Egyptian tradition,

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
the God Ra was
associated with the sun,

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and in the ancient Greek, this
became Apollo, who we also

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:90%
encountered in the Chariot key.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.610 align:middle line:84%
Ra was considered to
be the major deity

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and creator of the
ancient Egyptian pantheon.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.470 align:middle line:84%
The entire pantheon
were actually

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:90%
called the family of Ra.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite likely that
these beings were actually

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:84%
intergalactic travelers
who came to Earth

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to share knowledge and
illuminate our consciousness.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of the strengths and the
virtues that the sun helps

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
us to achieve and
awaken in our life

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
are a greater level of
joy in life, cheerfulness,

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.010 align:middle line:84%
illumination and inspiration,
power in healing,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.190 align:middle line:84%
and the balance of
reason with intuition.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
These are the pure and the
positive balanced expressions

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.360 align:middle line:90%
of the sun.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But there can also
be distortions

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:84%
of either too much of
this or too little,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:84%
which then leads to weaknesses
and the shadow aspects

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.580 align:middle line:90%
or vices of the sun.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.730 align:middle line:84%
So some of those things
to watch out for here

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:84%
would include being
egocentric, having

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:45.980 align:middle line:84%
a lack of self-confidence,
being idle, or being dishonest.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
How does the sun
show up in your life?

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:84%
Now as children, we all had an
innate innocence and curiosity,

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted to express
our creative nature

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:90%
in all aspects of life.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.920 align:middle line:84%
But even as adults,
recall any time

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:84%
when you felt regenerative by
a day of being out in the sun,

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
for example, and how it
renewed your life force.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:84%
The sun is also about our
ability to express our will

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and to create, so anytime
you've done anything creative

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:84%
at any age, this was the sun
shining on you and through you.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:10%
But some of its harder
lessons might have also come

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:10%
during different
periods of your life

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:10%
when you needed to remove
yourself from partnerships

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:10%
or teamwork efforts that you
found depleting, draining,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:10%
or un-inspirational.

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
The more you come to
recognize the sun in your life

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
here and now, the
more it will also

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.800 align:middle line:84%
connect you with
becoming conscious of one

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.120 align:middle line:84%
of your parallel lives where the
sun is the dominant archetype.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.100 align:middle line:84%
People born under the
archetype of the sun

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:84%
are highly creative
people, and they

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
seem to light up a room
whenever they enter.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.920 align:middle line:84%
They're full of life,
vibrancy, and positivity.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
They're natural generators,
motivators, and stimulators

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:90%
of people and situations.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, they're equally
good at working with people

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%
either one on one or in groups.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:11.240 align:middle line:84%
They thrive on that
synergy that happens

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
when two or more
people come together

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:90%
to create a greater whole.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:84%
They make great life coaches,
art teachers, event producers,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:84%
motivational speakers,
leaders of innovative teams,

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and really anything that
inspires them and offers them

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.850 align:middle line:84%
a good creative
outlet, but that also

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.270 align:middle line:84%
involves some form
of leadership.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:84%
By working with the sun
and invoking its energies

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:84%
into your life, you can
awaken your creativity and joy

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:38.980 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
The next to last step
on our hero's journey

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:90%
brings us to the Judgment key.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.540 align:middle line:10%
Here the Phoenix rises
again from its own ashes

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:10%
to be reborn and awaken
to full consciousness.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:84%
This represents the
rebirth and awakening

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.180 align:middle line:90%
of our new, enlightened self.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the child of
the regenerated self.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a path of
fire and everything

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:90%
that fire symbolizes and means.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.950 align:middle line:84%
It's activating forces
within our lives,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
both physically and
spiritually, here.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Fire can destroy and
create, from its ashes

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:84%
we can always rise
again like the Phoenix.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Now this path can also
be used to strengthen

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
our Kundalini, or that
internal spiritual fire,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:84%
and to free ourselves
from old ways of being.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.920 align:middle line:84%
This path generates greater
strength and courage

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and self-assertiveness
as we face the fire,

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.270 align:middle line:84%
and it reminds us to look at
the history that we've shared

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and to forgive ourselves
and others for the judgments

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.340 align:middle line:84%
that we've made
about what we are

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.840 align:middle line:90%
or aren't doing in our lives.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.970 align:middle line:84%
The Judgment key is
also sometimes called

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.860 align:middle line:84%
the Last Judgment, which
implies completion, decision,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:59.640 align:middle line:90%
or termination.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the final state of
personal consciousness

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
because with the next
key of the World,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
we're moving into a state
of cosmic consciousness

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
where our sense of
separation is eliminated.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:84%
The neurology that
rules the Judgment key

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.610 align:middle line:84%
is number 20, which represents
awakening, resurrection

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:84%
or rebirth, and it brings
about a new purpose in life.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:26.660 align:middle line:84%
This number carries with
it a psychic potential

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.650 align:middle line:84%
in the form of precognitive
dreams as well.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination
of two and zero,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and the two represents
subconscious,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:84%
whereas the zero is the
super consciousness.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So here the two are
merging together.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.300 align:middle line:10%
So this relates, then, to the
high priestess or subconscious,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:10%
and the fool, super conscious.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And when you add these two
numbers up, two plus zero

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
gives us two again, which
makes the high priestess

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
the inner essence
of the Judgment key.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Now recall that
the high priestess

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.840 align:middle line:84%
is the root or the
mother of matter,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.550 align:middle line:84%
the prima materia from which
all manifestation is birthed.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Now here in Key
20, we're walking

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.240 align:middle line:84%
through another gate of the
zero and having a rebirth.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Also, we've gone up an
octave from the numbers

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.140 align:middle line:84%
of the teens that were all
dealing with self-consciousness

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:84%
because they started
with the number one,

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and now we're moving
into the 20s, which

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.180 align:middle line:90%
is around subconsciousness.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
So we've come to this point
where the light shines directly

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
into subconscious, and
our subconscious becomes

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.840 align:middle line:84%
transparent to that light
as it shines through us.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.410 align:middle line:10%
Let's now explore some of
the imagery and symbolism

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:10%
of the Judgment key.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.950 align:middle line:10%
We see an angel that fills
the sky partially concealed

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.370 align:middle line:10%
by clouds, and he
blows through a trumpet

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:10%
that is embellished by a
flag with an equal arm cross

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:10%
upon it.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Down below we see floating
coffins upon a sea of water,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and there are men,
women, and children

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
with their arms extended
out, looking up to the angel.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Now the bodies of these
people are tinted gray,

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.250 align:middle line:84%
which indicates that the
pairs of opposites that we've

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.610 align:middle line:84%
explored before have now
been blended together

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.200 align:middle line:90%
and neutralized.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So this gray also indicates
that the scene that's

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
being depicted here is
not actually located

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.150 align:middle line:84%
in the physical plane,
but it's related more

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:84%
to a spiritual
plane or to wisdom.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.770 align:middle line:10%
The angel here represents
the divine breath

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:33.320 align:middle line:10%
or the cosmic fire.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And this angel is
also attributed

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:90%
to Archangel Gabriel.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:84%
That's not only
because he carries

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:84%
the trumpets of annunciation,
but because Gabriel

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
is the angel associated
with the element of water,

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and here we see that the
angel's robe is blue.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:84%
Now the action of heat, or
that cosmic fire upon water,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
creates air, which is the
substance of the breath.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And the breath is expressed
and focused as we make sounds.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And sound is based on
a seven-fold scale.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.730 align:middle line:84%
These seven basic notes
or tones on the scale

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:15.460 align:middle line:84%
are indicated here
by seven lines that

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:90%
radiate out from the trumpet.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
And this trumpet
is an instrument

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:26.410 align:middle line:84%
utilizing sound and vibration to
send out its light and energy.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.870 align:middle line:10%
The sound is the instrument,
therefore, of final liberation,

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:34.030 align:middle line:10%
and the seven notes
or tones also affect

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.450 align:middle line:10%
our seven interior
stars or chakras

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:10%
through what we call sympathetic
vibration or entrainment.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:45.460 align:middle line:10%
The banner on the trumpet
has an equal arm cross on it,

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.930 align:middle line:10%
and this is the
same cross that we

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.320 align:middle line:10%
see on the chest of
the high priestess.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:10%
And now it's appearing here
on the banner of salvation.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Now as we look at
the coffins, why

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.490 align:middle line:84%
are these people rising
up out of coffins?

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So these coffins here,
though, are rectangular,

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and that represents our
three-dimensional way

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle line:90%
of looking at reality.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.520 align:middle line:90%
It's the physical plane.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It's limited.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:90%
We put things in boxes.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is an illusion.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And so these
three-dimensional coffins

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
are representing this limited
experience of 3D reality.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's also the cube of our
old personality, which

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.130 align:middle line:90%
we have now done away with.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And as the humans
are eternal spirit,

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.960 align:middle line:84%
their true self is starting
to rise up, showing us

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:90%
that we are not our body.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:90%
We're not even our personality.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:84%
We are the spirit, and we are
rising up to a new dimension.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.240 align:middle line:10%
So this is the gorgeous
butterfly, or the new self that

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.760 align:middle line:10%
is emerging from the chrysalis.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And these people are ascending
to a higher dimension

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.150 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, moving
out of 3D and into 4D,

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.300 align:middle line:90%
or even let's say 5D.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Now as we can see, there are
also many people, not just

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.150 align:middle line:84%
the first three in the
front, but there's also

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.820 align:middle line:84%
people in the rear or in
the distance of the ocean.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
So we can see that
there are many who

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:90%
are awakening and ascending.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So this key also
relates to a shift

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.970 align:middle line:84%
in the collective
consciousness and the ascension

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
of humanity to a higher realm
that we are destined to make.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But what else is judgment
trying to show us?

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, the archetypal role that
this key plays in our journey

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
is one of healing and awakening.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Its key lesson or concept
is spiritual realization,

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.110 align:middle line:84%
and it also shows us the power
that the awakened mind has

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.060 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to give
birth to new forms.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But let's take a moment here to
take a look at the last seven

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:90%
keys of the sequence.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:10%
They go from total
darkness at the devil

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle line:10%
to more and more
light as we progress.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.950 align:middle line:10%
We have the light in the tower
that comes from the lightning

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.250 align:middle line:10%
strike, that bolt from the blue,
although the tower is still

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.960 align:middle line:10%
pretty dark.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:10%
Then we have the light of
the stars in the Star key,

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.590 align:middle line:10%
which starts to guide
us and light our way.

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.990 align:middle line:10%
Then we have the
light of the full moon

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.060 align:middle line:10%
as things start to
become more apparent,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.040 align:middle line:10%
yet we're still in the dark.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:10%
And then we finally
come into the sun

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.810 align:middle line:10%
as it shines the full
light of day upon us

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:23.080 align:middle line:10%
and our consciousness
is really awakened.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.760 align:middle line:10%
And now with the
Judgment key, we

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.870 align:middle line:10%
have a spiritual light coming
from above that's blasted out

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.640 align:middle line:10%
by the archangel
and the rays that

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:10%
are coming out of his trumpet.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And finally, as we
move to the world,

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:39.650 align:middle line:84%
she is dancing in the cosmic
light of the universe.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So these keys are
progressively shining

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
more and more light
onto our subconscious

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and conscious mind.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So this key, then,
involves matters of choice.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a later stage of
the spiritual unfoldment

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.550 align:middle line:84%
in which our personal
consciousness is

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.990 align:middle line:84%
on the verge of blending
with universal consciousness.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Now this is also, then, a path
of karma, of cause and effect.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.160 align:middle line:10%
It releases energy that
stimulates situations

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:10%
in which we must face
responsibility, and also

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.010 align:middle line:10%
actively take on
our divine purpose

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.000 align:middle line:10%
rather than just ignoring
or postponing it.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.560 align:middle line:84%
It stimulates energies
that force and activate

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.870 align:middle line:84%
greater choice within
our mission in life,

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and it reveals what
unwanted ties we need to let

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.570 align:middle line:84%
go of in order to really
fulfill our mission.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Now at this point on the path,
we are also no longer bound

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.930 align:middle line:84%
by conventional
3D ways of being.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We have awakened and
are rising to a higher

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:90%
multidimensional consciousness.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.330 align:middle line:84%
Here we live an
experience of life

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:84%
it is completely different
from the ordinary,

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and our consciousness
is expanded

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:84%
to include inner awareness
of the truth about ourselves.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:84%
This realization
of the true self

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.970 align:middle line:84%
liberates us from all
sense of restriction.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.330 align:middle line:84%
We find this relationship with
the one life of our true self

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.960 align:middle line:84%
to be more real than any
of the passing vibrations

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.230 align:middle line:90%
that we once called reality.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's go through some other
correspondences for Judgment.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:84%
The esoteric title
or the secret name

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
here is the spirit
of primal fire,

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.340 align:middle line:84%
which also indicates its
element, which is primal fire.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Now this fire is the source
of all fire and everything

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:90%
that fire symbolizes.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.000 align:middle line:84%
It's the activating
force within our lives,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.210 align:middle line:90%
both physically and spiritually.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Primal fire is what drives all
alchemy within the universe.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Now the astrological
correspondence given here

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.620 align:middle line:90%
sometimes is the planet Pluto.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Pluto co-rules Scorpio and
the eighth house of sex.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:84%
Now regardless of
Pluto's eccentricities,

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.360 align:middle line:90%
it's a very powerful planet.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And it has a tendency to destroy
outmoded concepts in order

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.350 align:middle line:90%
to build anew.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.250 align:middle line:84%
When Pluto makes an aspect
during any kind of a transit,

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.480 align:middle line:84%
no one is left untouched
by its influence.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Pluto is the Lord
of the underworld

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and is also the planet
of death and rebirth.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is
symbolized by the fact

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.490 align:middle line:84%
that half the time, this planet
is frozen and dead when it's

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
really far away from the sun.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
half of the time, it's

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.240 align:middle line:84%
thawed and alive as
it comes in closer.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Some other key words that
relate to the Judgment key

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
are realization, universal
consciousness, resurrection

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and rebirth, thinking
outside the box,

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
and having a
spiritual awakening.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.350 align:middle line:84%
Now these are the balanced or
pure expressions of judgment,

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.680 align:middle line:84%
but if they go into imbalances
of either being too much or too

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.800 align:middle line:84%
little, it falls into
weaknesses and shadow

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the judgment key.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So some of those things we
need to watch out for here

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.790 align:middle line:84%
are being overly
critical and judgmental,

00:25:55.790 --> 00:26:01.730 align:middle line:84%
obviously, resistance, fear of
consequences, irresponsibility,

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:90%
and inertia.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.860 align:middle line:84%
How does judgment
show up in our life?

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:14.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, anytime that you've
heard the call to a higher

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.710 align:middle line:84%
purpose in life and
actively pursued

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.080 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual evolution
so that you could really

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:84%
be ready to know and
fulfill your mission,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:90%
that's judgment coming through.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Also, if you look at your
life from a bird's eye view,

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and you review how certain
events in your past

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:84%
all led you, step by step,
to where you are now today,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.680 align:middle line:84%
that was judgment
helping you to awaken.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.830 align:middle line:10%
The more you recognize judgment
at play in your life now,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:10%
the more you will
also connect with one

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.570 align:middle line:10%
of your other parallel
lives where judgment

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.660 align:middle line:10%
is the dominant archetype.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
What might our parallel life
be like under the archetype

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.410 align:middle line:90%
of judgment?

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.760 align:middle line:84%
These are people who've
heard the call to service

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and a higher purpose in
life, and they actively

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.890 align:middle line:84%
take on that mission
of not only pursuing

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.320 align:middle line:84%
their own transformation,
but also helping

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:84%
blow the trumpet of
transformation for others

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.160 align:middle line:90%
to awaken as well.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.130 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:84%
They step onto this
path of actively serving

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to help humanity succeed at
making a collective shift

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:84%
in consciousness so that
we can all, together,

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.860 align:middle line:90%
create a new and better world.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
They're really good
communicators, as well as

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:90%
public speakers or authors.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.310 align:middle line:84%
They're able to share
their perceptions

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:31.980 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
well-received, heard,

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.320 align:middle line:90%
and understood by other people.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:84%
These folks use inspiration
rather than fear

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:40.840 align:middle line:84%
to motivate people
to take action.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.110 align:middle line:84%
They're creative and
dynamic, and others

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.350 align:middle line:84%
see them as perceptive and
insightful and intuitive.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're strong
leaders for helping

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to guide people into a
new paradigm way of life.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.240 align:middle line:10%
By working with judgment
and invoking its energies

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.550 align:middle line:10%
into your life,
you, too, can awaken

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.410 align:middle line:10%
your sense of life purpose.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.640 align:middle line:84%

of Tarot and how

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.460 align:middle line:84%
they can help us make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:90%
