this is "Mystery Teachings."

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Can we make sense of
our physical experience

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
and become players in
the symphony of life?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:84%
Can we gain insights into
the fundamental formulas

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:84%
of creation and grasp
the mind of God?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:10%
There are many challenges
we must face, however,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:10%
in our quest to discovering
such a worthy prize.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.780 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we discover
what those challenges are,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:10%
the progress that has been
made in overcoming them,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.795 align:middle line:10%
and why this search for unity
is so important to our lives.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:84%
The two main pillars
of modern physics

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
are quantum field
theory, which deals

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:84%
with microcosmic behaviors, and
general relativity, which deals

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:90%
with macrocosmic behaviors.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard the
four physical forces

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
of gravity, electromagnetism,
and the weak and strong

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.400 align:middle line:90%
nuclear forces.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Quantum mechanics
has successfully

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:84%
been able to unify three
of the four forces.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.770 align:middle line:90%
But it does not explain gravity.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
General relativity,
on the other hand,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
explains gravity, but from
a classical physics approach

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't incorporate
quantum phenomenon.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
The challenge
physicists encounter

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
is that these two approaches
become incompatible

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.650 align:middle line:84%
when dealing with very
small scales yet high mass,

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
such as would be
found in a black hole

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or at the singularity in the
first moment of the Big Bang.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Attempts to incorporate
gravity into the standard model

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics run
up against infinities

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.770 align:middle line:90%
and deep paradoxes.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
This has forced
physicists to come up

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:90%
with entirely new models.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
Why should we care what
happens in black holes

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:90%
or big-bang singularities?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.100 align:middle line:84%
How does this knowledge have
any relevance to our lives?

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:10%
Well, the reason is that
this search for unity

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:10%
is also the search for us to
know ourselves and our origin.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Where do we come from?

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
The more we can understand
our origins the more

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:90%
we can understand our true self.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Only then will we
know what it takes

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.390 align:middle line:90%
to tap into our full potential.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
The fact that
physicists have now

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
started moving beyond
ordinary notions of spacetime

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and material ways
of thinking in order

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to find their
theory of everything

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:84%
reveals that there is a deeper
underlying reality where

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
everything is an
unbroken wholeness.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.650 align:middle line:84%
A unity that is the source of
all phenomenon in our universe.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And to grasp this unity we need
to go through a paradigm shift

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
in our ways of thinking
and approaching issues.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
What kinds of paradigm
shifts are happening now?

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of
themes revealing themselves

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:84%
as we consider the
current leading

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.370 align:middle line:84%
models that attempt
to unite quantum

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:90%
physics and general relativity.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:84%
One of those recurring themes
is that spacetime, matter,

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and even energy are no
longer seen as fundamental,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.730 align:middle line:84%
but, rather, as
emergent properties out

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:90%
of some deeper reality.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.630 align:middle line:90%
What is meant by emergent?

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:84%
The best way to describe
it is to think of water.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Water is made of H2O molecules.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Those molecules in
and of themselves

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
do not have the
quality of being wet.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
They can be in the air
state as they evaporate,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.610 align:middle line:84%
they can also be in a frozen
and crystallized state,

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.650 align:middle line:90%
or they can even feel dry.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
The H2O molecules are
discrete and individualized,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:84%
yet the water appears to
be continuous, flowing,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.140 align:middle line:90%
and transparent.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
All of these
properties of water are

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:84%
emergent as a result of how
the H2O molecules interact

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.340 align:middle line:84%
with one another at
different temperatures.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
We often picture space and time
as the fundamental backdrops

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:84%
to the universe, while matter
and energy are its building

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:90%
blocks.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
But these new models are saying
that that is not the case.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they are
just properties

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.710 align:middle line:84%
that emerge as a result of
interactions taking place

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:84%
within a deeper reality, just
as water's properties emerge

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.790 align:middle line:84%
from the water molecules
and their interactions

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.680 align:middle line:90%
with each other.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:90%
What is this deeper reality?

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:90%
That is the question.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.950 align:middle line:84%
To grasp it, we have
to completely change

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:90%
our notions of what is real.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Space, time, energy,
and matter are only

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
experiential attributes of
the deeper underlying reality,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.250 align:middle line:84%
similar to how water,
ice, or moist air

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
are experiential attributes
of H2O molecules interacting.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
We can experience these
different emergent

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.300 align:middle line:84%
states of water, but
we can't directly

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:84%
experience a single H2O molecule
with our five physical senses.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:84%
We can, however, experience
it with our mind.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Due to the knowledge
gained from science

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.670 align:middle line:84%
with its observational
tools, we are now

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
more informed about how
to visualize and imagine

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:90%
a single molecule of water.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Equipped with this
knowledge, we can

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.650 align:middle line:84%
use our consciousness
to interact

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%
with its consciousness.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
We have proof of this from
the work of Dr. Masaru Emoto,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
who demonstrated the
impact of our thoughts,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and vibrational
state of being

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.150 align:middle line:90%
and what they have upon water.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, long
before science told us

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
about H2O molecules,
ancient shamans, alchemists,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and mystics did have ways of
communicating and interacting

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.200 align:middle line:90%
with invisible essences.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:84%
They thought of them as spirit
beings, such as elementals,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.720 align:middle line:84%
divas, and angels,
as the consciousness

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:90%
behind all materia.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
They might not have known
the specific shape of an H2O

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:84%
molecule, for example,
but they certainly

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
mastered the art of conscious
communication with the elements

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:90%
and how to harness their power.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
As science comes closer to
understanding the deeper

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.730 align:middle line:84%
reality, it can
similarly help us

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:84%
to connect with it through
our mind and consciousness.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
If we can use our consciousness
to properly communicate

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
with the deeper
reality, then we can

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:84%
begin to impact how
it manifests itself

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:90%
into our experiential realm.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.430 align:middle line:10%
Just like we're able
to influence the shapes

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:10%
and beauty of water crystals
with our vibrational essence,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:10%
science is one part of
it, art is the other.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Science informs
us, and art is how

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
we use that and express
or directly interact

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:90%
with consciousness.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysics is about
bringing together

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
both the art and
the science in order

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
to achieve true
mastery and awakening

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.555 align:middle line:90%
of our full potential.

00:07:03.555 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go back to the
other themes that show up

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:90%
in the newer physics models.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.990 align:middle line:90%
What more is there?

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Concepts such as
supersymmetry, superfluidity,

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.420 align:middle line:84%
higher dimensions, holographic
information, coherence,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and a geometric
nature to the universe

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.640 align:middle line:90%
are all being proposed.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
What do all of
these things mean?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
To explore that let's dive into
a few of the leading physics

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.770 align:middle line:90%
models for unifying physics.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
The first and most
popular models

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
are various string theories and
something called loop quantum

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.040 align:middle line:90%
gravity.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
We explore these
in other episodes,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.470 align:middle line:84%
but string theory
especially is very elegant

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and it lends itself
well to correlations

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.170 align:middle line:84%
with hermetic, alchemical,
and other ancient spiritual

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.600 align:middle line:84%
In essence, these models say
that the fundamental components

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.360 align:middle line:84%
of that deeper reality
are harmonically

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
vibrating strings, membranes,
or loops of braided spacetime.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But this deeper
reality can only be

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.760 align:middle line:84%
found at the smallest
microcosmic scale called

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.030 align:middle line:84%
the Planck scale,
which is very tiny.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:84%
This scale is far
too small for even

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
our most powerful detectors
and particle accelerators

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.600 align:middle line:90%
to access directly.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.170 align:middle line:84%
But string theory does
make several predictions

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:84%
beyond what the standard
model has already verified.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:84%
The main new predictions
include a host

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.080 align:middle line:84%
of new supersymmetric
particles, which

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.330 align:middle line:84%
could account for much
of the dark matter that

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:90%
fills the galaxies.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:84%
They also predict that there
are 10 spatial dimensions

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.190 align:middle line:84%
plus time, causing
us to consider

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:90%
our multi-dimensionality.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us that the
laws of string theory

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.380 align:middle line:84%
are equivalent to the
laws of harmony, which

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.780 align:middle line:84%
relate to music,
sacred geometry,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.394 align:middle line:84%
and what creates
beauty in our world.

00:08:54.394 --> 00:08:56.310 align:middle line:84%
These are some of the
things that I personally

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
love about string theory
and do hope that they

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:90%
will be verified one day.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:84%
String theory also plays a
role in the holographic model

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:90%
explored in other episodes.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It says the vibrations
of these strings

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:84%
create waves or ripples
in the quantum sea.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:84%
As those waves combine, they
create interference patterns

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:90%
that contain information.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.980 align:middle line:84%
This information is encoded
upon the surface of the quantum

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:84%
vacuum within the
zero point field.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:84%
It's the information
patterns that

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
govern the formation
of our universe

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.480 align:middle line:84%
as well as the types
of particles and forces

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:90%
that can be manifested.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
Some scientists have
delved even deeper

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.380 align:middle line:84%
into this analogy of
the quantum vacuum

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.050 align:middle line:90%
as being like a vast ocean.

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.810 align:middle line:84%
If particles are more
like waves traveling

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.900 align:middle line:84%
upon the surface of the
sea, and if spacetime

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
is analogous to a
liquid, then physicists

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
say it must be more like a
superfluid, one that does not

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:59.250 align:middle line:84%
impose any kind of friction,
limitation, or dampening

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:00.995 align:middle line:90%
of the movement of those waves.

00:10:00.995 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that the
essence of the quantum vacuum

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.560 align:middle line:84%
is not physical, at
least in the ways

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that we're usually
thinking of it.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Or we might also say that
spacetime does not actually

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.390 align:middle line:84%
impose any limitations when
we connect with that deeper

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.620 align:middle line:90%
reality.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.430 align:middle line:84%
The final scientific
approach to unifying physics

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.560 align:middle line:84%
that is really worth exploring
is one that is relatively new.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.350 align:middle line:10%
In 2013, physicists
from the Institute

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.240 align:middle line:10%
of Advanced Studies
in New Jersey

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:10%
published their findings of
a new mathematical object

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:10%
they call the amplituhedron.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:10%
In essence, it is a
multi-dimensional series

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:10%
of interconnected
polyhedra, and it

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:10%
looks like an intricate jewel
of higher dimensionality.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:84%
The simplest version of it
consists of four tetrahedra

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:90%
connected by their faces.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
This shape does not actually
exist in physical space.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it is a purely abstract
object that exists only

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.420 align:middle line:90%
in a mathematical space.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.770 align:middle line:84%
It allows scientists to
model particle interactions

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.490 align:middle line:90%
in a much simpler way.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And there is not just one
amplituhedron, but many,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:84%
each depending on
the various particles

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.180 align:middle line:84%
interacting and all
the different ways

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.740 align:middle line:90%
that they can interact.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
These dictate the
dimensionality and facets

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:90%
of that geometrical jewel.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:29.160 align:middle line:84%
What used to take thousands
of equations and Feynman

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.050 align:middle line:84%
diagrams can now be done in a
simple one-line formula that

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.640 align:middle line:84%
just calculates the volume
of the underlying geometry.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.360 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, it points to a geometrical
basis to the universe.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
This is what I personally
love about this approach.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.800 align:middle line:84%
In addition to its
paradigm-shifting perspective,

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:84%
it says that geometry
underlies everything.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Now this idea is not
new to those of us who

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:84%
study sacred geometry,
which dates back

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
far beyond the
Pythagorean mystery school

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:90%
and to ancient Egypt and beyond.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:84%
But what is great about this
is that science is again

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:84%
catching up with what ancient
metaphysical teachings have

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:90%
been saying for millennia.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Sacred geometry governs
the true building blocks

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:90%
and fabric of our universe.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.980 align:middle line:84%
This model is peering into
an entirely different world,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
one of pure number and
geometry rather than

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.030 align:middle line:84%
one based in spacetime
and quantum probabilities.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It threw those
assumptions out the window

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
and stepped into an
entirely different mindset.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons that
most attempts to find

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
a quantum gravity
have failed thus far

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.640 align:middle line:84%
is that they run into this
issue with two core assumptions

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
that physicists make
about our universe.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:84%
These are known as unitarity
and locality, and both of them

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.110 align:middle line:84%
are based on old
materialistic paradigms.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Unitarity means that all quantum
probabilities for a given

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.670 align:middle line:84%
set of particle
interactions must add to 1,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
similar to how we
add percentages

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.930 align:middle line:90%
until we get to 100%.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
But this assumption
breaks down when gravity

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:90%
gets involved at small scales.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:10%
Locality, on the
other hand, assumes

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.150 align:middle line:10%
that particles can only interact
through proximity in spacetime.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:22.650 align:middle line:10%
But we know from entanglement
that this is not entirely true,

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:26.700 align:middle line:10%
and, again, it breaks down for
quantum gravity situations.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.370 align:middle line:84%
The failure of these
assumptions suggests

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that physics needs to be
reformulated without either

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:90%
of those old principles.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what the
amplituhedron approach does.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
By doing so, it
suggests that there

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.790 align:middle line:84%
is a coherent geometrical
structure at the foundation

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:49.530 align:middle line:84%
of the universe, while spacetime
locality and unitary of quantum

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.860 align:middle line:84%
probabilities are emergent
phenomenon that are

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:90%
a consequence of the geometry.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
existence of spacetime

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.560 align:middle line:84%
and the particle interactions
that take place within it

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.320 align:middle line:90%
are a result of geometry.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:90%
Geometry of what?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:90%
What is it made of?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, the basic
idea is that it's

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.970 align:middle line:84%
made of something
like rays of light

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.505 align:middle line:84%
called twisters that exist in
a purely mathematical space.

00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And what this reminds me of are
the rays of creation discussed

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.250 align:middle line:84%
in other episodes that
come from the Ein Sof,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:84%
the infinite source prior
to our physical universe

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:84%
coming into being, meaning
they originate somewhere beyond

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
or transcendent to our
physical spacetime universe.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Could scientists finally be
tapping into the mathematics

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
that reveals the
secrets of the Old One,

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:90%
as Einstein would have put it?

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.400 align:middle line:90%
That remains to be seen.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe they're
getting closer,

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
but they are still
missing key components.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into that,
there is one final thing

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
on the amplituhedron
idea to explore.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
The physicists
working on this model

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
believe that they have
discovered a master

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.999 align:middle line:90%
amplituhedron.

00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:90%
Well what does that mean?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.620 align:middle line:90%
How is it any different?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:84%
It was mentioned
before that there

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
are many of these
geometric objects

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:12.030 align:middle line:84%
because there are many ways
in which particles interact.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Physicists now believe that
all those specific amplituhedra

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:84%
are simply facets on the surface
of a more all encompassing

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.770 align:middle line:90%
master structure.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:84%
This master structure would have
an infinite number of facets,

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:84%
kind of like how a circle has
an infinite number of sides,

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
only this structure is much
more multi-dimensional.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
The volume of this
master structure

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.230 align:middle line:84%
would then theoretically give us
the total probability amplitude

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
of all physical processes
allowed in the universe.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:84%
It would be like their
Philosopher's Stone.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It could explain why our
physical universe appears

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to exist, why we only experience
three dimensions of space,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.700 align:middle line:84%
why time appears to
only move forward,

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and why spacetime
appears at all,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.560 align:middle line:84%
and how the Big Bang
and cosmology arose out

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.810 align:middle line:90%
of pure geometry.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
If this model or another one
similar to it proves correct,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:84%
then it will confirm that
spacetime is illusory,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and it will lead to a
profound shift in paradigm.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.850 align:middle line:84%
This master geometric
structure would

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:84%
be of infinite dimensionality,
but that dimensionality is not

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:90%
in spacetime.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it is in an abstract
realm of pure numbers.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:84%
While all phenomenon, such as
spacetime, separate forces,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.250 align:middle line:84%
particle interactions, and
even our earthly lives,

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
are simply emergent properties
from a deeper infinite

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:90%
wholeness.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
The changes we experience
in this physical realm

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.250 align:middle line:84%
arise from the structure, the
different facets of that master

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.220 align:middle line:84%
geometry, as it
moves and rotates

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
in the quantum sea
of the multiverse.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.480 align:middle line:84%
But the object itself is
changeless and timeless.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:84%
I just love this because
it relates to the mystery

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:07.270 align:middle line:84%
teachings on how the
spiritual realms interact

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.250 align:middle line:90%
with our physical realm.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into that,
there is one caveat

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.890 align:middle line:84%
to say in regards to this
amplituhedron model, which

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
is that so far it is based
on a simplified supersymmetry

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.760 align:middle line:84%
model that doesn't actually
describe real physics.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So we haven't found a valid
theory of quantum gravity yet,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
but physicists think there could
be a related geometric object

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:90%
that will work.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what
geometry will be the key?

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Let's now explore some mystery
teachings on this topic.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Nikola Tesla, the great
inventor who is an initiate,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.120 align:middle line:84%
said, "if you want to find
the secrets of the universe,

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
think in terms of energy,
frequency, and vibration."

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.630 align:middle line:84%
He lived his life
applying things

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.560 align:middle line:84%
like numerology and sacred
geometry to all he did,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.190 align:middle line:84%
such as repeating
everything in sets of three.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:10%
He said, "if you only knew
the magnificence of the 3, 6,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.690 align:middle line:10%
and 9, then you would have
the keys to the universe."

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Why did Tesla make
claims like these?

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
What's so special about
frequency, vibration, numbers,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:90%
and sacred geometry?

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah works deeply
with these things

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
as the fundamental building
blocks of all creation.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:26.140 align:middle line:84%
The Sepher Yetzirah, the
Kabbalistic Book of Formation,

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:84%
opens with a secret
wisdom teaching

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
that says God, or a
divine creative source,

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
engraved his name by three
seraphim, numbers, letters,

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:90%
and sounds.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And the word seraphim
means mighty angel.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.000 align:middle line:84%
So right away we're being
taught that numbers, letters,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and sounds are angelic
or spiritual forces.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.550 align:middle line:10%
It then goes on to
describe these further.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:10%
It says 10 are the
ineffable sefirot,

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.200 align:middle line:10%
meaning the essence of
the numbers 1 through 10.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:10%
Then 22 are the
letters, which it calls

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:10%
the foundation of all things.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:10%
And these are grouped into
three mothers, seven doubles,

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.870 align:middle line:10%
and 12 simple letters.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:10%
All together, these 10
sefirot and 22 letters

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.570 align:middle line:10%
form what are called the 32
wonderful paths of wisdom.

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Now what are the
Kabbalists telling us?

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Right away, they are saying
how important numbers

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.080 align:middle line:84%
are as fundamental building
blocks of creation.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
The divine uses
numbers to create.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:30.790 align:middle line:90%
But hold on.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:90%
What is meant by numbers?

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.380 align:middle line:84%
The sefirot out are
not ordinary numbers

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:90%
in the dry mathematical sense.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Rather, each number represents
a frequency, or, we could say,

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:90%
a ray of creation.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.590 align:middle line:84%
These numbers are alive,
conscious, purpose-driven

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:50.020 align:middle line:84%
spiritual light,
or rays of creation

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.240 align:middle line:90%
that emanate from the source.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:10%
Each number contains volumes
worth of information within it,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:10%
and each one represents
an essential aspect

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.140 align:middle line:10%
of divine source.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.140 align:middle line:10%
The 10 sefirot,
the first 10 rays,

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:08.080 align:middle line:10%
are arranged in the
pattern of the tree of life

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:10%
in the order of the
lightning flash.

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:10%
But the divine building
blocks are not only numbers.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.060 align:middle line:10%
It's also letters.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:90%
What is meant by letters here?

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Kabbalah, every letter
has a corresponding number

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.470 align:middle line:90%
as its foundational essence.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
But the letters then
take things further.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:90%
The letters form patterns.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.780 align:middle line:84%
A number is like a pure
singular frequency,

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.690 align:middle line:84%
while a letter is a
pattern shaped out

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.300 align:middle line:90%
of a combination of frequencies.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps it's like how when two
waves of different frequencies

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.990 align:middle line:84%
combine they form an
interference pattern that

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.940 align:middle line:90%
shapes a letter.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So a letter is in essence a
pure geometric arrangement

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.420 align:middle line:90%
of energy.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Is this starting
to sound familiar?

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.360 align:middle line:84%
Could we compare each letter
to a specific amplituhedron?

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.210 align:middle line:84%
If we were to use this
analogy, let's then

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.930 align:middle line:90%
take it a bit further.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember how the physicists talk
about a master amplituhedron

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.300 align:middle line:84%
as being somewhat equivalent
to a circle, where all lesser

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.270 align:middle line:84%
amplituhedra sit on the surface
facets of that master geometry?

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, in a similar way,
the Sepher Yetzirah

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:10%
talks about how all 22
letters are arranged

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.380 align:middle line:10%
as if upon a sphere.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.140 align:middle line:10%
Each letter is then
combined or connected

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:10%
with all the other letters,
forming pairs of letters.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:10%
This produces what is called
the 231 gates of knowledge,

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.730 align:middle line:10%
or we could say information.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Although knowledge is really
a better word because it

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.550 align:middle line:90%
implies intelligence.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:84%
This master structure of the
231 gates can then be rotated.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.190 align:middle line:84%
When it is rotated
forward or clockwise

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.840 align:middle line:84%
it leads to good and
pleasurable things.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.070 align:middle line:84%
But when it is rotated
backwards or counterclockwise

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:84%
we are told that it leads
to evil and torment.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.830 align:middle line:84%
This reveals to us that
forward or clockwise

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:84%
is aligned with the
will to do good,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.960 align:middle line:84%
while backward or
counterclockwise is

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:90%
against that will.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:84%
One simple way to apply
this is to train ourselves

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:84%
to draw or write our
zeros and Os clockwise

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.340 align:middle line:84%
with the intent of aligning with
the forward flow or the will

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.240 align:middle line:90%
to do good.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
Try it out, and pay attention
to how you draw circles.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Another important
key to the letters

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.180 align:middle line:84%
is that they all represent
a transformational process.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:10%
When we look at the tree
of life each path or letter

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:10%
connects two spheres.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.590 align:middle line:10%
The spheres, or the numbers, are
considered as states of being,

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.360 align:middle line:10%
while the paths,
or the letters, are

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:10%
more like states of becoming.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.130 align:middle line:84%
They are a transformation from
one state of being to another.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So the letters could be akin
to the dynamics of interaction

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:84%
between particles, which are
more like states of being.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.920 align:middle line:84%
This would match up
again with the idea

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.390 align:middle line:84%
of the amplituhedron, which is
based on particle interactions.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason why so many
ancient mystery traditions put

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.130 align:middle line:84%
a lot of emphasis on
learning to read and write

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.190 align:middle line:84%
ancient languages and
magical alphabets.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Good examples of this are
ancient Hebrew, Sanskrit,

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.740 align:middle line:84%
and Japanese kanji,
all of which are

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:84%
said to be among the few
remaining ancient languages we

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.130 align:middle line:84%
still really understand
that were derived from what

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.280 align:middle line:84%
are called the fire letters,
or the original language

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:10%
As we can also see
by now, the formation

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.470 align:middle line:10%
of both the tree of
life and the 231 gates,

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.540 align:middle line:10%
which are based
upon the letters,

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:10%
give us a variety of
sacred geometries.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:48.070 align:middle line:10%
As the pure frequencies of the
numbers combine or intersect,

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.390 align:middle line:10%
it gives the letters.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:10%
And then, as these combine
again in various ways,

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.180 align:middle line:10%
it results in sacred geometries.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:10%
Within these master patterns we
can find all sacred geometries.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:10%
Just start connecting
the dots and we'll

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.480 align:middle line:10%
find all the
fundamental patterns

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:10%
our universe is built on.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And so the Sepher Yetzirah
says that from nothingness

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.220 align:middle line:84%
the source Ein Sof
made something.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.230 align:middle line:90%
From nothing comes something.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.850 align:middle line:84%
From the empty void is
made the material world,

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:24.210 align:middle line:84%
using these numbers,
letters, and sounds.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:90%
Let's explore sounds now.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:90%
How do they fit in?

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, sounds are vibration.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The inner essence
of a letter is based

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.440 align:middle line:90%
on numbers or frequencies.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.600 align:middle line:84%
But the outer
expression of letters

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.170 align:middle line:90%
produces sound or vibrations.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:84%
We know from the research of
Swiss scientist Dr. Hans Jenny

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and many others who followed
in his footsteps, when

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.490 align:middle line:84%
the right sounds are
exposed to certain materia,

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:54.570 align:middle line:84%
such as water, clay, or
sand, it shapes that materia

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:90%
into sacred geometric patterns.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:59.400 align:middle line:84%
He called this research
cymatics, or the study

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:90%
of wave phenomenon.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.990 align:middle line:84%
But what is meant
by the right sounds?

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means a
sound or vibration

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.780 align:middle line:84%
that is resonant with
that particular materia.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Vibrational resonance
is one of the principles

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:84%
that Nikola Tesla used in
his various inventions.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:20.070 align:middle line:84%
Resonance implies the
laws of harmony and music.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.190 align:middle line:10%
These laws have to
do with ratios or how

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:10%
one frequency relates
to another, whether they

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.470 align:middle line:10%
harmonize or not.

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:10%
For example, in the standard
musical scale of an octave,

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.400 align:middle line:10%
there are eighth notes.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.730 align:middle line:10%
Do, re, mi, fa,
so, la, ti, and do.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:10%
That next do, the eighth note,
is actually the first note

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:10%
on the next octave higher.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:10%
So the second do is a higher
harmonic of the first.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.500 align:middle line:84%
This is a one to eight
ratio, the first note

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and the eighth
note in an octave.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Although, in terms
of frequency, it is

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.890 align:middle line:90%
double the rate of vibration.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:84%
The other way we
can get harmony,

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:00.450 align:middle line:84%
besides going up an
octave, is to use

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:84%
what is called the
perfect fifth in music.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.600 align:middle line:84%
That is to take the
fifth note, the so chord,

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and combine it with the eighth.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.340 align:middle line:10%
This is a five to
eight ratio, which

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.700 align:middle line:10%
is what we call a golden ratio.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:10%
What is a golden ratio?

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.930 align:middle line:10%
It relates to the
Fibonacci sequence.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:22.320 align:middle line:10%
Starting with the basic
binary of 0 and 1,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.690 align:middle line:10%
and then all other
numbers in this sequence

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.650 align:middle line:10%
derive from adding the two
numbers that preceded it.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:10%
But what's most interesting
about this sequence is

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.400 align:middle line:10%
that when we take the ratio
of any two sequential numbers

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:10%
it begins to converge to what
is known as the phi ratio,

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:10%
or golden ratio, of
1.618 dot, dot, dot.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.590 align:middle line:10%
Notice that the 5 to 8 ratio
is in this Fibonacci sequence.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.550 align:middle line:10%
This golden ratio shows up
all over nature in the cosmos,

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.430 align:middle line:10%
from the way that plants
grow to the proportions

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:10%
of our own bodies to
the golden spirals

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.650 align:middle line:10%
we see in shells, flowers, pine
cones, ferns, even all the way

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.140 align:middle line:10%
up to spiral galaxies.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.320 align:middle line:84%
The beauty of it is that
the same ratios that

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:84%
govern the laws of
harmony and music

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
also govern the laws
of sacred geometry.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Returning to cymatics
for a moment,

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Hans Jenny mostly studied the
effects of pure frequencies

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.772 align:middle line:90%
on various materia.

00:27:23.772 --> 00:27:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But there were a
few studies he did

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.230 align:middle line:84%
that combined different
frequencies, such as

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.960 align:middle line:84%
might be associated with the
sounds of different letter

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.300 align:middle line:90%
combinations from Kabbalah.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Letters combine to form words.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.140 align:middle line:84%
In many spiritual traditions,
certain divine names or words

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.890 align:middle line:84%
of power are used as
mantras and chants.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.640 align:middle line:10%
For example, Kabbalah talks
about the various names of God,

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:10%
such as the yud-hey-vav-hey
or the Tetragrammaton,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.490 align:middle line:10%
as being more like
formulas for creation.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:00.030 align:middle line:84%
While in Sanskrit, ohm is said
to be the primordial sound

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.530 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:10%
Some have even claimed
that when ohm is properly

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.380 align:middle line:10%
intoned across a
plate of sand it

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:11.220 align:middle line:10%
will shape the sand into
what looks like a Sri Yantra.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.990 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But without a doubt,
the vibrational energy

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.530 align:middle line:84%
of sound moves and
organizes matter.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:23.760 align:middle line:84%
We can imagine that if either
spacetime or the quantum sea

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:84%
is a superfluid, then
vibration of divine names

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.650 align:middle line:84%
or words of power
shape that superfluid

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:35.760 align:middle line:84%
into sacred geometric patterns,
like we see in cymatics.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:90%


00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:84%
This is one way that the
higher rays of creation,

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.650 align:middle line:84%
such as numbers and letters,
can make the transition

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:84%
from the realm of pure spirit
into the realm of physicality.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.290 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.800 align:middle line:84%
The final missing key in physics
models that we've discussed

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.340 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness,
the spirit which

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.230 align:middle line:90%
resides in non-physical realms.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.390 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic
principle of mentalism

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:08.160 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness, or mind,
is primary must be included.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.950 align:middle line:84%
So long as scientists
remain rigidly opposed

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:14.220 align:middle line:84%
to bringing consciousness into
their grand unified theories,

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.330 align:middle line:84%
they will fail to find a
true theory of everything.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.210 align:middle line:84%
As Tesla said, "the
day science begins

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.820 align:middle line:84%
to study non-physical
phenomena, it

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.370 align:middle line:84%
will make more
progress in one decade

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:29.790 align:middle line:84%
than in all the previous
centuries of existence."

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:33.000 align:middle line:84%
The newer physics models
based on geometry and laws

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.550 align:middle line:84%
of vibrational harmony
start to approach

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
this, especially when these
are combined with Kabbalistic

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.730 align:middle line:90%
and other metaphysical wisdoms.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.930 align:middle line:84%
But how does all of this
apply to us and our lives?

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.700 align:middle line:84%
With these
understandings, we become

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.310 align:middle line:84%
empowered to use
our consciousness

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.910 align:middle line:84%
to properly communicate
with deeper reality.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:57.660 align:middle line:84%
By doing so, we can
impact how it manifests

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:90%
in our experiential realm.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:04.020 align:middle line:10%
We and everything around us
are made of numbers, letters,

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:06.600 align:middle line:10%
sounds, and sacred geometries.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.230 align:middle line:84%
As we learn the true
underlying meaning and essence

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of each of these building
blocks, as well as properly

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.210 align:middle line:84%
tune our instruments, which
is our body, mind, and soul,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:21.910 align:middle line:84%
we can then use
these tools, as well.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.060 align:middle line:84%
This is something
Kabbalah and other mystery

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.110 align:middle line:84%
teachings have developed deep
arts and sciences around.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:31.230 align:middle line:84%
We can learn to apply
them in magical ways

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:35.070 align:middle line:84%
to enter into a co-creative
relationship with the universe

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.570 align:middle line:90%
and source.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the big
keys to doing this

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:84%
correctly is by properly
tuning ourselves

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.060 align:middle line:84%
to the higher energies
of spirit consciousness.

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.910 align:middle line:10%
Kabbalah talks about
ascending and descending

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.140 align:middle line:10%
the tree of life.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.560 align:middle line:10%
From the physical world of
diversity that we are in,

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:10%
we strive to ascend back
to the unity with source.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.750 align:middle line:10%
Simultaneously, spirit
seeks to express itself

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.990 align:middle line:10%
into the world of matter
by descending the tree.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah also teaches that the
best way to align with source

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and feel that
connection in our lives

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.445 align:middle line:90%
is to live in the middle pillar.

00:31:13.445 --> 00:31:15.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does that mean?

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.600 align:middle line:84%
At the top of the
middle pillar is unity.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:84%
For us, this means being aware
that we are one with all.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.280 align:middle line:84%
The next step down
the middle pillar

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.620 align:middle line:84%
is about hidden
knowledge and revealing

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.280 align:middle line:84%
the connection between the
physical and spiritual realms.

00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.780 align:middle line:84%
The center is about expressing
and recognizing beauty

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:90%
in all things great and small.

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.760 align:middle line:10%
Then we come to the
foundation, which

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.740 align:middle line:10%
is about grasping how the
laws of the universe work.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.710 align:middle line:10%
And at the very practical level,
patterning our daily lives

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.980 align:middle line:10%
through what we
think, say, and do

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:10%
to be aligned and in
the flow with those laws

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.090 align:middle line:10%
of the universe.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.190 align:middle line:84%
Finally, at the bottom
of the middle pillar

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.160 align:middle line:84%
is the physical kingdom
in which we live, move,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and have our experience
of being embodied.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.180 align:middle line:84%
We are here so that
we can learn the art

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:84%
and science of manifesting our
full potential into this world.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:84%
We are eternal spirit beings
having a physical experience,

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:90%
not the other way around.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.610 align:middle line:84%
When we can truly
grasp this wisdom,

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that is when our entire paradigm
of how we live in this world

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.390 align:middle line:84%
will completely shift,
making life so much more

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.660 align:middle line:90%
fun and full of true joy.

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:90%
Why is all this important?

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.050 align:middle line:84%
The search for unity,
knowledge, beauty, foundation,

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.110 align:middle line:84%
and understanding life
in the physical world

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:48.240 align:middle line:84%
is the search of both physicists
and metaphysicists alike.

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:51.390 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to make sense
of this grand experience

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.970 align:middle line:90%
that we are all a part of.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:57.450 align:middle line:84%
It can bring us meaning
and clarity of purpose.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It can also help us
to learn to harness

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.570 align:middle line:84%
the potentials available
to us and hopefully

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:08.760 align:middle line:84%
use them to transform our lives
and our world into better ones.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.060 align:middle line:84%
As we do, our
transformation sends ripples

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
throughout the cosmos
because we are the cosmos.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.400 align:middle line:84%
We are entangled with every
part of this universe.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, our efforts
for growth and expansion

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:29.700 align:middle line:84%
do matter in ways far beyond
what most of us realize.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.570 align:middle line:84%
When we learn to become
players in the cosmic orchestra

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and pluck the
strings of creation

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to make beautiful
music, that is when

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.640 align:middle line:84%
we will earn our rightful place
