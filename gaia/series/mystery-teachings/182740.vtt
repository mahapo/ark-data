>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.860 align:middle line:10%
Is there a way to awaken our
greater potential, and what

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:10%
does that really mean?

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.080 align:middle line:10%
To find out, let's unfold both
the science and metaphysics

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.115 align:middle line:10%
of our human capacities.

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:31.996 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
We are incredible beings
with huge potential

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
that is largely untapped and
is just waiting to be awakened.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Current statistics from
science are fascinating.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Less than 5% of the
universe around us

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
is made of ordinary
matter that we can detect.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
The other 95% is made up of
mysterious substances called

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.080 align:middle line:90%
dark matter and dark energy.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.430 align:middle line:10%
But science doesn't
know what it is.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Then consider that of this
5%, we only directly perceive

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
a small portion of the
vibrational spectrum

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.720 align:middle line:90%
with our five physical senses.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.760 align:middle line:84%
On top of this,
psychologists speculate

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that, like an iceberg, the
amount that we are consciously

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.750 align:middle line:84%
aware of is just the
tip of the iceberg,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.630 align:middle line:84%
while the majority is processed
subconsciously or even

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we are only
using about 1% to 3%

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of our DNA to build the
proteins that conduct

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:90%
all of our bodies' needs.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Combining all this
together, at least somewhere

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
between 90% to 99%
room for growth

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.380 align:middle line:84%
in our awareness of who we are
and this universe we live in.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
What this means is we
are barely even accessing

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:84%
one snowflake on the tip of
the iceberg of our potential.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:84%
What if we can
bring greater levels

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
of awareness and consciousness
into this process?

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.570 align:middle line:84%
What if we can start to perceive
more of the true reality

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:90%
around us?

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.170 align:middle line:84%
What if we can start
tapping into more

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.400 align:middle line:90%
of our full potential?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what we could accomplish
if we started accessing even

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:84%
a fraction more of those
hidden resources within us.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.330 align:middle line:84%
We could turn on abilities,
such as enhanced immunity,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.710 align:middle line:84%
inner genius, extra sensory
perception, better memory,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:84%
remembering our true purpose
in life, having more energy,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
vitality, and longevity,
activating our superhuman

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.000 align:middle line:90%
abilities, and so much more.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Think of what's depicted
in movies like Lucy

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.510 align:middle line:84%
or Dr. Strange, X-Men
or Neo in the Matrix.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We actually do have
that kind of potential.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.530 align:middle line:84%
The question is-- can
we wake it up and bring

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:90%
it more fully onboard?

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is yes.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.780 align:middle line:84%
What is the essence that
makes all of this possible?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.460 align:middle line:84%
As we explored
through Season One,

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
quantum principles underlie
everything in our universe.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.220 align:middle line:90%
We live in a quantum universe.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:84%
From the smallest of
particles to the largest

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.620 align:middle line:84%
structures of intergalactic
space, we are quantum beings.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard the phrase
everything is energy.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:10%
Einstein's famous
equation e equals

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:10%
MC squared says that mass times
the speed of light squared

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:10%
is equal to energy.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:10%
But it's not just
mass that's energy.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts and
emotions are energy, too.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about
holding more light within,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:90%
what does that really mean?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.730 align:middle line:90%
Is it just a spiritual saying?

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Or is there a physical
component to it, as well?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysically,
it means we carry

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.210 align:middle line:84%
a higher or faster
vibration of energy

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.940 align:middle line:90%
in both our soul and body.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Spiritually, this requires that
we expand our consciousness

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Physically, we
also need to expand

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
at the level of our atomic
and energetic structures that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:90%
make up our body.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And by expansion,
we literally mean

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.820 align:middle line:84%
that we expand so
that we can contain

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:90%
more empty space within.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And this idea of empty
space is really important

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
activating our potential.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
With the right amount
of new light or energy,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.150 align:middle line:84%
our electrons can
make quantum leaps

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and excite to higher
energy states within us.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Our electrons actually
become more highly energized.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.560 align:middle line:84%
What's important here is
that when the electrons jump

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to a higher orbital,
that creates

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
more empty space between the
electrons and the nucleus.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But as we know, empty
space is not really empty.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It's teeming with infinite
possibility and virtual energy.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
zero point field,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:90%
but it's not actually zero.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:84%
On the contrary,
there is a vast amount

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:84%
of potential energy contained
within it at the quantum level.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:10%
Theoretical physicists Richard
Feynman and John Wheeler

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:10%
once calculated the zero
point energy radiation

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:10%
of the vacuum to be
an order of magnitude

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:10%
greater than nuclear energy.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Feynman was quoted
as saying, there

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is enough energy in a
single cubic meter of space

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to boil all of the
oceans of the world.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:90%
This is the essence of creation.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
In Season One of
Mystery Teachings,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
we explored this and how to
truly access the quantum space.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Now in Season Two, let's dive
into the practical applications

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and how to truly
awaken our potential.

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:90%
Where do we start this process?

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
To awaken our
potential more fully,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
we begin by making a shift in
our awareness and perception.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Expanding our awareness not
only within the physical

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:84%
and our ability to perceive
with our five senses,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
but also expanding within the
mental, emotional, and ethereal

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:90%
planes.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
As we do this, we
begin operating

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.350 align:middle line:84%
with more awareness of
our multi-dimensionality,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.250 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to influence
higher planes of causation.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.800 align:middle line:84%
This is a process
of self mastery,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
and it is about
expanding our awareness,

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:84%
raising our vibration,
and transforming

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
into the light body.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.250 align:middle line:84%
It's about reaching
a level where

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.610 align:middle line:84%
we can operate consciously
all the way down

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
to the atomic scale,
and it's about accessing

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
more of the infinite
possibilities within us.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Like a professional
athlete who is training

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to maximize performance, we
must approach self mastery

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.350 align:middle line:84%
with a similar commitment to
our daily practice and training.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
By doing the work daily
to expand our perceptions,

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
to train our brain for greater
awareness, harness our will,

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and to make the
lifestyle choices

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:90%
that support our full potential.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic principle
of cause and effect

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.240 align:middle line:90%
says every cause has its effect.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Every effect has its cause.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens
according to law.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Chance is but a name
for law not recognized.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.850 align:middle line:10%
There are many
planes of causation,

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:10%
but nothing escapes the law.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
True magic happens when we
begin to influence these higher

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:90%
planes of causation.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But in order to consciously
influence these higher planes,

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
we must reach higher
states of consciousness.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
This is something we
can do by learning

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.120 align:middle line:84%
to shift our brainwaves,
overcoming limited thinking

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
and achieving a
state of coherence

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:90%
with the quantum field.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
As we begin to master how
we perceive and process

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
information or
energy, such mastery

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
doesn't happen through
a single process.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:84%
We must take a
multi-dimensional approach.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:84%
Thankfully, we have many
tools, both modern and ancient,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
to support us in
making this shift.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Some of the tools
include meditation,

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
which we use to bring ourselves
into coherence with the zero

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:90%
point field.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Activating our DNA
codes, which helps

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
us to express more of our
potential in the physical body.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Exercises to expand both our
physical and spiritual senses

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:90%
and perceptions.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And these are just a few of
the many tools available to us

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to help us become aware of
our multi-dimensionality.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:10%
In the Western
mystical tradition,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:10%
we have many hermetic
and alchemical methods

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:10%
for how to tap into those
higher planes of causation.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, this comes
from understanding

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.200 align:middle line:84%
how to communicate using the
language of the universe,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.840 align:middle line:84%
including numbers, letters,
sounds, and sacred geometry.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:90%
How do we learn this language?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Like with any
language, we learn best

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
through immersing ourselves
into its culture, symbology,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
proper use, syntax
and daily practice.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.440 align:middle line:10%
Or we can return
again to the analogy

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.610 align:middle line:10%
of a professional athlete.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:10%
The pros train every day to
prepare themselves and sharpen

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.440 align:middle line:10%
their ability to perform.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.280 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
the physical body,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.760 align:middle line:84%
if we stop our
routine of exercise,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.160 align:middle line:90%
we can lose ground very quickly.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.200 align:middle line:84%
Muscles atrophy,
and then we have

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to work harder to regain
the ground that was lost.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to just
keep up the daily practice

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and momentum, and not
let stagnation set in.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:40.220 align:middle line:84%
The most successful pros make
training into a lifestyle,

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
rather than just doing
it in short spurts.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.230 align:middle line:84%
The same principles apply
to spiritual mastery.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
It requires daily practice,
using the right methods,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.050 align:middle line:84%
to condition our spiritual
muscles, increasing

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.020 align:middle line:90%
strength, power, and endurance.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:10%
This also helps us to
sustainably operate

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:10%
at the higher levels
of performance.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:10%
Dion Fortune, an initiate with
the Western Mystery School

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.640 align:middle line:10%
Tradition says, "When
we speak of the Path,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.620 align:middle line:10%
we mean much more than
a course of study.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.980 align:middle line:10%
The Path is a way of life.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.920 align:middle line:10%
And on it, the whole
being must cooperate

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:10%
if the heights are to be won."

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.505 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we
stop our daily practice?

00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing,
the energy doesn't

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.130 align:middle line:84%
flow as well in our life,
meaning we encounter more bumps

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
through our daily
activities, we might not

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
handle stressful situations
with as much equanimity.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Daily spiritual practices that
include rituals and energy

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.340 align:middle line:84%
exercises are great tools for
harnessing and strengthening

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.510 align:middle line:90%
our will.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Meditation primarily
helps to quiet the mind

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and expand consciousness.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Rituals, on the other
hand, are a more active way

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.930 align:middle line:84%
of directing the flow of energy
and applying our higher will.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And it is our will that directs
our mind which, in turn,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.490 align:middle line:90%
influences the quantum field.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.330 align:middle line:84%
If our will is undisciplined,
then our lower mind

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.390 align:middle line:84%
tends to run the show,
and that lower mind

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
can be a monkey mind when
it is not well trained.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.970 align:middle line:84%
In the Western Mystery
School tradition,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.310 align:middle line:84%
we have a daily
affirmation that we use

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.860 align:middle line:90%
to start our ritual practice.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:27.830 align:middle line:84%
We say, it is by will alone
that I set my mind in motion.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:84%
Just contemplating this one
affirmation on a regular basis

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
can reveal many secrets
to self mastery,

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of manifestation.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:90%
It is a very important key.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
Taking this even further, the
hermetic principle of vibration

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.620 align:middle line:90%
says, nothing rests.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything moves.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.680 align:middle line:10%
Everything vibrates.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:90%
This is true at all scales.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:84%
From the subatomic to the
cosmic, everything is moving.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.280 align:middle line:84%
When we think about how
this applies to our life,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
we see that we, too,
are always moving.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.730 align:middle line:84%
We are either moving
forwards or backwards.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.280 align:middle line:84%
We are progressing
or we're regressing.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.170 align:middle line:84%
We're either in
a flow or an ebb.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
If we stop our good
practices, as much

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
as we might like
to tell ourselves

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that we can maintain
where we're at

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and just pick up later
where we left off,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:90%
this is not what happens.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Instead, we lose ground.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.470 align:middle line:84%
But when we integrate the right
daily practices into our life,

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.990 align:middle line:90%
we gain and then maintain.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
This is true whether our
daily practice consists

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of meditation, qigong,
yoga, focused breathing,

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.690 align:middle line:90%
or various esoteric rituals.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:90%
They all help.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Daily practice with
a certain routine

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:84%
brings us to a certain
level, but then we

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.440 align:middle line:90%
might experience a plateau.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.480 align:middle line:84%
In order to make
the next leap, we

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.740 align:middle line:84%
have to challenge ourselves to
move outside the comfort zone,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to stretch and grow in new
ways while still maintaining

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.310 align:middle line:90%
what has been gained.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
It is key that we continue
to challenge ourselves

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to the next level of
our greater capacity

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
by staying humble and seeking
new knowledge so that we

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.460 align:middle line:90%
can continue our growth.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Along the path to
greater self mastery,

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
there are inevitably
obstacles we must also

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:90%
look out for and be mindful of.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.460 align:middle line:84%
These obstacles are places
where we can get stuck.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And as a hermetic
principle correspondent

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.670 align:middle line:90%
says, as above, so below.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Or as the outer, so the inner.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Even though the
obstacles may appear

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
to be from things outside of
us, they are almost always

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of
something inside us.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we wouldn't
let them get in our way.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:84%
What obstacles do
we need to watch out

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
for so that we can have more
accurate perception of reality?

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
These obstacles come from our
biases, our judgments, fears,

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:90%
and assumptions.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:84%
The things that are
within our subconscious

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.090 align:middle line:84%
mind that will distort
and cloud our perceptions.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:84%
We must face and
address these things

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
in order to have clarity
in our perception.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
This is crucial in the
path to self mastery.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.560 align:middle line:84%
We just established that only
5% of the universe around us

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:84%
is made of ordinary matter
that we can observe and detect.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Within this 5%, our
five physical senses

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.090 align:middle line:84%
are further limited to
perceiving a very narrow range

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:90%
of frequencies.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:10%
For example, the range
of electromagnetic energy

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.260 align:middle line:10%
that we can see falls within
the band of frequencies

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.080 align:middle line:10%
that we call the
visible light spectrum.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, there are ranges of
what we can hear, feel, taste,

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:90%
and touch.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But we know that the
full spectrum of energies

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.330 align:middle line:84%
is much broader than what our
five physical senses typically

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:90%
perceive.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.940 align:middle line:84%
We also have what we could
call our five spiritual senses.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:84%
This is our
perception of stimulus

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:84%
coming in through the
energy field of our soul,

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:84%
rather than the physical
field of our environment.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Yet the range of perception
of our five spiritual senses

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
also tends to be narrow
compared to the full spectrum

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.950 align:middle line:84%
of energies that
we are exposed to.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:84%
What we perceive and are aware
of through our ten senses,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
both physical and spiritual,
is a very narrow percentage

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:90%
of what affects us.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:84%
For example, people
talk about EMFs

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.950 align:middle line:84%
from Wi-Fi and
cellular networks.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.160 align:middle line:84%
We don't typically perceive EMFs
with our five physical senses,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.210 align:middle line:84%
yet we know they affect us
and we know they are there,

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and research has shown that
they do have a physical effect.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, through science, we've
been able to detect these ranges

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.000 align:middle line:90%
beyond our physical senses.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:84%
We can also observe animals
who have a sensitivity

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:84%
to perceiving ranges that
are different from humans.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But just because
we aren't aware,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.510 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean we
can't become aware.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
We can train our senses to
tune into a broader range.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
We can condition ourselves and
reprogram our nervous system.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.635 align:middle line:84%
Our senses are malleable
and can be adjusted.

00:16:16.635 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
One good case study of this
shows how blind people often

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
develop their other four
senses, such as hearing, touch,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and smell, to be incredibly more
sensitive than most people who

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.500 align:middle line:90%
can see with their eyes.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
These people have
enhanced brain development

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
due to their more
finely tuned senses,

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and this also has
the added benefit

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:84%
of enhancing other abilities,
like memory and language

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:90%
capacity.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.910 align:middle line:90%


00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
How much of our brain
do we actually use?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.660 align:middle line:84%
We often hear in popular
culture that we only

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
use 10% of our brain capacity,
but that is a misnomer.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
The truth is we use 100%
of our brain capacity,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
but most people are only
consciously aware of maybe 10%.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.180 align:middle line:84%
If we were to hypnotize
somebody after walking down

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.040 align:middle line:84%
a busy street, they could have
100% recall of the information

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.599 align:middle line:90%
they were exposed to.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:84%
They could even remember things
like license plate numbers,

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
price tags on items in the
store windows, conversations

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that other people were having
that they passed, and so on.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to ask
them what they remembered,

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.360 align:middle line:84%
without hypnosis
most of us would only

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
recall maybe 10%
of those details.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.440 align:middle line:84%
The areas of the brain we
tend to be more conscious of

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:84%
are in the cerebral cortex,
or the uppermost portion

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.920 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Our conscious decision
making process

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.070 align:middle line:84%
happens primarily in
the prefrontal cortex,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:84%
the front part of the brain that
rests just behind the forehead.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
However, the deeper
parts of the brain,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.650 align:middle line:84%
including the limbic
system and old brain,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:84%
are usually operating beneath
the surface of our awareness.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.660 align:middle line:84%
We like to think that we have
full control of our decisions

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:90%
and actions.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, the neural
firings of the brain

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.880 align:middle line:84%
usually start in the old brain
system deep within, and then

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
flow from the bottom
up and then forward.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, our old brain is more of
our habitual and instinctual

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:90%
patterning.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
It governs our basic
survival of the body.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.090 align:middle line:84%
When we're stressed, feeling
any kind of fear or pressure

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:84%
in some way, then the old
brain's survival instincts

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.160 align:middle line:90%
kick in.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.610 align:middle line:84%
This sends the signals up to
the higher parts of the brain,

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
triggering various emotional
responses in the limbic system

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
and then thoughts in the cortex.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Those thoughts and
emotion then lead

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
us to make a decision
to act in a way that

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:90%
will help us survive.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, our
higher brain capacities,

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:84%
such as executive decision
making and abstract planning,

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:08.620 align:middle line:84%
can get hijacked by our survival
instincts when we are stressed.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.650 align:middle line:84%
We call this survival mode, and
when someone's in this mode,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:16.980 align:middle line:84%
it is hard for them to see past
their immediate circumstances.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.220 align:middle line:84%
One of our goals in self mastery
is to gain control of ourselves

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.720 align:middle line:84%
so that our animal instincts
don't hijack our higher mind.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:10%
Fortunately, we can become
more conscious and in control

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.670 align:middle line:10%
by rewiring our brain.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.160 align:middle line:84%
To do this, we use
certain sensory inputs

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.440 align:middle line:84%
to more purposefully
and harmoniously

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:84%
stimulate the brain
to take advantage

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:90%
of its neuroplasticity.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.920 align:middle line:84%
We can retrain our patterns
at the very foundations

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:90%
of our brain.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.200 align:middle line:84%
Our old brain controls
things like heart rate, body

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:84%
temperature, breathing rate,
and as we become more aware

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of these operations, we not
only perceive the subtle changes

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
in our body functions
much more quickly,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
but we can more easily identify
what is stimulating the change.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.420 align:middle line:84%
We become much more
in tune with our body

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:84%
as an instrument of
perception, and we

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
identify the cause of a
stimulus much more readily,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
developing that uncanny
ability to sense something

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:90%
before it happens.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:84%
How does this awareness
play into our intuition?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, for sure, part of
what we call intuition

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.800 align:middle line:84%
or the sixth sense
is simply a matter

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:84%
of having more enhanced
physical sensory perception.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.230 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to it, as well.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
We also have our spiritual
senses of our energy body

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.880 align:middle line:84%
that can detect more subtle
energies and higher vibrations

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:90%
coming in from spirit.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
When we can combine a
heightened sense of ability

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.850 align:middle line:84%
to perceive more with our
five physical senses along

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.490 align:middle line:84%
with our five
spiritual senses, that

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:59.240 align:middle line:84%
is when we become truly
superhuman in our awareness

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:90%
of what is going on.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.870 align:middle line:84%
So what are our
spiritual senses?

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.480 align:middle line:84%
These include our
perception of energy fields,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
such as magnetic energy, etheric
energies, the four elements

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
of earth, water, air, and
fire, the energies of the aura

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:90%
and higher dimensional energies.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
An example is when the hairs
on the back of our neck or arms

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:24.080 align:middle line:90%
stand up.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.350 align:middle line:84%
We may be having an
intuitive pit, a perception

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:90%
of subtle energies.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
This phenomenon in the body
is governed by the old brain.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Many people don't pay attention
to this kind of thing,

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.520 align:middle line:84%
or maybe they
rationalize it away

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and they stay unaware of what
is stimulating this response.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But the more in tune
we become, the more

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:49.220 align:middle line:84%
we are aware of these sensations
as soon as they happen.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
We can then pay
attention to the signal

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
to identify what's going
on around us that might

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:90%
be triggering this response.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Could it be that we are
empathically picking up

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:90%
on someone else's field?

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Empaths often feel what
others are feeling.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But when we don't have full
awareness of our field,

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:84%
we often misinterpret
the stimulus

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and might mistake it as our own.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.430 align:middle line:84%
This is where empaths tend
to take on the emotions

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and energies of other people.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But with greater awareness and
self-knowledge, we can realize,

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.620 align:middle line:90%
this feeling isn't mine.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from someone else.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:33.770 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to take it on as
long as we know it's not ours.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we can use that
information as a gift,

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of how am I going to
interact with this person now?

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
This information can help us
navigate our relationships

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.680 align:middle line:90%
and better serve other people.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.950 align:middle line:84%
As an empath, rather than
shutting down or withdrawing,

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.230 align:middle line:84%
we can learn to use
this gift to serve

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.405 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
compassion and empathy.

00:22:56.405 --> 00:22:58.181 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:58.181 --> 00:23:04.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
When working with
our intuition, there

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:84%
is another major challenge
that we must overcome in order

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:84%
to perceive more accurately
with our spiritual senses,

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and that is the social
programming that most of us

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:84%
have experienced, which causes
us to doubt our own intuition.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
In the age of
rationalism, we've learned

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:84%
to doubt intuitive perceptions
coming from the right brain

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:90%
or deeper parts of us.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.020 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't make
sense to our left brain,

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
or rational thinking, we've
been programmed to dismiss it.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.180 align:middle line:84%
I've had experiences
with this personally.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.940 align:middle line:84%
In science, we are trained
to be very skeptical

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:90%
until something is proven.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Everything has to
make sense and fit

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:52.830 align:middle line:84%
within a logical,
rational framework.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.500 align:middle line:84%
But as I started to awaken
more of my potential

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
by activating my DNA,
and brain capacity,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and through my
spiritual practice,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I started becoming more and more
aware of my intuitive thoughts.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But I also realized
I was automatically

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:90%
dismissing many of them.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.980 align:middle line:84%
An intuitive flash
would come in,

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and then this other part of me
would say, well, that's silly.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Why would I do that?

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make
any sense, and I

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
would dismiss the
intuitive idea right away

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.650 align:middle line:90%
in favor of my logic.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.980 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I started
having a series of events

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.680 align:middle line:84%
within a short period
of time where I quickly

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
experienced and learned
the results of not

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:90%
listening to my intuition.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
There'd be moments where I'd
realize I should have listened.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever experienced
something similar to this?

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.530 align:middle line:84%
How do we remedy this
so that we can become

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.010 align:middle line:90%
more attuned to our intuition?

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It starts by paying attention
to those little thoughts that

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.230 align:middle line:90%
flash through our mind.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Then we must catch
ourselves in the act

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.250 align:middle line:84%
whenever we realize we're
dismissing something off hand.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Next, we backtrack
to what were we just

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.610 align:middle line:90%
thinking a moment before.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:90%
What was that thought?

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
Once we trace it
back, we can ask, hm.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Would it do any
harm to follow it?

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.460 align:middle line:84%
If there's no harm that could
be done, then give it a try

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and see what happens,
see what results.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
For me, as I test these
intuitive thoughts out,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.130 align:middle line:84%
they usually would
reveal themselves

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.960 align:middle line:84%
to be valid and produce
good fruits or results.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.800 align:middle line:84%
The more they're validated
by their results,

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:84%
the more we start
trusting our own intuition

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.250 align:middle line:90%
and quieting our doubting mind.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.940 align:middle line:10%
To do this, first we must
become aware of our thoughts.

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to be aware
of the script playing

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.260 align:middle line:90%
in the background.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
Once we're aware,
we can reprogram it.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
We can reprogram it to
trust our intuition.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
The right hemisphere
of the brain,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.030 align:middle line:84%
which is connected to
our deeper intuition

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and processes in a more
Gestalt or big picture way,

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.020 align:middle line:84%
can assess a given
situation much faster

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.910 align:middle line:90%
than our left hemisphere.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.250 align:middle line:84%
That's because the left
hemisphere focuses more

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.130 align:middle line:90%
on the details and minutia.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Plus our intuitive right brain
processing of the whole picture

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.220 align:middle line:84%
can size up a situation with 85%
accuracy within three seconds

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:90%
or less.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:25.910 align:middle line:84%
In science today, they
call this thin slicing

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and rapid cognition
rather than intuition,

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:90%
but they work together.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, in our left
brain dominated world,

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
our biases and judgments are
often filtering, distorting,

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:90%
or negating our intuition.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Intuition does not operate
with the kind of linear logic

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
that we tend to
be biased towards.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:48.950 align:middle line:84%
We might not be
able to explain it,

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.100 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
it's not correct.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Intuition and the right
hemisphere of the brain

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.950 align:middle line:84%
operate with a
non-linear logic, which

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.750 align:middle line:84%
can be much faster and accurate,
even if we can't say why

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:90%
until we get more details.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.070 align:middle line:84%
For example, the right
side of our brain

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
processes pictures, while
the left processes words.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.900 align:middle line:84%
We say, a picture is
worth a thousand words.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:84%
From a single image, we can
gather a depth of information

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.730 align:middle line:84%
very quickly, both consciously
and unconsciously, mentally

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and emotionally.

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:27.350 align:middle line:84%
This happens much faster
than when we receive it

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:29.660 align:middle line:84%
from a written
description that gets

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.690 align:middle line:84%
processed through our
linear left brain logic.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:84%
So we must learn to
listen to our intuition

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and then gain mastery.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.530 align:middle line:84%
By having more experience
under our belt,

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.370 align:middle line:84%
we come to recognize the
subtle feelings coming

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:47.390 align:middle line:84%
from the deeper parts of the
brain and nervous system.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Many great thinkers of our time
have emphasized the importance

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.900 align:middle line:84%
of intuition and nonlinear
qualities of right brain

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.040 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein once
said, "I believe

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.560 align:middle line:90%
in intuition and inspiration.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Imagination is more
important than knowledge.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.940 align:middle line:84%
For knowledge is limited,
whereas imagination embraces

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:11.540 align:middle line:84%
the entire world,
stimulating progress,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:90%
giving birth to evolution."

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's notion of
embracing the whole

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.730 align:middle line:84%
and stimulating progress and
evolution points to the quantum

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.500 align:middle line:90%
world view.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The view that recognizes
how all things are

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.990 align:middle line:90%
connected and interrelated.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.300 align:middle line:84%
This shift into the
quantum way of thinking

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:84%
leads us to truly
unlimited potential.

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Our consciousness has its
home in the multiverse,

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the infinite space
of the quantum realm.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Are we aware of this
limitless connection?

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.870 align:middle line:84%
Are we aware of
our infinite self?

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Believing in something and
being aware of something

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:84%
We might believe
or have a concept

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.350 align:middle line:84%
that we are connected
and infinite,

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:84%
but our full conscious
awareness of this truth

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.320 align:middle line:84%
is typically lacking
in people today.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Due to our limited
perceptions, we're

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:11.370 align:middle line:84%
barely even aware of
the universe around us.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Most people are usually only
aware of about the first nine

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:19.050 align:middle line:84%
feet of their energy field, let
alone the rest of the globe.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.330 align:middle line:84%
This means the potential
for us to expand

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
into a more active
awareness is huge.

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.790 align:middle line:84%
We are only tapping into
a small fraction of it,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:29.850 align:middle line:84%
but we are meant
to get to the point

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:84%
where we are aware of not only
our connection to each other,

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.790 align:middle line:84%
but to our galactic
connection, as well.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.150 align:middle line:84%
We could have heightened
awareness of our own body--

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:84%
our heart rate, the
activities in ourselves,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:90%
even the atoms of our body--

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
as well as awareness of
other people's energies.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.250 align:middle line:84%
We could perceive the
life force within plants

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and communicate
telepathically with animals

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and with each other.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We'd be able to perceive a
wider spectrum of energies.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:01.320 align:middle line:84%
If we can bring our awareness
to the atomic level,

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.540 align:middle line:84%
we can access atomic
consciousness.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.800 align:middle line:84%
What do we mean by
atomic consciousness?

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a level
of attainment where

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:14.640 align:middle line:84%
we can control the atoms of
our body and our environment.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we would have the
ability to direct consciousness

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.510 align:middle line:90%
by will alone.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we begin to apply
all of this into our lives

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and truly awaken to
our greater potential?

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Throughout this season
of Mystery Teachings,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I share a variety of
practical exercises

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.970 align:middle line:84%
for putting these
concepts into action.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
By using them on
a daily basis, we

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:43.140 align:middle line:84%
can experience transformation,
expand our consciousness,

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.400 align:middle line:84%
and shift our awareness from
the microcosm to the macrocosm.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin with the
following visualization.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:59.130 align:middle line:84%
We start by taking a few deep
breaths and begin to relax.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:84%
As we breathe, we bring our
awareness to our solar plexus.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Think of the solar plexus as the
microcosm, and breathe into it.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Then, with the
exhale, feel and see

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.130 align:middle line:84%
the energy moving through
the entire nervous system.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.640 align:middle line:84%
The nervous system
is the macrocosm

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to the microcosm of
the solar plexus.

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:27.870 align:middle line:84%
Then we shift our attention
to the next level.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.020 align:middle line:84%
As we now inhale, imagine
the nervous system

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.300 align:middle line:90%
as the microcosm.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And with the
exhale, see and feel

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
the energy moving throughout
the whole physical body.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.420 align:middle line:84%
The physical body
is the macrocosm

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.940 align:middle line:84%
to the microcosm of
the nervous system.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Next, the physical body becomes
the microcosm as we breathe in,

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.720 align:middle line:84%
while the soul and mind
become the macrocosm

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.610 align:middle line:90%
as we breathe out.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:84%
We continue this pattern
of shifting from microcosm,

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to macrocosm, to
microcosm, and so on,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.160 align:middle line:84%
taking several
breaths for each level

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.230 align:middle line:90%
before shifting to the next.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Really feel it.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, inhale to the
soul as the microcosm,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and exhale to your divine
spirit as the macrocosm.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
Notice the difference between
the two states of awareness.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Notice the shift when we
consider macrocosm as the soul,

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.780 align:middle line:84%
compared to the
microcosm as the soul.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.260 align:middle line:84%
It isn't something to
understand in a logical way.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.520 align:middle line:84%
We must tune into the
flow and feeling of it,

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and how it is all connected.

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Next, inhale to the
spirit as the microcosm.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Exhale to the galaxy or the
cosmos as the macrocosm.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.650 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Inhale to the cosmos
as the microcosm.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:90%


00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Exhale to the logos or
spirit behind the cosmos

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.300 align:middle line:90%
as the macrocosm.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.970 align:middle line:90%


00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Inhale to the logos
as the microcosm.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.450 align:middle line:90%


00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
Exhale to the whole
universe as the macrocosm.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.510 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Inhale to the universe
as the microcosm.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Exhale to the multiverse
as the macrocosm.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.630 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:44.300 align:middle line:84%
Inhale to the multiverse
as the microcosm,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and exhale to the nervous
system of the multiverse

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.050 align:middle line:90%
as the macrocosm.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the breath
as we do this.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Breathing in, and breathing out.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:01.820 align:middle line:84%
As we breathe in, we are
drawing the microcosm into us.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:84%
As we breathe out, we are
expressing and flowing

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.250 align:middle line:84%
our microcosm into
the macrocosm.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.710 align:middle line:84%
Finally, notice the
connection between

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:17.929 align:middle line:84%
our own neurological system
and that of the multiverse.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.370 align:middle line:84%
The neurological system is
the multiverse within us.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The solar plexus is
our connection point,

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.060 align:middle line:90%
like the great central sun.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And it is through
the solar plexus

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.830 align:middle line:84%
that we can connect
to all our relations.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.949 align:middle line:84%
All these nerve
bundles coming into it,

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:41.730 align:middle line:84%
the whole neurological system
goes through the solar plexus.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is our main connection
point to the multiverse.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Flow this formula every day
through your soul, spirit,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.170 align:middle line:90%
and mind.

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.469 align:middle line:84%
Have it active within you
every day in your life.

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Our true potential
reaches everywhere,

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.070 align:middle line:84%
from this density all
the way back to source.

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.960 align:middle line:90%
It is an infinite spectrum.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
There is no limit to
how much we can awaken.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.430 align:middle line:84%
We must recognize that we
are not just physical beings.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Our limitless potential
comes from our spirit, not

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.600 align:middle line:90%
our physicality.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Our physicality is
but a reflection

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.300 align:middle line:90%
of our soul and spirit.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we dive even deeper

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:26.930 align:middle line:90%
into our infinite potential.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.640 align:middle line:84%
of our human potential with
me in this episode of "Mystery

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.440 align:middle line:90%
Teachings."
