>> The Major Arcana, or
the 22 keys of the Tarot,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.650 align:middle line:84%
is a picture book of wisdom that
depicts the journey of mystical

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.910 align:middle line:90%
ascension and transformation.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the process
of what we call

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.920 align:middle line:84%
mental alchemy or
spiritual alchemy,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is that we can learn to take
that energy from wherever

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:90%
it is right now and shift it.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.520 align:middle line:90%
Change its vibration.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Take it through the
transformational process.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And bring it to
the balance point.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And transform our
shadow into light.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Where does Tarot come from?

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.440 align:middle line:10%
The Tarot that we know of today
mostly traces its history back

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.120 align:middle line:10%
to renaissance Italy and France.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But the wisdom they
drew from had its roots

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient Egyptian
mystery schools of Toth,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.120 align:middle line:84%
the god of wisdom,
thousands of years earlier.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.060 align:middle line:10%
Desire and the
quest for knowledge

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.450 align:middle line:10%
are the two things that drive
the magician in his work.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.430 align:middle line:84%
He encourages us to
take action, rather

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.890 align:middle line:84%
than simply wishing
for change or success

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.240 align:middle line:90%
to just happen for us.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And he gives us the ability
to make our own reality.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:10%
The lovers represent our lessons
of choice in making decisions,

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:10%
especially as we learn
that the experience

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:10%
of our world of duality.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.250 align:middle line:10%
And by working with the lovers
and invoking its energies

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:10%
into your life, you, too,
can awaken the powers of love

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.530 align:middle line:10%
and discernment within you.
