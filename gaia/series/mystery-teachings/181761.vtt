00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings".

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.490 align:middle line:10%
Could our universe be
just one in a vast sea

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.260 align:middle line:10%
of the multiverse?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:10%
If so, how does it have
any bearing on our lives?

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we begin
to grasp our infinity

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.460 align:middle line:84%
and discover ways
to actualize more

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.190 align:middle line:90%
of our full human potential.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
Scientists and
science-fiction writers

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
alike love to toy with
the ideas of multiverses

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.180 align:middle line:90%
and parallel realities.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:10%
But usually when they
do, they invoke it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.830 align:middle line:10%
as a way to explain away the
anthropic principle, namely

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.870 align:middle line:10%
that our universe is fine tuned
for life, as if by design,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.500 align:middle line:10%
or alternatively to eliminate
the quantum interpretation

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:10%
of a participatory
universe, meaning

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.710 align:middle line:10%
that we have a role to play
in creating this universe.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
Often when we hear
scientists or media reporting

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
on mysterious topics,
especially ones

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that are gaining
a lot of attention

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
or that seem to be
paranormal, they

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640 align:middle line:84%
like to use this
phrase mystery solved.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Is it really, or
is that just a way

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
to get people to think
that there is no mystery?

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Science has solved it,
so we can stop wondering,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:84%
stop asking questions, stop
believing in higher powers

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
or aliens or whatever
mystery and just

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.690 align:middle line:90%
go back to life as usual.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we might want to all
be wary of this phrase "mystery

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.340 align:middle line:90%
solved".

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Life is one big mystery.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Our universe is an
even bigger one.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And the biggest
mystery of all is us.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.160 align:middle line:90%
What is our potential?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Exploring the mysteries
is what brings

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.560 align:middle line:84%
meaning and curiosity
and a desire

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.500 align:middle line:84%
to seek more knowledge so
that we can grow from it.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying to
explain away the mystery,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.020 align:middle line:90%
let's embrace it.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's welcome a bit more magic
and mystery into our lives.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
When we do, life becomes a lot
more exciting and interesting.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.840 align:middle line:84%
That is why this series is
called "Mystery Teachings",

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and that is also
why mystery schools

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:90%
are called mystery schools.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Rather than trying to
explain away the mystery

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:84%
or hide the mystery,
as some suspect,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
it's about exploring
the mysteries of life,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:84%
the universe, the soul,
the nature of spirit,

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:90%
and of the self.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Despite the way that
scientists interpret

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
this idea of a
multiverse, it too

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:90%
is a mystery worth exploring.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, because it helps us
to touch infinity and expand

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.350 align:middle line:84%
our mind, to remember who
we are as eternal beings.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysics also
works with the ideas

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.350 align:middle line:84%
of multiverses and parallel
realities while still

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:84%
including consciousness and
spirit as vital ingredients.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's explore what both
science and metaphysics have

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.430 align:middle line:84%
to say on these
ideas and how they

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
can be used in a way
that actually empowers

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:90%
our lives in the here and now.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.680 align:middle line:84%
We've learned that
string theory provides

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.190 align:middle line:84%
some exciting and beautiful
possibilities for discovering

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.610 align:middle line:84%
a unified theory of
everything, and string theory

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
is what has opened the door to
the multiverse idea in science.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:90%
How did it do that?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, it goes back to the
issue that string theorists are

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.810 align:middle line:84%
grappling with, the challenge of
identifying the exact geometry

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.390 align:middle line:84%
of the superstrings
and extra dimensions

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.370 align:middle line:90%
hidden within our universe.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
They have many
candidate shapes allowed

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.750 align:middle line:84%
by the math, over
10 to the power

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
500 possibilities, which
is a massive number,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.110 align:middle line:84%
each geometry
theoretically corresponding

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.220 align:middle line:84%
to its own universe with a
different set of physical laws

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.450 align:middle line:90%
and tuning.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But rather than saying there
can be only one right answer

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
resulting in only
one universe, namely

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
ours, string
theorists have instead

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:84%
proposed that all of
these possibilities

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
are equally probable and
likely exist somewhere

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.840 align:middle line:84%
within a multiverse, meaning
there are at least 10

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
to the power of 500
differently tuned

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.710 align:middle line:84%
universes out there in
the multiverse, maybe even

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:90%
infinite numbers.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:84%
But this part where they say
they're all equally probable

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
and all exist, this is the
part where some scientists then

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:84%
claim that this
means that there is

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.580 align:middle line:84%
nothing special about the
fine tuning of our universe.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:84%
We simply find these sets of
parameters in our universe

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because we can only
exist in a universe that

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.390 align:middle line:90%
is fine tuned for life.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
But there are many other types
of universes in the multiverse.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
We are just one possibility
in an infinite sea, nothing

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:90%
special.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, mystery
solved, or not.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:84%
Really, all of this
is speculation based

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:90%
on assumptions, not evidence.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.730 align:middle line:84%
How about we explore
another perspective?

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:84%
What does metaphysics
say about this?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer that,
let's first take a look

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:90%
at hermetic teachings.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.210 align:middle line:84%
In the hermetic teachings on
the principle of mentalism

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.680 align:middle line:90%
which says, "The all is mind.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:10%
The universe is
mental," it later

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:10%
goes on to say that "The
all creates universes

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:10%
in its own mentality,
and there are

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.710 align:middle line:10%
millions of millions of
such universes in existence

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:10%
within the infinite
mind of the all."

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:10%
There it is.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
Hermeticists have been talking
about the idea of a multiverse

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.900 align:middle line:90%
long before modern scientists.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But they can see
that this multiverse

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is within the infinite
mind of the all.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:84%
They then go on to say
that you are dwelling

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
in the infinite mind of the
all, and your possibilities

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and opportunities are infinite
both in time and space.

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we are
evolving within the all,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and there are infinite
possibilities and ways

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.920 align:middle line:84%
in which we can evolve in
our journey through eternity.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Rather than rob us of the
spirit or a divine source,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
the hermetic approach
to the multiverse

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
empowers us to realize
our infinite possibilities

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:90%
and eternal being.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Is that it, or is
there more to be

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:84%
gained from the
metaphysical perspective?

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
The mystery school
Kabbalah, we explore

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:84%
the concept of the
multiverse as well,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
and we use it to expand
our consciousness,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
to touch infinity.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.605 align:middle line:84%
For example, we explore
the Kabbalistic concept

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
of Ein Sof, the infinite
source that is without end.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof is that
source of will that

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
initiates the big bang of
creation of our universe.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:90%
How does Ein Sof do this?

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, Ein
Sof, being truly infinite,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:84%
is beyond our
universe, which means

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that Ein Sof's home is the
multiverse or the infinite sea

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:90%
of universes.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.370 align:middle line:84%
One version of the story
says that the infinite mind

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.390 align:middle line:84%
of Ein Sof devised a plan
to manifest a universe that

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
was conducive to
life, consciousness,

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
and its progression,
one in which

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
eternal spirits can
come into and inhabit,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
to express and thrive
in as living beings.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And to create this
universe, Ein Sof

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
summoned 144,000 rays
from the multiverse.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Each of these rays carry
different ingredients

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:84%
or aspects that could
fulfill parts of the plant.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof as a source
that creates universes

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
had already created
other universes

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.100 align:middle line:84%
within the multiverse,
but each universe

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:84%
has different components,
different laws, and tuning.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.520 align:middle line:84%
And to create this new
universe, Ein Sof needed

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.270 align:middle line:84%
a specific set of
ingredients or, we could say,

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:84%
information, or
even better would

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:84%
be to say a specific
set of blueprints

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that were needed to succeed
at fulfilling this plan.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Each ray holds a blueprint.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.210 align:middle line:84%
To get the right
blueprints that would work,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Ein Sof first sent out 144,000
feelers or messengers out

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:84%
into the multiverse,
and their mission

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:84%
was to scan, communicate,
and gain insight

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.820 align:middle line:84%
from amongst the trillions of
universes and possibilities

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:90%
to figure out what works.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.500 align:middle line:84%
As these messengers
went out all over,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
they then each
returned with one ray

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:90%
or blueprint that would work.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
As 144,000 rays with
the correct blueprints

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:84%
then came back together,
they collided into one point.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
That collision resulted in
what we now call the big bang.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.580 align:middle line:84%
That place where these
144,000 rays united

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.550 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the
great central sun which

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
is like one central mainframe
that holds all the blueprints.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
From there, the 144,000
are then sent out

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:84%
into the logos of the newly
created and expanding universe.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Each ray holds the blueprint
for a different density level.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.040 align:middle line:84%
There is a master
observing or overseeing

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
each ray with a host
of angelic beings

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.770 align:middle line:84%
to support them in now
carrying out the blueprints

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:90%
and manifesting the plan.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
It's a cool story, but
what does it reveal to us?

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah is saying that
there are 144,000 density

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.820 align:middle line:84%
levels on the
vibrational spectrum

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
between the great
central sun or origin

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and us here in the physical.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.660 align:middle line:84%
144,000 is regarded as a very
magical and sacred number

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:90%
in Kabbalah.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.900 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of
neurological reasons for why,

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:84%
but for now, let's
stay with this story

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.880 align:middle line:90%
and what else it reveals.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:84%
According to Kabbalah, this
physical density is the densest

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:90%
level, the 144,000th ray.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:84%
That obviously
then also tells us

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:84%
that within each
density level or ray

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:90%
there are sublevels as well.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
We know from science
that in the physical,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:84%
we have a full spectrum
of vibrational energies

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
that we can interact with
such as light, sound, materia.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.000 align:middle line:84%
All of this that we can
detect in the physical is part

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:84%
of the sublevels of the
144,000th ray or density level.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Remember that string
theory says there's

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.650 align:middle line:84%
just one string with a
particular geometry whose

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.640 align:middle line:84%
vibrations manifest all the
different particles, forces,

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
energies that make up the
physical universe we know.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah is saying
the same thing,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.560 align:middle line:84%
but it calls that string
a ray, and in particular,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.460 align:middle line:90%
it is the 144,000th ray.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:90%
What does this also imply then?

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, it says that our
universe is not just physical.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Within our universe, there
are 144,000 density levels

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.670 align:middle line:84%
with this physical level being
just one of them, the last one.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:12.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only are there many places
within our physical universe

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.600 align:middle line:84%
to explore and learn
from besides earth,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:84%
there are also many levels
beyond this physical density

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
to learn and grow from, and that
is just within this universe.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.610 align:middle line:84%
Beyond this universe, there
is an infinite multiverse

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:90%
to also explore.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So now why are we so
stuck on this idea

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.090 align:middle line:84%
that we can only learn and
grow in this physical density

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.320 align:middle line:90%
of earth?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
As the hermeticists say, our
possibilities and opportunities

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:90%
are infinite.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that
limits us is our mind.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Our mind, our concepts, our
thoughts create our reality,

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:84%
meaning the box we
put ourselves in.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.190 align:middle line:84%
By stretching our
mind and our concepts

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
out to touch
infinity and consider

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
all these other possibilities
and opportunities,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.530 align:middle line:84%
we can free ourselves from
limited thinking and limited

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.890 align:middle line:90%
ways of being.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
We can realize that this
life in this universe

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.990 align:middle line:84%
offers us a smorgasbord
of opportunity,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and that is the purpose
of this universe.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.240 align:middle line:90%
That was Ein Sof's plan.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:84%
That is why our universe
is so finely tuned for life

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.420 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness to
evolve and progress

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:84%
in it, even in ways beyond
what this physical realm can

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:90%
offer us.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
With this expanded awareness
of the possibilities that

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.340 align:middle line:84%
lie before us, we
can hopefully let

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:84%
go of getting so
caught up in the drama

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.890 align:middle line:90%
and minutia of the human game.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:84%
We can hopefully remember our
eternal being because we too

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:90%
came from the multiverse.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.850 align:middle line:84%
We are some of the spirits that
Ein Sof planned this universe

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:56.550 align:middle line:84%
for so that we could inhabit
it and express ourselves at all

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
the density levels, not
just the 144,000th level.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.420 align:middle line:90%
This level is the densest.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
As the light from source
flows down from the highest

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.110 align:middle line:84%
vibrational level to the
great central sun to us

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
here in this physical
density matrix,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.640 align:middle line:90%
its vibration gets slowed down.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.910 align:middle line:84%
It means that this
vibrational level of matter

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:84%
is the bottom speed of
light and is therefore

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
the furthest away from the
source that we can get.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:10%
That is why it is so
hard being physical,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:38.130 align:middle line:10%
and that is why this reality is
not the true reality because it

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:10%
is so filtered and distorted
by the low vibrations

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.200 align:middle line:10%
of this physicality.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.600 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, we are here

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.510 align:middle line:84%
to experience this
density, to learn

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.050 align:middle line:84%
to manifest at this
density and find joy

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.450 align:middle line:90%
in living here as well.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:59.550 align:middle line:84%
Realize too that our spirit has
already traveled and explored

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
through all the
higher density levels

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
while en route
from the multiverse

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
to the great central sun
out through the logos

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
across the cosmos, and
after eons of time,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.730 align:middle line:84%
we are now here exploring
this physical life on earth.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Our spirit has been on a cosmic
journey through eternity,

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and this physical life is
just our final pit stop

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.710 align:middle line:84%
before we begin
the journey home.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
This physical life
is but the blink

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.680 align:middle line:84%
of an eye compared to our
spirit's eternal life.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:84%
How's that for beginning
to grasp our infinity?

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
Some people may get
a bit overwhelmed

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:84%
with this idea of
how much more there

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:84%
is beyond this physical
life to learn and grow

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.560 align:middle line:84%
through, but usually when that
happens it's because we're

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.060 align:middle line:84%
projecting our pain, our fears,
and attachments from this life

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.020 align:middle line:90%
onto those other realms.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
But have no fear, it's
only up from here.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Once we transition out
of this physical density,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.920 align:middle line:84%
we then begin the journey
back towards higher vibrations

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.940 align:middle line:84%
of light, and things get
better, less veiled or filtered,

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.580 align:middle line:90%
more true to who we really are.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Now why do we come into
this density at all

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
if we have so many other
levels to learn and grow from?

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, in short, we're
here in training.

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:84%
We are here exploring
all these levels

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
in order to evolve and
transform into something more

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.520 align:middle line:90%
than just pure formless spirit.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:84%
We are here to
actualize our potential.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Mystery-school teachings
say that we are here

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:84%
to learn to become
creators so that we

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.510 align:middle line:84%
can contribute to this
grand symphony of creation.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And here at this physical
density of the 144,000th ray is

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:90%
where we learn to manifest.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
This density level
of the physical

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.690 align:middle line:84%
is where the pure
spirit potential can

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.120 align:middle line:90%
have its ultimate expression.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
To do so, we need to
learn how to harness

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:90%
the subrays of this density.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.280 align:middle line:84%
How do we do that and
where do we begin?

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.680 align:middle line:84%
We begin with ourselves
because we are the key.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.300 align:middle line:84%
All these rays and subrays
funnel down into us.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
They form our blueprints
encoded within our DNA.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.370 align:middle line:84%
They form every atom
and subatomic particle

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:84%
of our bodies because we are
the microcosm of the macrocosm.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Not only do we have all
the physical ingredients

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:84%
within our body, we also have
all the various energy levels

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
that connect us to the higher
rays such as our chakras,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
our aura, our etheric field,
our soul, our astral dimensions,

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.380 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.510 align:middle line:84%
All the powers of
the universe are

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
within us just waiting for
us to learn to tap into them.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.970 align:middle line:84%
So we start with
ourselves and just

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
being aware of the
graded potential that

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.890 align:middle line:90%
is available within us.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.790 align:middle line:84%
This is why above the doors
to the ancient mystery schools

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
were written the words
[NON-ENGLISH] or thine own self

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:90%
thou must know.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:90%
In other words, know thyself.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Then as we enter
through those doors,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
we gain greater access
to the deeper mysteries

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.609 align:middle line:84%
and learning tools and methods
for harnessing the keys

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.109 align:middle line:90%
within us.

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:25.220 align:middle line:90%
What tools and methods?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are many because
we are multidimensional,

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.660 align:middle line:84%
and different methods help
us access different levels

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.730 align:middle line:90%
and dimensions of our being.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is, of course,
an important tool,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:42.006 align:middle line:84%
as is the right use of toning
or chanting words of power.

00:17:42.006 --> 00:17:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Ancient mystery-school
traditions

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.730 align:middle line:84%
also hand down
rituals we can use

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.060 align:middle line:84%
to harness the rays of
creation and various

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
energy-body-activation
methods that empower

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
and awaken us to more of
our greater potential.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Building our chi or life-force
energy is also important.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:84%
Prayer is good for maintaining
an open and clear connection

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.510 align:middle line:84%
to spirit, and initiation
in an authentic lineage

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritual technology for
catalyzing and accelerating

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.670 align:middle line:90%
our progression.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Yet the place where we
must do the most work

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
is on our mind
and soul, not only

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.770 align:middle line:84%
by quieting the mind
through meditation

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.670 align:middle line:84%
but actually reprogramming it
to eliminate the subconscious

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.480 align:middle line:84%
backlog and all the limiting
beliefs and ego attachments

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.000 align:middle line:84%
from various indoctrination
or early traumas.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Now in saying this,
we're not just

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:84%
talking about reprogramming
through psychology or hypnosis

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.540 align:middle line:84%
or talk therapy or
other such techniques.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Those can be useful tools
in the right context

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and with the right
practitioner, but what

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.340 align:middle line:84%
we are talking about
here is alchemically

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.630 align:middle line:84%
transmuting the blockages and
raising vibration from ego

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:90%
to spirit.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
It is a process of
spiritual alchemy,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and alchemy is both
an art and a science,

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:84%
meaning there is a formula
to it, a step-by-step process

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:84%
and precise art that we learn to
harness so that we can speed up

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.965 align:middle line:90%
our progress.

00:19:10.965 --> 00:19:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And the best system
I know of for doing

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.360 align:middle line:84%
that at an accelerated
rate is a combination

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:84%
of ascending the tree of life
through universal Kabbalah

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and being on a
path of initiation

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.560 align:middle line:84%
in an authentic
mystery-school lineage.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.890 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kabbalah gives us this
map called the tree of life

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as a vast system of
awakening and understanding

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:38.490 align:middle line:84%
ourselves to repattern our
mind and soul using that map.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it is so powerful
is that the tree of life

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:84%
is the very structure
of our DNA blueprints,

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:51.300 align:middle line:84%
of how our mind works as well
as of the rays themselves.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.450 align:middle line:84%
When we work with
this geometry, we

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.560 align:middle line:84%
are in essence using the
multidimensional communication

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
system that directly
connects into our DNA

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:90%
and to the rays of creation.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
To get a sense of
this, let's dig

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in a bit deeper into the
mystery teachings of Kabbalah

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and take a look at how
the rays of Ein Sof

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:84%
are structured, remembering
also that these rays are

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.150 align:middle line:84%
similar to the concept
of superstrings.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
Could Kabbalah provide
further insight

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.730 align:middle line:84%
into string theory and
the geometry of strings?

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's find out.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.140 align:middle line:10%
Now the source of
these insights comes

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:10%
from an expert on metaphysics,
Kabbalah, and quantum reality,

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.220 align:middle line:10%
Frater Gudni Gudnason who is a
master initiate and key holder

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.049 align:middle line:10%
in the lineage of King Solomon.

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I really have to credit
him here because the most

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.090 align:middle line:84%
mind-blowing teachings I've
ever learned on my path

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.890 align:middle line:90%
have come through him.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Where do we start
in understanding

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:90%
the structure of the rays?

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:90%
At the top, of course.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
If we were to unfold a ray
and look down the primary axis

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.660 align:middle line:84%
from above, we would
see that each ray has

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:04.040 align:middle line:84%
five parts arranged kind of like
a medicine wheel or equal arm

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
cross with four quarters
surrounding the center, which

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.980 align:middle line:90%
is the fifth part.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:10%
What's fascinating
is that so many

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.110 align:middle line:10%
ancient spiritual
traditions around the world

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of symbol that
uses the same arrangement.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So all 144,000 rays
have these five parts,

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
which brings the total
to 720,000 subrays.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:84%
What Kabbalah reveals to
us is that this arrangement

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
is the axial view of the
three-dimensional tree of life.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:41.090 align:middle line:10%
The tree of life is thought
to be the master blueprint

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:10%
or DNA of everything from
the cosmos to our mind

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.380 align:middle line:10%
to our physical bodies
and biological DNA.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:10%
When we look at the tree
of life from the side view,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:10%
we see that not only
is each ray made

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:10%
of five parts or subrays, which
here become the five pillars.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.240 align:middle line:84%
We also see that each
of those five parts

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.580 align:middle line:90%
has several levels to them.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
On the two-dimensional
view of the tree,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.620 align:middle line:84%
there are 10 plus 1 spheres if
we count the hidden one called

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:90%
the [HEBREW].

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.850 align:middle line:10%
But on a three-dimensional
view, there are a total of 16

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:10%
plus 1 spheres,
including the [HEBREW]..

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
Then in addition to the
spheres are the paths

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.700 align:middle line:90%
that connect the spheres.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So we can begin
to see that there

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.310 align:middle line:90%
is an intricate structure here.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.370 align:middle line:84%
What if we considered
each sphere

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:84%
to be akin to the process
of space being braided up

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:84%
into a quantum loop, as is
proposed in loop quantum

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.310 align:middle line:84%
gravity while each path is
a string as seen in string

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:46.060 align:middle line:84%
theory, and around each of
those are wrapped the membranes

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.610 align:middle line:84%
from M-theory, akin
to how the myelin

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.980 align:middle line:90%
sheath wraps around our nerves?

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Then, similar to the way our DNA
twists into a helix structure

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.440 align:middle line:84%
and then is from there
curled and folded up

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
to form the
chromosomes, could we

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:84%
imagine this
foundational structure

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.820 align:middle line:84%
of the three-dimensional
tree of life

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
as the inner structure
of the rays from Ein Sof

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.540 align:middle line:84%
then curling and
folding in upon itself

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:84%
to form what scientists are
now calling superstrings

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
in hyperspace?

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And through all
of this structure

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.500 align:middle line:90%
flows information from source.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And as that information passes
through each part of each ray,

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.870 align:middle line:84%
it is set to vibrate and move
at different frequencies,

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
all governed by this geometric
structure and all together

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
creating a complex
symphony of creation.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:45.160 align:middle line:84%
This is then happening fractally
within every atom of our body,

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
within every cell
as our DNA, within

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:84%
our central nervous system as
the structures of our nerves

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and spine, within
our body as a whole

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.290 align:middle line:84%
and how our energy fields flow
and so on from the microcosm

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:90%
to the macrocosm.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And even though this
physical density

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
is created by just
the final ray,

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:10.810 align:middle line:84%
all the higher rays flow
down into this final density.

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.960 align:middle line:84%
This is why this physical
matrix is the best

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.730 align:middle line:84%
place to learn to harness all
the rays because they are all

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.590 align:middle line:84%
This is also why in Kabbalah
we say the kingdom of spirit

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.740 align:middle line:90%
can be embodied in the flesh.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So all these 720,000
subrays that flow into us

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.230 align:middle line:84%
are the integration points
that we have to work with here.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:90%
How do we work with them?

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, to begin working
with them is simple.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
It starts with just
being aware of them.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Just be aware that
there are 720,000 access

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:53.480 align:middle line:90%
points to infinity right here.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Next, we must move beyond
just awareness into action.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:90%
What kind of action?

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, any action is
good so long as we

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
are learning and
progressing from it,

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.150 align:middle line:84%
but there are certain kinds
of actions that will also

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:84%
help us access that
full potential faster,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
especially actions that bring
us into greater coherence, which

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:90%
we've mentioned before.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Now let's approach the same idea
from a new and more expanded

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.990 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
This approach relates to
our multidimensionality

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and coming into awareness
of parallel realities.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
What's meant by
parallel realities?

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
How are they different
from alternate universes

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.750 align:middle line:84%
within the multiverse
mentioned earlier?

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, to answer that, let's
return to some science

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
and then compare it
again with metaphysics.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.310 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics,
while scientists

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:49.000 align:middle line:84%
all agree on the experimental
results and findings, what they

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.760 align:middle line:84%
don't agree on is
the interpretation

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:84%
or more philosophical
implications of quantum theory.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.630 align:middle line:84%
For the last hundred years, the
most widely accepted approach

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to quantum mechanics was called
the Copenhagen interpretation

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:84%
of Niels Bohr, Werner
Heisenberg, and colleagues.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.190 align:middle line:84%
It says that of the many
possible realities that

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
could exist, only one actually
exists in the physical,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and that one is the one
we choose to observe.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it says that
observation creates reality

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.120 align:middle line:90%
by collapsing the waveform.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
This implies that the universe
is participatory and requires

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:84%
a conscious observer
at some point.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But in more recent
years, many physicists

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:35.870 align:middle line:84%
have started gravitating towards
alternate interpretations known

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.910 align:middle line:90%
as decoherence and many worlds.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.140 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary reasons for
this shift in interpretation

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
is that materialists don't like
the philosophical implications

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:49.700 align:middle line:84%
of the observer effect or
a participatory universe.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Because it opens the
door to consciousness

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:90%
and a spiritual source.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.860 align:middle line:84%
What approach then do the
many-worlds decoherence

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:90%
interpretations take?

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.720 align:middle line:90%
How are they different?

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Now decoherence says
that interactions

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.800 align:middle line:84%
from even the slightest
disturbance in the outer world

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.100 align:middle line:84%
environment can disrupt
the wave function

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and cause it to
decohere or split

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:90%
into two distinctive waves.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So rather than an observer
collapsing the wave function

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.950 align:middle line:84%
and forcing it to take
on one possibility,

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.520 align:middle line:84%
this says the environment,
such as interaction

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.730 align:middle line:84%
with a molecule of
air or a cosmic ray,

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:84%
is all that's needed to
collapse the wave function.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.920 align:middle line:84%
This interpretation
alone, however,

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.960 align:middle line:84%
does not account for all the
quantum phenomena we see.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Now the many-worlds
interpretation

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
then takes it further
and says that both or all

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.180 align:middle line:84%
possible realities
physically exist,

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:84%
but at each quantum
juncture a single reality

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:84%
splits into multiple
parallel realities,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:84%
meaning there is no
wave function collapse.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Instead, this gives rise
to a never-ending sequence

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.390 align:middle line:84%
of the physical universe
splitting itself

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.030 align:middle line:84%
into parallel realities
and therefore creating

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:90%
infinite parallel universes.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Now physicists claim that these
parallel realities are not

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.930 align:middle line:90%
imaginary.

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.900 align:middle line:84%
They are real,
concrete, and objective,

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and our parallel self in one
of these alternate parallel

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:26.610 align:middle line:84%
realities would equally argue
that theirs is the real thing.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:84%
What this is implying is that
either there is no choice,

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
or rather all choices
are made, each

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
in a different parallel
reality, and thus

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.960 align:middle line:84%
the concept of free
will is an illusion.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.750 align:middle line:84%
Even stranger is
that it says that all

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.600 align:middle line:84%
these parallel realities
coexist with us

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.770 align:middle line:90%
in the same space and time.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:84%
They're just existing on
slightly different frequency

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.600 align:middle line:84%
levels of energy, which is
just a thin membrane separating

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.800 align:middle line:84%
But scientists say that because
these parallel realities have

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
decohered, we can no
longer interact with them.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't see them
for a similar reason

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to why we don't hear all
radio stations being broadcast

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
at once because we're only tuned
in to one frequency station.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Has science fiction
become science fact?

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, although the verdict is
still out on this one because,

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:90%
again, it is all conjecture.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.260 align:middle line:10%
And as one of the grand daddies
of quantum physics, John

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.870 align:middle line:10%
Wheeler, has said about the
many-worlds and decoherence

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:10%
interpretations, it requires
too much excess baggage.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Even if it is true,
it still isn't

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.690 align:middle line:84%
sufficient to explain away
consciousness and spirit.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Metaphysics also works with
the idea of parallel realities

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.620 align:middle line:84%
while still including
consciousness

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:84%
and our participation
into the bigger picture.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:54.690 align:middle line:10%
And within such a framework,
there is a purpose to fulfill.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:84%
That purpose is to
first become aware

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and then to restore
coherence by our use of will

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness and
taking the right actions.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.120 align:middle line:84%
How does this work from the
metaphysical perspective then?

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, the science of
universal Kabbalah

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.900 align:middle line:84%
limits the number of
parallel realities

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.190 align:middle line:84%
we might be in based on the
pattern of the tree of life.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Rather than a potentially
infinite number,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.040 align:middle line:84%
as in the many-worlds
interpretation,

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah organizes them into 22
pathways on the tree of life.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.340 align:middle line:84%
These 22 pathways define
the archetypes of life

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.810 align:middle line:90%
or the ways of living life.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wished there could
be two or more versions of you

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.890 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish all you
want to do in life

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.920 align:middle line:84%
or that you could have
become somebody different?

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, Kabbalah says we have
22 distinct parallel realities

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.750 align:middle line:84%
or versions of ourself
in this physical world.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
They are 22 different
aspects of our total self,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
each one being very
different and living out

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:90%
its own physical life.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.590 align:middle line:84%
In each one of them, the
brain and the nervous system

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:09.590 align:middle line:84%
are programmed
differently, giving us

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:14.160 align:middle line:84%
22 unique perspectives
and experiences of life

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.450 align:middle line:90%
and how things are.

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:84%
All together, they
cover everything

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.520 align:middle line:84%
we need to learn in
this physical life.

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Now science often uses the
terms of parallel universe

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and parallel reality as
referring to the same thing.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.110 align:middle line:84%
It all exists as different
universes in the multiverse.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But in Kabbalah, these
terms are used differently.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Realities are the ones we
are consciously connected

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:90%
to and aware of.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So the question in
Kabbalah becomes

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.040 align:middle line:84%
how many of the
22 parallel worlds

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.550 align:middle line:84%
are we actually living
on a conscious level?

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Becoming conscious of all
22 aspects of the self

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.730 align:middle line:90%
is what we strive towards.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.700 align:middle line:90%
But how is that possible?

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.380 align:middle line:84%
To get a better
sense of this, we

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.020 align:middle line:84%
can use an analogy
of a cineplex.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:10%
Think of each life as being 1 of
22 different movies or perhaps

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.320 align:middle line:10%
holograms playing
in a grand cineplex.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.210 align:middle line:84%
From the perspective
of each life

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:17.740 align:middle line:84%
playing out in one
of the theaters,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.420 align:middle line:84%
there is only one script and
set of actors encountered.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And while our consciousness is
focused in on that one theater,

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.820 align:middle line:84%
then all we are aware of is
that one movie or reality.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:34.410 align:middle line:10%
But from the perspective
of our spirit or true self,

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:38.100 align:middle line:10%
it is in the center of the
cineplex or central viewing

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.640 align:middle line:10%
room that can see all 22
movies simultaneously.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.180 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to get our conscious
awareness to the center

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.590 align:middle line:84%
where our spirit resides
rather than having it dispersed

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.570 align:middle line:90%
through the 22 theaters.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.570 align:middle line:84%
This would equate with fully
realizing and awakening

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
to our spirit's
multidimensional existence.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:84%
When we consciously achieve
this oneness with our spirit,

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
then the 22 distinct movies
merge into one movie,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and we live all 22
archetypes of life

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.000 align:middle line:90%
in a single physical reality.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Another way of saying
this is that we

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:18.570 align:middle line:84%
bring our 22 parallel
realities back into coherence

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.020 align:middle line:90%
and reunite them.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, by becoming aware
of them, by awakening

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.830 align:middle line:90%
to our multidimensional being.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.990 align:middle line:84%
One tool we have for
this that gives us

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.350 align:middle line:84%
a window into each of
these 22 archetypal lives

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.710 align:middle line:84%
is the 22 major
arcana of the tarot.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:84%
When we study the 22
archetypes of the major arcana,

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.150 align:middle line:84%
not as a method of divination
but as a window into the self,

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:47.480 align:middle line:84%
we can become more
aware of those 22 lives

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.090 align:middle line:90%
our spirit is experiencing.

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:53.530 align:middle line:84%
We can ask, who would I
be in this archetypal life

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:54.800 align:middle line:90%
or that one?

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:90%
What would I be doing?

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
How my experiences and
perceptions be different

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.580 align:middle line:90%
in each life?

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.670 align:middle line:84%
We are connected to all of
them already through the higher

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.890 align:middle line:90%
consciousness of our spirit.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.409 align:middle line:84%
So first, we become
aware of them.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we start to merge
them into this life

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:84%
by putting on those
hats, so to speak,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and trying them
out in this life.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Be the fool.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Be the magician.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.850 align:middle line:90%
Be the high priestess.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:90%
Be the lovers.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Be strength.

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.969 align:middle line:90%
Be temperance.

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:90%
Be the world, and so on.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:28.460 align:middle line:84%
As we awaken all 22
archetypes in this life,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.699 align:middle line:84%
then the 22 movies
become one movie,

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:34.940 align:middle line:90%
one unified and full life.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.239 align:middle line:84%
Once we've merged
all 22, then what?

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:90%
Is that it?

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.730 align:middle line:84%
No, we are eternal beings
on an evolutionary journey.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.780 align:middle line:84%
After successfully completing
each step on our journey,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.830 align:middle line:84%
then we spiral up to the next
higher octave of our evolution.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Once we unify and
assimilate all 22 archetypes

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
of the physical life,
our reality then

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.030 align:middle line:84%
splits or decoheres
again, but this time it

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:06.600 align:middle line:84%
becomes 72 parallel aspects
of our soul's evolution.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So we move beyond the physical
into the levels of soul

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.980 align:middle line:84%
and continue
evolving by learning

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.820 align:middle line:84%
to integrate a new set
of expanded archetypes.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.060 align:middle line:84%
As we successfully merge those
72 archetypes of the soul

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.050 align:middle line:84%
into one whole, then
we spiral up again,

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and our parallel
realities now split

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.120 align:middle line:90%
into 144 archetypes of spirit.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Then we begin the evolution
of merging these into one

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:84%
and so on out into
our eternal being

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.180 align:middle line:90%
in the infinite multiverse.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.960 align:middle line:84%
By becoming aware of
our multidimensionality

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and the parallel realities
of our human potential,

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.060 align:middle line:84%
we begin to touch infinity and
find our way back to reuniting

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.070 align:middle line:90%
with our eternal being.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Our purpose through all of
this is to first become aware

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and then to restore
coherence by our use of will

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.610 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness and
taking the right actions.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.490 align:middle line:84%
With each cycle of our
evolutionary journey,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.760 align:middle line:84%
we learn to play more
musical compositions

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.190 align:middle line:84%
in the grand
symphony of creation.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We learn to use new
instruments and techniques.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.820 align:middle line:90%
We evolve, transform, and grow.

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:22.400 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully by
the time our spirit

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.970 align:middle line:10%
returns to the multiverse,
we have added some new notes

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:28.940 align:middle line:10%
to the symphony
of possibilities.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we
explore other forms of life

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.620 align:middle line:90%
in our universe and beyond.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.730 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:42.460 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with me in this
episode of "Mystery Teachings".

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.779 align:middle line:90%
