00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're going to meditate
on the archetype of the world.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
Now the world helps us
to become the conductor

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.650 align:middle line:10%
of our multi-dimensional
dance of life

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:10%
and to fully integrate
our true self.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.790 align:middle line:10%
This is where we can reach
true cosmic consciousness

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:10%
and self-mastery.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's explore some
practical applications

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that you can use to
awaken the world,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.090 align:middle line:84%
to merge your 22
archetypes into one,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:84%
and to integrate
with your true self.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Now to begin with, we must
complete our invocation

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.160 align:middle line:84%
of the 22 archetypes by working
with the world archetype first

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.220 align:middle line:90%
and awaken its power within us.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Here's a formula for invoking
the archetype of the world

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.620 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, find
the world card in your deck

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.340 align:middle line:90%
as we've been doing.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
meditation stool or cushion,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.800 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that and place
the card in front of you

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.970 align:middle line:84%
on a table, upright so
that you can see it.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.770 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:90%
Take several deep breaths.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:90%
Relax your body.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.526 align:middle line:84%
Begin to quiet down your
mind and settle your being.

00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And as you empty your mind,
make sure you bring yourself

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
to a positive or at least
a neutral state of being,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.968 align:middle line:84%
so that nothing is disturbing
you mentally or emotionally.

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.885 align:middle line:84%
Really come to that point
of stillness within.

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And when you feel
that, open your eyes.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.120 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
look at the image

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.910 align:middle line:84%
of the world for about 5 to 10
minutes with your eyes open.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Study its imagery
and its symbolism.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.630 align:middle line:90%
Take in all the details.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Really ingrain it
upon your mind.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Notice any subtleties you
might have missed before.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of each symbol

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.050 align:middle line:10%
and this card as a whole.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.560 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.380 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.873 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:42.873 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And then after those
first 5 to 10 minutes

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:84%
of looking at it
with your eyes open,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
it's now time to take it inside
and work with it in your mind

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.480 align:middle line:84%
for another 10 minutes
with your eyes closed.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So drawing this
image into your mind.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame
of the card is a doorway.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:10%
And on the other
side of that door,

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.030 align:middle line:10%
the scenery of the
world card takes shape.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.970 align:middle line:10%
Really build it up
within your mind.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:10%
Bring in all the
details, all the colors,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.960 align:middle line:10%
all the characters of this card.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.453 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:08.453 --> 00:12:51.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:10%
After those 10 minutes,
once this image

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:10%
is firmly established in your
mind, let it now come to life.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.590 align:middle line:10%
Move through that doorway
into the scenery of the card

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:10%
and let it take on a three
dimensional virtual reality

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:10%
experience for you.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.400 align:middle line:10%
Engage your active imagination
and work with all five senses

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.360 align:middle line:10%
to bring this card to life.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:10%
And sit there as the
observer for a while.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:10%
Notice what the beings
do in this card.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:10%
Notice if any of them
have any messages

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.895 align:middle line:10%
or certain ways of behaving.

00:13:25.895 --> 00:13:28.400 align:middle line:10%


00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:10%
Watch the cosmic dancer
and her dance of life

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.500 align:middle line:10%
and feel the energy
that the world emanates.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.890 align:middle line:10%
Let this energy really penetrate
and reverberate throughout you.

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:10%
Really connect to it deeply.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.110 align:middle line:10%


00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:10%
And then when you
feel that connection

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.850 align:middle line:10%
to the energy of the
world, the next step

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:10%
is to merge with the world.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:middle line:10%
Become the world.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.870 align:middle line:10%
See yourself as
this cosmic dancer.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:10%
Feel her come alive within you.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.640 align:middle line:10%


00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel this
energy integrating,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:10%
stand up and actually take
on the posture of the world.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.520 align:middle line:10%
Assume this archetypal
form and body position.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.500 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that you're holding
the two wands out to your side

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle line:10%
in an open position.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.120 align:middle line:10%
You're balancing
on your right leg,

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.550 align:middle line:10%
and you're crossing
your left behind it.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.280 align:middle line:10%
And you might even want
to dance and gracefully

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.420 align:middle line:10%
twirl around a bit as you
invoke the world dancer.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.810 align:middle line:10%
So spend just a little
bit of time doing this.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:47.570 align:middle line:10%
And when you really feel that
energy awakening inside of you,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:10%
you're going to use
this affirmation

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.160 align:middle line:10%
and state it out loud.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:57.160 align:middle line:10%
"I am the great one
of the night of time.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.560 align:middle line:10%
I am the universe.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:10%
I conduct the dance of life."

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Now once you've invoked the
world card into your being,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:84%
we're now going to
take this further.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.300 align:middle line:84%
You're now going
to sit and meditate

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes open on the
image of the 231 gates mandala.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And the focus point is the
very center of this mandala.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to set a timer
for exactly 21 minutes.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
meditate upon this mandala

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.180 align:middle line:84%
with your eyes open for
that full 21 minutes,

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:84%
concentrating all
of your attention

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:84%
on the center point, the Holy
of Holies, the coherence point.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, imagine
all the 22 archetypes

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
being drawn together into the
center and merging into one.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:29.380 align:middle line:10%
Once you've felt that
and accomplished that,

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:10%
then come to total
stillness within.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:10%
Be one in the center.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:10%
And then you're going
to use this mantra.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.980 align:middle line:10%
"I am one in the
center of being now.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:90%


00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.560 align:middle line:90%
The center of being now.

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.095 align:middle line:10%

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.810 align:middle line:90%
One center.

Be sure to take these
energies and express them

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.430 align:middle line:90%
into your outer life.

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.620 align:middle line:10%
Bring the primary
color for the world,

which is purple, into your
environment or your dress.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.790 align:middle line:10%
Keep meditating on these
symbols and images daily

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.000 align:middle line:10%
and work with these
affirmations that we just used.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.950 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate the
meaning of the world

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:36.200 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And watch for this archetype
to appear in your dreams,

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:43.490 align:middle line:10%
your synchronicities in life,
and analyze its messages.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:45.680 align:middle line:10%
Pay attention to how
you embody the strengths

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.200 align:middle line:10%
and the weaknesses of the
world and consciously work

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:10%
to make improvements
in these areas.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And remember, this is all
invoking and activating

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.750 align:middle line:84%
these archetypes in our lives
that set forces in motion.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.880 align:middle line:90%
So really pay attention.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And also remember that as
you work with the world,

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:84%
it's ultimately about
merging all 22 into one.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So continue working
with these practices

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.180 align:middle line:84%
until you bring all 22
archetypes into coherence

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.820 align:middle line:90%
and oneness within you.
