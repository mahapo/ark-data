00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.320 align:middle line:10%
Is there a way to harness
our quantum potential

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.440 align:middle line:10%
and truly direct the
course of reality?

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.920 align:middle line:10%
In this episode, we'll
unfold the core principles

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:10%
of the quantum world and
how they relate to us.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Many people are talking about
a shift in human evolution.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:90%
What is driving this shift?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And how do we steer it
in a positive direction?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Will it be primarily a spiritual
shift, as many in the new age

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:90%
believe?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Will it be a purely scientific
and technological shift,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.150 align:middle line:84%
as many transhumanists
and AI developers believe?

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Or will these two
approaches somehow

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:84%
meet and work together to
uplift the Earth to a more

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.250 align:middle line:90%
balanced and advanced future?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:84%
The answers to these questions
truly rests in our hands.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
One thing is for sure,
achieving such a balance will

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
require a core shift in how
we think, act, and relate.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
a paradigm shift.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Paradigm shifts are what
lead us to revolutionizing

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:90%
our way of life.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Kuhn, the author of
"The Structure of Scientific

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Revolutions," said that
"when paradigms change,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.070 align:middle line:90%
the world changes with them."

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Can we retrain our way
of thinking and living

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
away from old programming into
being truly open and attuned

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to a new paradigm of reality?

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:90%
We can.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the challenges
that we're encountering,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:84%
though, is that even in this
age of quantum physics, string

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
theories, and
multiverse cosmology,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.300 align:middle line:84%
human thought is still very
much stuck in a Newtonian way

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
of operating.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.170 align:middle line:84%
The way we perceive
and approach problems

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
has been heavily influenced
by outdated paradigms that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.650 align:middle line:84%
are no longer suitable for the
fast-paced and uncertain world

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:90%
of today.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:10%
In this regards,
Thomas Kuhn also said,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:10%
"All significant breakthroughs
are break-'withs' old ways

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:10%
of thinking."

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:10%
But also that we must replace
an old paradigm with a new one.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, a new vision for
how we relate to the world

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
is emerging and it is based on
the quantum view of reality.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a look at these
two paradigms, Newtonian

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.230 align:middle line:84%
versus quantum, and
how they differ.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
The Newtonian paradigm
is based upon the ideas

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of determinism, separatism,
reductionism, and materialism.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
In essence, this
says that everything

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:84%
can be isolated and reduced
to its individual parts, which

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.460 align:middle line:84%
must function in a linear,
logical, clockwork way.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
It says that things should be
predictable and controllable,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and it cuts us off
from spirit and choice,

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
and it encourages separation,
which fuels ego and greed.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to look far to
see how this old paradigm has

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.580 align:middle line:90%
led to a world out of balance.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:10%
What about the quantum paradigm?

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.440 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And can it help us
improve our situation?

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.940 align:middle line:84%
In a quantum view, things are
complimentary, contextual,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.130 align:middle line:90%
conscious, and connected.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
These quantum principles
turn the Newtonian paradigm

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.070 align:middle line:90%
completely on its head.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Now while strange and
exotic, quantum theory

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is the most successful physics
theory we have to date.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:90%
We live in a quantum universe.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
From the smallest of particles
to the largest structures

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.550 align:middle line:84%
of intergalactic space,
quantum principles

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
underlie everything
in our universe.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.400 align:middle line:90%
We, too, are quantum beings.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the most exciting
and promising aspects

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.840 align:middle line:84%
of quantum physics is that
it says that the universe is

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
participatory, meaning
our choices matter, even

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:90%
our thoughts matter.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:84%
This puts the power
back in our hands.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But there's more to this
process than the popular notion

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.360 align:middle line:90%
of intention.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:84%
As a scientist trained in both
classical and quantum physics,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
I have always been fascinated
by the strange and wonderful

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
possibilities of
quantum physics.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.680 align:middle line:84%
From the beginning
of my studies,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.880 align:middle line:84%
I had this intuitive sense
that quantum principles not

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.240 align:middle line:84%
only apply to the atomic
and subatomic worlds,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
but also to the basic
fabric of our existence.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.210 align:middle line:84%
They reveal a deeper
universal truth

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
about who and what we are.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
They can inform our
overall view of reality.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we reorient our ways
of thinking towards this view,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
the doors to new
possibilities open wide.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
what might happen

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
if we applied quantum principles
to re-envisioning our models

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
for 21st century society?

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
How might our societal
systems transform,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
systems such as business,
economics, relationships,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:84%
psychology, philosophy,
sociology, education, and more?

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.230 align:middle line:84%
When Newtonianism was applied
in this way over 300 years ago,

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
it not only cemented in the
scientific revolution that

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:84%
was underway, it also
became the catalyst

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
in the Age of Enlightenment
and then later, the Industrial

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Revolution.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
How might our way of
life transform today

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
if we truly reinvented ourselves
based upon the newer quantum

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:90%
principles?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
One example of how this has
already started to happen

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.640 align:middle line:90%
is through the digital age.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So many of our
modern technologies

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
that are driving society today
are based upon quantum physics,

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:84%
from cell phones to digital
computers, MRI imaging,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:90%
and atomic lasers.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, most
of us now recognize

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that we do live in
a connected world

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:84%
where energy and vibration are
more fundamental than matter,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and perspectives
are more relative

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.260 align:middle line:90%
or contextual than certain.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.730 align:middle line:84%
However, when it comes to
our day-to-day experience

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:84%
of the world around
us, most people

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
are still not operating
from quantum awareness.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.800 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's one thing
to have the concept,

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and it's quite another
thing to change

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:90%
the way we think and perceive.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Can we reprogram or
rewire our perceptions?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Is that even possible
after hundreds

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
of years of genetic and
social conditioning?

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.910 align:middle line:90%
The answer is yes.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It is possible.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.770 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a combination
of the correct concepts

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and daily practice
to make this shift.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
When enough of us make the
shift in our own lives,

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
then we can help support and
guide the collective shift.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's start diving in to take a
deeper look at the four quantum

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.860 align:middle line:84%
principles and
what they tell us.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
These govern all
quantum phenomenon

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.390 align:middle line:90%
and they're all interlinked.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Those principles, again, are
complementarity, contextuality,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, and connectivity.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:84%
What do these terms mean
and how do they apply to us?

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
To answer that, let's
take a look at each one.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:90%
First, is complementarity.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:84%
It is a cornerstone
principle that

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
governs many extraordinary
behaviors at the quantum level.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Central to it is what is known
as the uncertainty principle.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.510 align:middle line:84%
This says that it is
impossible to precisely measure

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.090 align:middle line:84%
two observables that
are tied together

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.130 align:middle line:90%
as complementary pairs.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:10%
One example of such
a complementary pair

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.620 align:middle line:10%
is a particle's position
in space and its momentum

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:10%
through space,
meaning if we know

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:10%
exactly where a
particle is, then

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:10%
we'll not be able
to know anything

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:10%
about its momentum,
which relates

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.570 align:middle line:10%
to its mass, its speed, and
its direction, or vice versa.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.400 align:middle line:84%
One interesting way to
apply this to ourselves

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
is to ask the questions,
where am I now?

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.475 align:middle line:90%
And where am I going?

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Now if we know
exactly where we are,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.610 align:middle line:84%
right now, then we
won't have total clarity

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:90%
on where we're going.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:10%
And that's because in order
to know our exact position,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:10%
we must be standing still.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
If we're standing still,
then we have several options

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:90%
for where we can go from here.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.570 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever experienced
that kind of uncertainty

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.774 align:middle line:90%
in where you're going in life?

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:84%
Now the flip side of
this is that if we

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
know our precise momentum
of where we're going

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and how fast, we'll not be able
to know exactly where we are.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
That's because we're moving and
so our position keeps changing.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Now it's good to have
momentum in life.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's also important to
sometimes stop and be here,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.255 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Now speaking of the now,
another complementary pair

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.175 align:middle line:90%
are energy and time.

00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Now how can we
understand this one?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.310 align:middle line:84%
First of all, energy is
related to vibration.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.930 align:middle line:84%
All things move, or
oscillate, at a certain rate.

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And the rate of
vibration is what

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
we call the frequency,
which is usually

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.460 align:middle line:90%
measured as cycles per second.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Now frequency and
therefore, energy,

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:90%
are inversely connected to time.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.090 align:middle line:84%
How energy and time are
coupled at the quantum level

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:90%
goes something like this--

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:84%
if we know the precise moment
that an event takes place, then

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:84%
that amount of energy contained
in it becomes uncertain,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.680 align:middle line:84%
meaning all energy is
potentially accessible.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, if we know exactly
how much energy something has,

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:84%
then we'll not be able
to say when it occurred,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.560 align:middle line:84%
meaning all time is
potentially accessible,

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.140 align:middle line:90%
giving us access to eternity.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Now how can we apply
this to ourselves?

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.680 align:middle line:84%
We can ask the
questions, when am I?

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Am I stuck in the past?

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Am I projecting into the future?

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:10%
When our mind is ruminating
on past or future,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.680 align:middle line:10%
we can sense how much
energy it takes up.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Or am I in the now?

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Only when we're in the
now does our measurement

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
of time become precise
because only the now is real.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Now the cool thing is that
when we're in the now,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
that is when limitless energy
becomes possible or accessible.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, we could ask,
what is my energy level?

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Since energy is directly
related to frequency,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
when we increase our frequency,
we raise our energy level.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
If we can bring our energy
into a coherent state

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.730 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
precisely attuned to one

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.690 align:middle line:84%
frequency or resonance, that
is when our sense of time

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:09.140 align:middle line:84%
disappears and we can
become one with eternity.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
In quantum physics,
we talk about there

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:84%
being many simultaneous
possibilities

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
and probabilities
all existing at once

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:84%
until a measurement or
observation, aka a choice,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:90%
is made.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Now upon observation, one
of those possibilities

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
will manifest out while
the others will disappear.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.370 align:middle line:84%
This is known as
the observer effect

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:90%
and collapsing the wave form.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.620 align:middle line:84%
How was this observer
effect discovered?

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It relates to another
aspect of complementarity

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.320 align:middle line:90%
known as wave particle duality.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.660 align:middle line:84%
In the early days of
quantum discovery,

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle line:84%
it began with scientists
trying to understand

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.250 align:middle line:90%
the nature of light.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Is it a wave?

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.340 align:middle line:90%
Or is it a particle?

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, light
displays both behaviors.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Now this confronted scientists
with a mystery, or paradox.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.130 align:middle line:84%
How can might be both
a wave and a particle?

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.900 align:middle line:84%
The paradigm at the
time said it must

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.460 align:middle line:90%
be either/or, not both/and.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And the mystery
grew when scientists

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:84%
began to wonder whether matter
also could behave as both wave

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:90%
and particle.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:90%
And, indeed, it could.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And there have been many
indications and new discoveries

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.720 align:middle line:84%
in quantum physics that
have confirmed all of this.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Now to make a long story short,
if they set up the experiment

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
to see if it's a wave
then, indeed, they

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:90%
get wave-like behavior.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:84%
But if they set
up the experiment

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to try and observe
it as a particle,

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
then the behavior changes
to that of a particle.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
It's all about how
the scientists choose

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to set up their observation
or measurement points.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Now what's
fascinating is that it

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
is as if the quanta are aware
that they're being observed.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
The very act of observing
has a dramatic effect

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:90%
on their behavior.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.855 align:middle line:90%
It is a real phenomenon.

00:12:59.855 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Now what is quantum physics
telling us about the underlying

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:90%
nature of the universe?

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
First, it reveals that
the universe is dual,

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.580 align:middle line:90%
or we can say complementary.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The things that we can
observe have a dual nature--

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:22.730 align:middle line:84%
wave, particle, position,
momentum, energy, time,

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.760 align:middle line:84%
each pair intricately
tied together.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.540 align:middle line:84%
In its quantum realm, it
can be both and neither.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.160 align:middle line:90%
It's all one.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.010 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum realm,
infinite possibilities

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:90%
exist simultaneously.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
It's a sea of possibility.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's non-dual.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But once we take a
measurement, or try

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.730 align:middle line:84%
to observe one of those
states in the physical,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.320 align:middle line:84%
that is when uncertainty
and duality enter in.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Upon observation, we come
to know about one aspect

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.830 align:middle line:84%
while sacrificing
the ability to know

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:90%
about its complementary partner.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Where this dual nature gets
reconciled back to oneness

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.200 align:middle line:84%
is in the quantum
realm, rather than

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
in this object-based observer
realm of the physical.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Now this brings us to
the second major quantum

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
principle that says that
things are contextual.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.290 align:middle line:84%
As the double-slit
experiments confirm,

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:90%
measurement alters the state.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Quantum behavior depends
on the conditions given.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, one way of
interpreting this

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:90%
is that things are meaningful.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:84%
We give meaning to things by
the act of observing them.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
The meaning we give depends
on the context or set

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of conditions we
choose to go with,

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:84%
or it depends on the
assumptions that we make.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Now this meaning emerges
from the interaction,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.910 align:middle line:84%
or the synergy, between the
observer and the observed.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.010 align:middle line:84%
Emergence of
different properties

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
is another hallmark of
quantum physics theories.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.990 align:middle line:84%
When various
particles and forces

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
are interacting under
certain conditions,

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:84%
entirely new things
can emerge out

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
of the quantum sea, things
that were not there before.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.665 align:middle line:84%
The whole becomes greater
than the sum of its parts.

00:15:12.665 --> 00:15:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Now here again, we
have the opposite

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:90%
of Newtonian reductionism.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.240 align:middle line:84%
At the metaphysical and
philosophical level,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:84%
this idea of context
begs the questions,

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.440 align:middle line:84%
did we perhaps
choose to come into

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
this object-based
experience of the physical

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
so that we could
observe ourselves,

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and so that we could observe
all the possible manifestations

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:90%
of the source?

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.050 align:middle line:90%
And by observing, come to know.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:90%
And by knowing, bestow meaning.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:10%
If so, does that mean that
we can give our own lives

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:10%
greater meaning,
especially when we put it

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:10%
into the context of a mission.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
A quantum mindset
would say, yes,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:90%
the universe is participatory.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We are co-creating, in
partnership with this universe,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.960 align:middle line:84%
through our observations
and choices.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.520 align:middle line:84%
This means that
our consciousness

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.410 align:middle line:84%
plays a vital role
in determining

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
what manifests out of the
quantum sea of possibilities.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:18.180 align:middle line:90%
Is the universe conscious?

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:90%
What is consciousness anyhow?

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Is it what the
materialists claim,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.650 align:middle line:84%
that it's just an
epiphenomenon of the brain

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:84%
or what emerges purely from
groups of molecules working

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:90%
together in a physical system?

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.880 align:middle line:84%
Or is consciousness more
fundamental to our universe,

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.750 align:middle line:84%
more primary, as the sages and
wisdom teachings of the planet

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:90%
have taught?

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
My personal view is that
consciousness is primary.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
How can something be
responsive to consciousness

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.020 align:middle line:84%
if it's not somehow sentient
or conscious itself?

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
Now fortunately, those of
us who view consciousness

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:84%
as the foundational
essence of the universe

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:90%
are in good company.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Several of the brilliant minds
who helped discover and develop

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
quantum theory
also believed this,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and they richly discussed it,
including John von Neumann,

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin
Schrodinger, Eugene Wigner,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.470 align:middle line:90%
and many others.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Max Planck even said, "I regard
consciousness as fundamental.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
I regard matter as derivative
from consciousness."

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:84%
We can also see this idea
of a participatory conscious

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
universe in many ancient
wisdom traditions.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.960 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the
"Hermetica," we read,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.010 align:middle line:84%
"Everything seen has been
begotten because at some point,

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:90%
it came to be seen.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in the
cosmos that does not live.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Life is not birth,
but awareness.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:50.940 align:middle line:84%
All are immortal-- matter,
life, spirit, soul, mind--

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.400 align:middle line:84%
of which everything
is constituted."

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:84%
One of the most mind-boggling
findings of quantum physics

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.330 align:middle line:84%
that has both intrigued
and baffled scientists

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:84%
is how quantum systems
that meet and interact

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.790 align:middle line:90%
are forever more entangled.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that they
can no longer be considered

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:16.470 align:middle line:84%
as individual, but have become
an intimately connected whole.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:90%
They form a single entity.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Even if the components are on
opposite ends of the universe,

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.340 align:middle line:84%
information is somehow
communicated between them

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
instantly, regardless
of how much

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.530 align:middle line:84%
time or space
passes between them.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Albert Einstein, who was a
staunch determinist to the end,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:84%
dubbed this phenomenon "voodoo
forces" and "spooky action

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.590 align:middle line:90%
at a distance."

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
This quantum discovery greatly
challenges the Newtonian idea

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
of separation, the idea that
things are independent and can

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:84%
only affect one another
by direct physical forces.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
How did the discovery of these
spooky actions come about?

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:84%
The idea goes back to 1935, when
the founders of quantum physics

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.100 align:middle line:84%
were trying to
understand and interpret

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.040 align:middle line:84%
the meaning of the new
quantum discoveries.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:10%
Niels Bohr, Werner
Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.030 align:middle line:10%
and their team who proposed
the Copenhagen interpretation

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:16.140 align:middle line:10%
thought that the qualities of
connectedness, uncertainty,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.350 align:middle line:10%
and the observer influence were
integral aspects of quantum

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:10%
physics.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.110 align:middle line:84%
The Copenhagen
interpretation says

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.080 align:middle line:84%
that there's no actual
physical property that

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.490 align:middle line:84%
exists in the real world
until it is observed.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:84%
This is better known today
as the observer effect.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Now Einstein, on the other
hand, thought this was crazy.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.470 align:middle line:84%
He stood staunchly in favor
of the deterministic, real,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.300 align:middle line:90%
separable world of Newton.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.450 align:middle line:84%
To demonstrate the absurdity
of the quantum theory,

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:84%
he and his colleagues
proposed a thought experiment

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:90%
known as the EPR paradox.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:54.090 align:middle line:84%
They pointed out that when
two particles, A and B,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
originating in unison
from the same source

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.670 align:middle line:84%
eject out in
opposite directions,

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.520 align:middle line:84%
they'll have correlated
properties for example,

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.490 align:middle line:84%
the spin of electrons or
the polarization of photons.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Now if an observer measures
the property of particle A,

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
then instantly, that
person will also

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.450 align:middle line:90%
know the result for particle B.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.570 align:middle line:10%
Now according to quantum
theory, this observation

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:10%
forced both particles
to pick a state out

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:10%
of the many possible states.

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And they must do so
in a correlated way

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
because of how they were created
together in the first place.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, particle B instantly
knows what state particle A

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.900 align:middle line:90%
ended up in upon observation.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
The problem,
according to Einstein,

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
was that this
instantaneous influence

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
would mean that information
has to travel faster

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
than the speed of light
from A to B in order

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.050 align:middle line:90%
to conserve their correlation.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.590 align:middle line:84%
This seemed to violate
special relativity which

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:84%
says that nothing can travel
faster than the speed of light.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:05.430 align:middle line:84%
It also says that the quantum
world must be non-local.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.820 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that
altering one quantum object

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:13.815 align:middle line:84%
can instantly influence
distant parts of the universe.

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Now here again, we encounter
a hermetic principle,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:84%
the principle of correspondence,
that says, as above, so below.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Or another way of saying this
is, as here, so elsewhere.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.250 align:middle line:84%
The choices we make really
can reach across the universe.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:10%
Even modern day theoretical
physicist Michio Kaku

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.900 align:middle line:10%
says, "It is impossible to
completely separate ourselves

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.610 align:middle line:10%
from the oneness
of the universe."

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
What else can quantum physics
reveal about our connection

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.320 align:middle line:90%
to the universe?

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, for one thing,
this connectedness

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:84%
is not just true
for particles that

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.680 align:middle line:90%
originate from the same source.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
In fact, any two quantum
systems that interact

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:90%
become entangled in some way.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
When particles are
entangled, we can only

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
describe one in relation
to its partners.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Even when entangled
systems fly galaxies apart,

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
they are never truly
separated and they

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
continue to influence each
other instantaneously.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the systems
that they interact

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:84%
with along their
journey also become

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
part of that entangled
whole and so on.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:90%
And this includes us too.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
We are entangled with
every particle we have ever

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:84%
interacted with,
including other people,

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.840 align:middle line:84%
and all the people and things
that they have interacted with,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.280 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the
implications of this.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:84%
Every subatomic particle
of light or energy

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.260 align:middle line:84%
that has ever traveled
to us, whether from Earth

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
or from outer space
and the stars,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.050 align:middle line:84%
if it's interacted
with our body,

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.260 align:middle line:84%
then it is still
entangled with us

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.350 align:middle line:84%
wherever it may now
be in the universe.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Plus, all the other
particles that it has ever

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.510 align:middle line:84%
interacted with are
also entangled with us

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.800 align:middle line:90%
because of this.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Talk about connectivity.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Even more amazing is if
the whole universe started

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
from a big bang
singularity, then

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:84%
that would say that
everything was entangled

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:84%
from the beginning and,
to some degree, still is.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
evidence suggests

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
that a kind of connectedness
extends not just

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
to quantum objects,
but also is found

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.710 align:middle line:84%
in evolutionary
biology, consciousness

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.410 align:middle line:90%
studies, and cosmology.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.370 align:middle line:90%
So what does this tell us?

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
This suggests that
non-local coherence

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.200 align:middle line:84%
may be a fundamental
aspect of reality.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.080 align:middle line:84%
It implies that beyond
energy and matter,

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.500 align:middle line:84%
there is information
intrinsic within the universe.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.670 align:middle line:84%
It is a special
kind of information

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that not only
transmits, it also plays

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:56.970 align:middle line:84%
a vital role of forming nature
at all scales from the quantum,

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.160 align:middle line:90%
to us, to the cosmos.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:03.270 align:middle line:84%
We truly are connected to
the stars and to each other.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:90%
We live in a connected universe.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.440 align:middle line:84%
This might sound cliche, but
this is physics, not just

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:90%
spiritual philosophy.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:84%
Yet it supports what
many spiritual teachers

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and initiates have said
through time, we are all one.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Is there a really here or there?

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:90%
At the quantum level, no.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Space does not really
exist or pose a limitation.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.490 align:middle line:84%
From the reference
frame, or quantum reality

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.400 align:middle line:84%
of entangled systems,
there's only here.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.800 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.530 align:middle line:90%
There's only one whole.

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.560 align:middle line:84%
What does quantum physics
have to say, then, about time?

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Is there a past,
present, and future?

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Does the arrow of time
only move forward?

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:90%
Is there a then and now?

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
The quantum answer
to that, also, is no.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Time does not impose
any limitations

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.970 align:middle line:90%
on the quantum realm.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Now this was
confirmed through what

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.730 align:middle line:84%
are known as the delayed-choice
experiments first proposed

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
by quantum cosmologist
John Wheeler.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And physicists have also
been able to demonstrate

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:84%
entanglement of particles
that never even coexisted

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:84%
in time using what is known
as entanglement swapping.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.730 align:middle line:84%
This means that quantum systems
are not bound by space or time.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:29.260 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to entangled
systems, all is here, now.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
This implies that space
time is not fundamental

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.780 align:middle line:90%
but rather, emergent.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And here again, we can see that
quantum connectedness is more

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:90%
fundamental than space or time.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.140 align:middle line:84%
So what does all
of this tell us?

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, we truly are connected
to the stars and to each other.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Why is this connectedness
so fundamental?

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Here again, we can turn
to the hermetic principle

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and teachings on correspondence.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.220 align:middle line:84%
The three initiates tell us
that this principle embodies

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:84%
the truth that there is
a harmony, agreement,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and correspondence
between the several planes

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.350 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The same laws and
characteristics

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:84%
apply at all levels because
it comes from the same source,

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:90%
the all.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Now whether scientists
realize it or not,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:27.010 align:middle line:84%
they have inherited their search
to understand the universe

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
from their predecessors,
many of whom

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:84%
were initiates in the
hermetic tradition.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.600 align:middle line:84%
The oral tradition
of hermetic teachings

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:84%
is said to date back
at least 8,000 years

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and has been kept
alive as sacred wisdom

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.330 align:middle line:84%
by the initiates of
the mystery schools.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Most scientists agree that there
should be a finite set of laws

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.600 align:middle line:90%
that govern the universe.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.810 align:middle line:84%
In physics, we talk about the
laws of general relativity,

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
quantum mechanics,
thermodynamics, and so forth.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.620 align:middle line:84%
But these laws are just
signposts pointing to a deeper

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.270 align:middle line:90%
truth that underlies them.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have long sought
to understand the mind of God,

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.490 align:middle line:84%
or what Einstein called the
secrets of the "Old One."

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.740 align:middle line:84%
They searched for a
theory of everything,

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.670 align:middle line:84%
one mathematical formula that
unites all laws of physics.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And in their heart
of hearts, many

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.330 align:middle line:84%
hoped to discover that the
universe is self-consistent,

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
that there is reason
and meaning to all

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.730 align:middle line:90%
that we observe and experience.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.020 align:middle line:90%
And there is.

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
But so long as scientists
remain rigidly opposed

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.630 align:middle line:84%
to bringing consciousness
into those laws,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:84%
they will fail to find a
true theory of everything.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.370 align:middle line:84%
The original as above,
so below principle

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:46.390 align:middle line:84%
comes from the ancient Emerald
Tablets of Thoth, Hermes.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:51.490 align:middle line:84%
The original statement reads,
"True, without error, certain

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.050 align:middle line:90%
and most true.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
That which is above is
as that which is below.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.300 align:middle line:84%
And that which is
below is as that

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:03.700 align:middle line:84%
which is above for performing
the miracles of the one thing

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and as all things were from
one by the meditation of one.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:14.110 align:middle line:10%
So from this one thing come
all things by adaptation."

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.720 align:middle line:10%
We can see in this
statement that there

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.030 align:middle line:10%
is a distinction made between
the one thing and the one mind.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
The miracles of the one
thing are the manifestations

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.640 align:middle line:84%
of the one into matter and
then the subsequent work

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:84%
to perfect and evolve
those things by adaptation

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.850 align:middle line:90%
or transformation.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:84%
But the one, itself,
is source, the all

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.450 align:middle line:90%
from which all things come.

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And it tells us that the
way these things come to be

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.780 align:middle line:90%
is by the meditation of one.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's look deeper at what
meditation means here.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is the focusing of
one's mind or total awareness

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:84%
until it comes completely
into a state of coherence.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Again, coherence
is a major key when

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the quantum realm.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
It means everything is aligned,
synchronized, and of one whole.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
a unified state.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:21.290 align:middle line:84%
In this coherent state, the mind
meditates upon the one thing

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.990 align:middle line:90%
it desires to manifest.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.600 align:middle line:10%
In the "Hermetica,"
Hermes tells his son Tat

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:10%
that "Everything seen has been
begotten because at some point,

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:10%
it came to be seen.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:37.070 align:middle line:10%
Coming to be is nothing
but imagination."

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:10%
That sounds a lot like
the observer effect.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Then Hermes says that the
one source is invisible

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:49.220 align:middle line:84%
because it always is and "what
begets is not itself begotten.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to see
God, consider the sun,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.690 align:middle line:84%
consider the
circuit of the moon,

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.850 align:middle line:90%
consider the order of the stars.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.760 align:middle line:90%
Who keeps this order?

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.582 align:middle line:10%
For there is nothing in all
the cosmos that God is not."

00:30:02.582 --> 00:30:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
like the word God,

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.190 align:middle line:84%
just replace it with source,
or universal consciousness,

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:08.720 align:middle line:90%
or whatever you prefer.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Now as all things are from
one, by the meditation of one,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.600 align:middle line:84%
hermeticists call this the
principle of mentalism.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:84%
The one, or the
all, may be thought

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:25.430 align:middle line:84%
of as a universal, infinite,
living mind, or perhaps, today,

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:29.690 align:middle line:84%
we might call it a unified
field of pure consciousness.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:84%
This is at the
foundation of everything.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It is within this one
mind that all is united.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.630 align:middle line:84%
So if physicists want to find
their theory of everything,

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:46.130 align:middle line:84%
they must include the
one mind, consciousness,

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.700 align:middle line:84%
as an essential
part of all that is.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Both Erwin Schrodinger
and Wolfgang Pauli,

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.010 align:middle line:84%
two of the founders
of quantum mechanics,

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:58.640 align:middle line:84%
had this insight of the
importance of the one mind.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.920 align:middle line:10%
Schrodinger, who studied
the "Upanishads,"

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.370 align:middle line:10%
once said, "Multiplicity
is only apparent.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:09.290 align:middle line:10%
In truth, there
is only one mind."

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.730 align:middle line:10%
And Pauli dedicated the last
half of his career and life

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.710 align:middle line:10%
to trying to understand
what he called

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.220 align:middle line:10%
the psychophysical problem,
or the mind/body problem

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.190 align:middle line:10%
from a scientific perspective.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Now how can we apply all
of this in our lives today?

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.540 align:middle line:84%
First of all, since
we are all connected,

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:84%
that means the changes
that we make within

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.840 align:middle line:90%
do matter to the universe.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.660 align:middle line:10%
As physicist John
Wheeler said, "Useful

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.150 align:middle line:10%
as it is under
everyday circumstances

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:45.320 align:middle line:10%
to say that the world exists
out there independent of us,

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.960 align:middle line:10%
that view can no
longer be upheld."

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.290 align:middle line:84%
When we work on improving
ourselves, healing

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning up our
thoughts, words, and deeds,

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.450 align:middle line:90%
it makes a difference.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:00.320 align:middle line:84%
When we transform from negative
to positive in our lives,

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.620 align:middle line:84%
we send good vibes
throughout the universe.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.610 align:middle line:84%
The outer is a
manifestation of the inner.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:09.860 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean for us?

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.740 align:middle line:84%
If we want our outer
life and our world

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.370 align:middle line:84%
as a whole to improve, we
must each start within.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, this shows us
that if there is a way

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to direct what comes out
of the quantum field,

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:84%
it will require more than
just choice or intention.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Those things are a beginning
and they might get us results,

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.540 align:middle line:90%
but they are random results.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:39.830 align:middle line:84%
What we need is to hold the
coherent intention connected

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:84%
to the one mind and meditate
upon the result we desire.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.860 align:middle line:84%
Only through a daily meditation
practice where we regularly

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:53.180 align:middle line:84%
quiet the lower mind will we
be able to consciously tap

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.640 align:middle line:90%
into the one mind.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Once we cultivate the ability to
hold a prolonged coherent state

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.840 align:middle line:84%
of being, that is
when we will become

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.310 align:middle line:84%
more effective participants
in the game of life.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Easier said than done, right?

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.800 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics gives
us other key insights

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.720 align:middle line:84%
into how to tap into that
unified state more easily.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:21.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.894 align:middle line:90%
