00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
and this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to travel
beyond our physical body

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:84%
while we're still
alive here on Earth?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.720 align:middle line:10%
Is this something we can
learn to do consciously?

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what mysteries
might it reveal to us?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.460 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel is defined
as the art and science

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
of expanding our consciousness
to travel beyond the body,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.150 align:middle line:90%
and often to the stars.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
We have this ability
to do this because we

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:90%
are infinite spiritual beings.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.320 align:middle line:90%
We are multidimensional beings.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel is a natural
part of our experience

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings operating
this vehicle that we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
call a physical body.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
We all astral travel naturally,
but most of the time,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:90%
we aren't conscious of it.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me share with
you a personal story

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
about some of my early
encounters with astral travel.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I learned about some of
my earliest experiences

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
with it from stories that my
mom shared with me that I really

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.620 align:middle line:90%
had no conscious memory of.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But apparently, when I was
just a three-month-old baby,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.730 align:middle line:84%
my mom had several waking
dreams where she'd look up

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.310 align:middle line:84%
and she'd see that I was flying
in circles over their bed.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.700 align:middle line:84%
She'd tell me come back
down, but I was just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:90%
having too much fun.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And according to her, this
became a nightly routine.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
Then there was one
night where she

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
heard me crying by
the bed in her dream,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and she kept trying
to pick me up.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And when she finally did,
apparently my head came off.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, my
mom thought she was

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:90%
going to die of a heart attack.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:84%
And when she startled awake,
I wasn't there, of course.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.120 align:middle line:84%
But then a few minutes later,
she did hear me crying,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.100 align:middle line:84%
so she jumped up out of
bed and ran into my room.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And when she saw that I was
OK and just wanted to be fed,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
she said to me, OK,
Theresa, that's enough.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
scare me to death.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Don't you ever do
that to me again.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Now at that point, she says
I looked at her with a smile,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and I gave her a wink at
just three months old.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And then she never
saw me do it again.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.660 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've always had a very
active and vivid dreamtime,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and much of it felt
very real, but it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
wasn't until I was an adult
that I consciously started

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:90%
to try astral travel again.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.340 align:middle line:84%
What's interesting is
that, as an adult, when

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I started to explore with
it, I really struggled.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I had a hard time,
because I had this sense

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.170 align:middle line:90%
of needing to be in control.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And not surprisingly,
it was my mom

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:84%
who brought astral travel
back into my life as an adult.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.020 align:middle line:84%
She was very involved
with the Monroe

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Institute, a group of
consciousness explorers

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:84%
who specialize in techniques
for journeying out of body.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
The Monroe Institute uses
technologies like binaural beat

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:84%
brainwave entrainment,
and various

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
visualizations to shift
into an altered state

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.660 align:middle line:90%
for astral travel.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
During my first time at their
week-long gateway program,

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
they taught us several
different visualizations to try.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
We'd lay down, and we'd imagined
floating up out of body,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:84%
or sitting up and
moving out that way.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.515 align:middle line:84%
We could barrel roll out, or we
could use the rake technique,

00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:40.890 align:middle line:84%
where it's like someone's
stepping on a rake at your feet

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:90%
and you pop out.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
We had all these
different techniques,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and we were instructed
to try all of them

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:90%
to find what works for us.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I was trying
these different methods,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that every time I
started to feel that shift out

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
of body, one of two things
would happen for me.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Either my mind would kick in, I
would say, oh, it's happening,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
and then that would
slam me back in again,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.710 align:middle line:84%
or I would feel disoriented,
and I'd snap back into my body

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.470 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't feel safe.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.410 align:middle line:84%
In the end, it was a
great week of training,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
but the way I ended
up doing it was

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to just sit up and project my
consciousness into a journey

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
while still maintaining
awareness of being in my body.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.410 align:middle line:84%
When I then later came to
the Modern Mystery School's

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
training on astral travel,
I found a technique

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.393 align:middle line:84%
that really worked reliably
for me and felt really safe.

00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
The method from
the Mystery School

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.990 align:middle line:84%
gave me a reliable tool
to confidently astral

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.260 align:middle line:84%
travel, which is why I am
thrilled to be able to share it

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:90%
with you today.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And before we get
into that, though,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.410 align:middle line:84%
let's get clear on the dos and
don'ts, as well as address some

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:84%
of the myths about
astral travel.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And even more
important is that we

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
need to get a better
understanding of why

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.720 align:middle line:84%
we would astral travel
in the first place.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
There is a whole purpose,
an art, to astral travel.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Now this brings up an
important question.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.610 align:middle line:84%
What is the purpose
of astral travel?

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel is
an art form that

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.420 align:middle line:84%
is about moving beyond our
normal everyday reality.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.940 align:middle line:84%
Our ultimate purpose
for astral travel

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is to progress toward our
full potential and divinity.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:90%
How does it help us do that?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
With astral travel, we
open up our perception

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.990 align:middle line:90%
of our multidimensionality.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.450 align:middle line:84%
We learn about ourselves
and our purpose,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and we can take what
we learn from it

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and then put it into
service in this world.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Some people want to use
astral travel to explore,

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and others are simply curious.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
Others may doubt
it's even possible,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and want to see if it's
something they can actually do.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And some people have a sense
that they're already doing it

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in their dreams, and
they want to learn

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:90%
how to do it consciously.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the reason may
be, my word of advice

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:84%
is that astral travel is
not to be used lightly.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It's not about becoming a
tourist on the astral plane,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and is definitely not to be
used for any sort of ill intent.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.410 align:middle line:84%
If you can believe
it, we've actually

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
had people inquire to
learn astral travel from us

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.350 align:middle line:84%
so that they could spy on a
boyfriend or girlfriend who

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.940 align:middle line:90%
they thought was cheating.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.020 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely not
to be used for that.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.180 align:middle line:84%
How would you change
your life if you

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.350 align:middle line:84%
knew that everything you
thought, said, and did

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:90%
was being recorded?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.890 align:middle line:90%
And who's recording it?

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:84%
You are, but you're recording
it from the perspective

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
of your higher self rather
than the personality.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the ways
we can use astral travel

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.780 align:middle line:84%
is to consciously
review those records.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.960 align:middle line:84%
We can become more aware of
our higher self's perspective

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:90%
on how we're living our life.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And with that
perspective, we can

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
see where we might want to
make adjustments to be more

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
on track, and live
life in greater

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:90%
alignment with our higher self.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.270 align:middle line:84%
How exactly does
this happen well,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.540 align:middle line:84%
you may not have realized
it, but you're already very

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
experienced with astral travel.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:90%
Many people aren't aware of it.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Many people don't even think
that they dream at night.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But I can assure you
everyone does it,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:90%
whether we remember it or not.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
This means we already have
this ability innate within us.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
We just need to remember
it and become conscious

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
of the process of
actually doing it.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to that recording
of our thoughts, words,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:90%
and deeds.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:90%
How does this work?

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, every night when we
sleep, as we go into the deepest

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.530 align:middle line:84%
parts of our sleep
cycle, we reach

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
a very slow delta brainwave
state of less than 3 Hertz.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.700 align:middle line:90%
It's a dreamless sleep.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in this
state, our higher self

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
guides us up out of our body,
up through a tunnel of light,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:84%
and we travel into the higher
spiritual plains, all the way

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.240 align:middle line:84%
up to what's called
the Akashic Zone.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.809 align:middle line:84%
And there, we record
everything that we thought,

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:90%
said, and did that day.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
This is something everyone
does without exception.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:90%
What, exactly, is astral travel?

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word astral is derived
from the Greek word astron,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.750 align:middle line:90%
meaning star.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.910 align:middle line:84%
The word was originally
used by the Greeks

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:84%
to describe the
home of the gods.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:84%
These gods lived among the
stars such as Mars and Venus,

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter, and the constellations.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The art and science
of astral travel

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
is learning how to
consciously shift

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
what's called our assemblage
point beyond our body.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.950 align:middle line:84%
The assemblage point
is the vantage point

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.860 align:middle line:84%
from where we
perceive and assemble

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
our view of the
universe around us.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Although astral travel is
often depicted as though we're

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
leaving the body behind, we
don't actually leave the body

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:90%
when we astral travel.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I say that because our
spirit is infinite.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're simply
shifting our perspective

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.140 align:middle line:84%
to another point within
our infinite spirit.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.940 align:middle line:84%
We're moving the
assemblage point

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
from point A, which tends
to be here in the body,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
usually around the
head, to point B,

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:90%
wherever we decide that to be.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Surprisingly, one of
the biggest challenges

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
is that we're actually
always astral traveling.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
It's not just when we're asleep
or trying to do it consciously.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.540 align:middle line:84%
We're astral traveling
throughout our day.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:84%
In fact, our astral
travel experience

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.800 align:middle line:84%
can be so real that we may have
trouble making the distinction.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I mean is that we're
always traveling in the mind.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:84%
So where is our
mind traveling to?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it in the past?

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:90%
The future?

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.680 align:middle line:90%
The now?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Are we daydreaming?

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Are we living in
a fantasy world?

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Or are we present
in the here and now?

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're not in
the here and now,

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
truly present with
what's in front of you,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.090 align:middle line:90%
then where are you?

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And for that matter,
are we really even here,

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:90%
in this physical life on Earth?

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Or is this just a projection
from the hologram?

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we're really at
the Great Central Sun,

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and our assemblage point
is just projected here

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.510 align:middle line:90%
into this density level.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:84%
That's a concept we
discussed in season one.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:84%
Some mystery teachings say that
we're always astral traveling,

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:84%
except for when we're
in the here and now,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
fully connected to our
divinity and fully conscious

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.050 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
So how do we get our awareness
fully into the here and now?

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
The key is to understand
our multidimensional nature.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel gives us a way
to explore and experience

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.110 align:middle line:90%
this multidimensional reality.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Through learning this art,
we can strengthen our focus

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.750 align:middle line:90%
and become more aware.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.970 align:middle line:84%
We can stop wandering
in the mind,

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and start to get clear
about where we really

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
are within our
multidimensional experience.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Most people aren't
approaching life

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.140 align:middle line:84%
from a multidimensional
awareness.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.290 align:middle line:84%
We get so focused on
this physical dimension.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:84%
But even then, with such a
narrow focus, how much of it

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:90%
are we really even conscious of?

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.100 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to perceive
a wide range of frequencies

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.580 align:middle line:84%
using our five physical
and five spiritual senses,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.250 align:middle line:84%
yet most people are
only consciously

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:17.240 align:middle line:84%
aware of less than 5% to
10% of what's coming in.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
This is a very
one-dimensional way of living.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
But we are
multidimensional, which

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:84%
means that we are operating
on multiple dimensions

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Every time we
astral travel, we're

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
developing our
conscious connection

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:90%
with these other dimensions.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.050 align:middle line:84%
In season one, we talked
about our multidimensionality

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and the metaphor of having
22 archetypal extensions

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:90%
of our true self.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.000 align:middle line:10%
It's like these archetypes
are playing out 22 movies,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.060 align:middle line:10%
and we're the lead
actor in each of these.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways we
can use astral travel

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
is to visit these
parallel lives.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.610 align:middle line:84%
We can get to know who
we are in our fullness,

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and the archetypes
that are a part

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.890 align:middle line:90%
of our multidimensional self.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.160 align:middle line:84%
A big part of achieving
our full potential

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
is to become fully aware
of our multidimensionality,

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and then bring it all into one.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
As we become aware, we can
start to merge these aspects

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:90%
into one experience.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
This is what it means
to consciously live

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:90%
a multidimensional life.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.310 align:middle line:84%
This is actually one
of the biggest reasons

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:90%
to use astral travel.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a tool to awaken
ourselves so fully that we

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.310 align:middle line:84%
develop deeper connection
to our multidimensionality.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Let's back up a moment.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:90%
How do we define consciousness?

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.410 align:middle line:84%
Science often
defines consciousness

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.340 align:middle line:84%
as a byproduct of the brain,
but our true consciousness

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.820 align:middle line:90%
exists beyond our physical body.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:84%
According to the first Hermetic
Principle of Mentalism,

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:05.870 align:middle line:84%
the all is mind, meaning
spirit is primary.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
This intelligent spirit is
how we define consciousness,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.360 align:middle line:84%
and the universal mind
really has nothing

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.790 align:middle line:90%
to do with this physical body.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
The body is a vehicle for
individuated expression

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:84%
of the universal mind,
and we can easily

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.350 align:middle line:90%
move out of this vehicle.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.370 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to astral travel,
the biggest challenges we face

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:84%
are the limitations
within our own mind.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Our fears and limiting
beliefs will prevent us

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:84%
from experiencing our
multidimensionality.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
What are some of these fears
that we may need to overcome?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Well, one common fear that
people have with astral travel

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.688 align:middle line:84%
is related to the myth
of the silver cord.

00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
literature out there

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
that says that when
we astral travel,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.170 align:middle line:84%
there is a silver cord that
connects us to our body.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
The fear is that if the
silver cord was ever severed,

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:84%
we could lose our
way, and if we're

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
unable to get our way back
to our body, we might die.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.000 align:middle line:90%
But not to worry.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:90%
This is a myth.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The fear has been
used to scare people

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:84%
from ever trying the art
of astral travel, which

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:90%
is a huge disservice.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel is such
an important tool

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
for us to experience and
identify our true self

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:90%
beyond our physical body.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:90%
We are multidimensional.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.860 align:middle line:90%
We are eternal beings.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
We have never been born, and
therefore we can never die.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
To be fed this fear that
if we leave our body,

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:90%
we might die or get lost?

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:90%
That's incredibly disempowering.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
It's reinforcing the
idea that we are our body

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:90%
and that our body is everything.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.860 align:middle line:84%
In truth, the silver
cord is an illusion

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.910 align:middle line:84%
that the mind creates so that
we have some sense of control.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.910 align:middle line:84%
We never need to
be afraid of that.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.380 align:middle line:84%
The worst thing
that would happen

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.320 align:middle line:84%
if we lost conscious awareness
while astral traveling,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
such as if we fell
asleep, is that we'd just

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.040 align:middle line:90%
wake up again in our body.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
Our higher self will
take over and get us

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:90%
back to where we need to be.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Another fear that may come
up is that of losing control.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
When I first started to
consciously astral travel,

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:90%
I struggled with this fear.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And it was coming from some
place very deep within.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:84%
At that time, I
was honestly trying

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.780 align:middle line:84%
to control all
aspects of my life.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.590 align:middle line:84%
I was very much a
type A personality.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.860 align:middle line:84%
But those fears are
not founded on reality.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
They're based on our own
deep-seated subconscious fears.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, it's about
not trusting ourselves.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.575 align:middle line:84%
We're not trusting spirit
to guide and protect us.

00:16:51.575 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
Now having said that, it's
important to be mindful

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to astral travel.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:84%
There are some
essential guidelines

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.100 align:middle line:90%
that we want to follow.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Today's new age
approach can often

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.319 align:middle line:84%
be a free-for-all of
do whatever you want,

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
but that can get
us into trouble.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:84%
As with all things, we
need to use discernment.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
When we don't use the proper
methods to astral travel,

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
we can actually cause
stress to the energy body.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.520 align:middle line:84%
We see the results
of this in people

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
who have an emergency room
or near-death experience

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.700 align:middle line:90%
type of out-of-body process.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.250 align:middle line:84%
In these cases, their
conscious awareness

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
usually is thrown out through
whatever chakra is most open.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.340 align:middle line:84%
This process causes
trauma to that chakra,

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and then when they
come back in, it

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.350 align:middle line:84%
can be more difficult
to reintegrate.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Their psychic
centers may sometimes

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:84%
be more opened from this,
but there's less control.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:54.980 align:middle line:84%
It can lead also to a
healing crisis experience.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.250 align:middle line:84%
People who I've talked
with who've had NDEs often

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
say how traumatic
their reentry was,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and that they wouldn't
wish that on anybody.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they come back
knowing that we are

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.290 align:middle line:90%
more than our physical body.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.830 align:middle line:84%
They had this experience
of this whole other realm

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:17.900 align:middle line:84%
beyond the physical,
and it's beautiful.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that we don't need

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.410 align:middle line:84%
to have a near-death
experience to gain access.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.230 align:middle line:84%
We just need to open
our mind and gain

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.168 align:middle line:84%
the right tools to work
with this in a safe way.

00:18:31.168 --> 00:18:32.960 align:middle line:84%
These tools have been
taught by the mystery

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:90%
schools for thousands of years.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:84%
When I came to the
mystery school's method

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.400 align:middle line:84%
of astral travel, it gave
me really clear guidelines

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:84%
of what I was doing, and a clear
method to help me feel safe.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to help
people use the tools well

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.410 align:middle line:84%
and safely, and really
recognize how they can help

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.440 align:middle line:90%
us reach our full potential.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:84%
When we come to astral travel
with the proper awareness,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.010 align:middle line:84%
methods, and guidelines,
we can enjoy and greatly

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.650 align:middle line:90%
benefit from these experiences.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.570 align:middle line:90%
So what do we need to know?

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a deeper look at some
of the dos and don'ts of astral

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.090 align:middle line:90%
travel.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Number one is to be respectful
and follow the universal laws.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
These include the laws of
spirit, laws of nature,

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:90%
and the laws of the universe.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.390 align:middle line:90%
What are these laws?

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, we need to
respect privacy and free will.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
We should never impose ourselves
on someone else's privacy

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.900 align:middle line:90%
or free will.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
Violating another's
will is essentially

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.400 align:middle line:90%
a form of black magic.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:90%
Doing so has consequences.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.220 align:middle line:90%
There is karma for it.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.720 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
at some point,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
whether later in this
life or in the afterlife,

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
those people who do
will have to face

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.480 align:middle line:84%
the consequences of violating
another person's free will.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Their health might
deteriorate and they get sick,

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.050 align:middle line:84%
or they might lose their ability
to use their spiritual gifts.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Or they might become
unstable within their mind.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.100 align:middle line:10%
It can show up in different
ways for different people.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:10%
The way Dean Radin puts it
in his book "Real Magic"

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:10%
he says "within the magical
worldview everything

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:10%
is deeply interconnected, so
if you intend to harm others,

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.470 align:middle line:10%
you are likely to end
up harming yourself."

00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.380 align:middle line:84%
This is not just because
of a guilty conscience,

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
but more like
Newton's third law.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
For every action, there's an
equal and opposite reaction.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say it
would be exceedingly

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.060 align:middle line:90%
prudent to avoid black magic.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, there
have been some cases

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
where remote viewing was
used by various governments

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to gather intelligence and
essentially spy on people.

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.150 align:middle line:84%
When they were just testing
it for its viability,

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.960 align:middle line:90%
there was no harm done.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
But for those who moved on to
become official remote viewers

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
for a top secret program to spy
on enemy bases, some of them

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
later suffered the
consequences, depending

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:07.580 align:middle line:84%
on the extent and purpose in
the use of their abilities.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:84%
That's partly because
they were infringing

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
on this spiritual law of
privacy and free will.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.710 align:middle line:84%
It was a violation of
other human beings.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, they
even went so far as

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:23.930 align:middle line:84%
to have express intent to do
harm to so-called enemy forces.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
people can't do it.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They can, but it goes
against the laws of spirit,

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:90%
and thus there are consequences.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:36.480 align:middle line:84%
Also realize that this
isn't so black and white.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.020 align:middle line:90%
There is a large gray zone here.

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you stick with the
guidelines I'm giving you,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:46.730 align:middle line:84%
you'll be able to steer
clear of those darker areas.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:84%
People who accrue too
much negative karma

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.440 align:middle line:84%
from using spiritual
tools in such ways

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.920 align:middle line:84%
can often burn out or struggle
with psychological tensions

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.630 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:84%
But often, they don't realize
it until it's too late,

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
or they might never
connect the dots

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.550 align:middle line:84%
to realize these
incidents are consequences

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:90%
of their misuse of power.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:84%
We only want to use
astral travel for good.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:90%
There should be no ill intent.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We do this for our own personal
progression and learning,

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
ultimately apply it

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.795 align:middle line:84%
in a way that will be
in service to the whole.

00:22:20.795 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.350 align:middle line:84%
Another general rule of thumb
is to stay in the light.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.460 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're astral
traveling through the universe,

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and you set your destination
somewhere out in space,

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.670 align:middle line:84%
be sure to visit
places that have light.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Like stars and planets are
good to visit, but avoid

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.040 align:middle line:90%
places like black holes.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.530 align:middle line:84%
The physics of black
holes is that they destroy

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.630 align:middle line:90%
things, so don't go there.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:90%
That's just common sense.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.400 align:middle line:84%
One way to stay safe is by
aligning with divine will.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.940 align:middle line:84%
Align with the light, and
stay focused on the light.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:03.470 align:middle line:84%
We do this by becoming
one with our divinity.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:84%
Why do we want to
align with the light?

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:90%
Well, think of it like this.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.270 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to shifting
our consciousness

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.540 align:middle line:84%
into the astral realms,
we need to understand

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.170 align:middle line:90%
that like attracts like.

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:19.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a universal
law when it comes

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.360 align:middle line:84%
to the spiritual and
astral dimensions.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.050 align:middle line:90%
So what do you want to attract?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.070 align:middle line:84%
My guess is that you want to
have a positive experience.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The energies that will
be attracted to us

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.310 align:middle line:84%
are the things that are like
us at an energetic level.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:84%
If we bring in negativity,
we'll attract negative energy.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.020 align:middle line:84%
But if we bring in positivity,
then that's what we'll attract.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:84%
We draw to us the things that
vibrate at the same frequency

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.970 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.040 align:middle line:84%
So it's best to take
time to prepare ourselves

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and to get into a peaceful,
positive state of being.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.560 align:middle line:90%
How do we prepare ourselves?

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
three areas that we

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
need to prepare before we begin
our astral travel journey.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
These are our environment,
our body, and our mind.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, our environment
should be clean and organized.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.070 align:middle line:84%
We want to avoid clutter
or too much chaos.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.340 align:middle line:84%
Those things affect
our state of mind.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The next area we need to
repair is our physical body.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.950 align:middle line:84%
Just like having a
clean space, it's

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
important that our physical
body is clean, too.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.070 align:middle line:84%
We can prepare with
a warm shower or bath

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.870 align:middle line:90%
to help us relax.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's best to be relaxed
and also well-rested

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:44.170 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't fall
asleep during the journey.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
It's good to wear comfortable,
loose-fitting clothes,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's helpful if we haven't
eaten too much before starting.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Also, avoid caffeine
or chocolate,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.710 align:middle line:84%
and don't use any
drugs, alcohol,

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.150 align:middle line:84%
or mind-altering substances
before astral travel.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:07.510 align:middle line:84%
We need to be clear, focused,
and in control of our mind.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Preparing the mind is key
to successful astral travel.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.250 align:middle line:84%
We want the mind to
be calm and tranquil,

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:84%
not focused on the
stress of life.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Also, when we consciously
astral travel,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.080 align:middle line:84%
we are responsible for
directing our journey,

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.370 align:middle line:84%
so we have to have a clear
idea of where we're going.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.640 align:middle line:84%
It's up to us to pick the
exact location or dimension

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.130 align:middle line:84%
that we're traveling to,
including how to get there.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:40.620 align:middle line:84%
One step that is
very important when

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.570 align:middle line:84%
it comes to preparing
our environment

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.420 align:middle line:90%
is to create sacred space.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:48.420 align:middle line:84%
This sacred space protects
us during the astral travel

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.040 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hand down
to you a tool called

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:90%
the circle of protection.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
you can use to create

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.290 align:middle line:90%
sacred space for your journey.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
We start with our hands
in a triangle position,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.880 align:middle line:84%
with the thumbs and
index fingers touching.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.040 align:middle line:84%
We then turn it
over and point it

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:84%
at the hara, just about
an inch below the navel.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.790 align:middle line:84%
With intention
and visualization,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.280 align:middle line:84%
we breathe with chi
while tracing out

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.350 align:middle line:90%
a circle around the seat.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Be sure to touch the thumbs
and index fingers here again

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.750 align:middle line:84%
at the far end of the
circle to close it.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Then retrace the circle
and bring the fingers back

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.170 align:middle line:90%
to touching again at the hara.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.220 align:middle line:84%
We repeat this movement two
more times for a total of three.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And voila, this establishes
a circle of protection

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.090 align:middle line:90%
around your seat.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Next, let's work
with three exercises

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.930 align:middle line:84%
that build our foundation
for safe astral travel.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.150 align:middle line:84%
These exercises
can be done daily

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.870 align:middle line:84%
to start building those
energetic muscles.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.740 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to astral travel,
we need to stay focused.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.640 align:middle line:84%
This relies on our ability
to discipline our will

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.590 align:middle line:84%
and keep our attention
focused on a singular point.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Our body position
for this technique

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.070 align:middle line:84%
is best done sitting up with
the spine somewhat straight.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Before starting
these exercises, plan

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.540 align:middle line:84%
for at least 15
minutes of meditation

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.180 align:middle line:90%
to relax and calm your mind.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Begin transitioning into
that alpha brainwave state

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
of 8 to 15 Hertz, and breathing
in, just relaxing your body,

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.430 align:middle line:84%
allowing your attention to
shift into the inner planes.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Connect to your divinity and
feel that positive energy

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
flowing through you.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.650 align:middle line:84%
After 15 minutes of meditation,
then move into these exercises.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Each exercise can
be done for one week

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.620 align:middle line:90%
before moving on to the next.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:84%
So on week one, begin
working with the image

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:90%
of a dot on a wall.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.930 align:middle line:84%
It can be a black
dot on a white wall,

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.380 align:middle line:90%
or a white dot on a black wall.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
If it helps you,
you can first do

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.480 align:middle line:84%
it physically, with
construction paper

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.770 align:middle line:84%
or using a black circle on a
blank piece of white paper.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the dot with your
eyes open for five minutes,

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:84%
then close your eyes
for five minutes.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Set a timer, and when
you close your eyes,

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.480 align:middle line:84%
recreate the dot on the
wall within your mind.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Hold the image.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Notice how much
your mind wanders.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.940 align:middle line:84%
When you catch your
mind wandering,

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
gently bring it back
to the dot on the wall,

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.100 align:middle line:90%
and hold that focus.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Building focus is
an essential part

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:58.810 align:middle line:84%
of being able to direct and
control our astral travel

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.520 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Practice this four times a day
for five to 10 minutes each

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.510 align:middle line:84%
The more you do this dot
on the wall exercise,

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
the more you will find that
you can control your mind

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.555 align:middle line:84%
and hold your focused attention
on that singular point.

00:29:14.555 --> 00:29:17.120 align:middle line:90%


00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.600 align:middle line:84%
On week two, we'll add
on to this exercise.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Once you've firmly established
the dot on the wall

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.210 align:middle line:84%
within your mind, hold that
focus for five minutes.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Next, imagine the dot expanding.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Expand the dot until it
touches the edges of the wall.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:42.020 align:middle line:84%
As the dot expands,
this now represents

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:84%
the veil between the
physical and astral planes.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:50.660 align:middle line:84%
In your mind, you can go up to
this expanded dot and feel it.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.580 align:middle line:84%
You can even pass
your hand through it

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.280 align:middle line:90%
and get a sense of its texture.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't move through
it entirely yet.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Just keep working
with controlling

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:middle line:84%
the expansion of the dot and
get familiar with the veil.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, continue working with
this exercise four times a day

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.390 align:middle line:90%
for about 10 minutes each time.

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:15.830 align:middle line:84%
Then on week three, we're ready
to start astral traveling.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Prepare by having
your destination

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:90%
in mind before you begin.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Get clear on it.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Plan it out and
then write it down.

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:29.330 align:middle line:84%
It may be helpful to set a
timer for about 30 to 45 minutes

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:84%
to control the length
of your journey.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Remember to prepare your
physical space, your body,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and your mind before you begin.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, start with
the dot on the wall as before,

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:49.400 align:middle line:84%
then expand it to touch
the edges of the wall.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you go up to
touch it this time,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:55.690 align:middle line:84%
visualize it extending
to become a tunnel.

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:00.070 align:middle line:84%
Keep your destination in mind,
and now move through the tunnel

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.640 align:middle line:90%
to your destination.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:05.890 align:middle line:84%
With astral travel, we can
move at the speed of thought

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:09.550 align:middle line:84%
to anywhere that our
mind can visualize.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
picking a destination,

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.820 align:middle line:84%
we can astral travel
anywhere that we can imagine,

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.470 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be a
place we know exists.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a place we can
locate on a map,

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:26.200 align:middle line:84%
or have some kind of knowing
or clarity in mind about how

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:90%
to navigate there.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.760 align:middle line:84%
If we've been there before,
or we've seen images of it,

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and we can visualize that
place or specific location,

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.940 align:middle line:90%
then we can travel there.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.880 align:middle line:84%
It could be any place on
Earth, or even some place out

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:84%
in space, like a
star or a planet,

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.350 align:middle line:84%
but we need to have a specific
image and a general direction

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.940 align:middle line:84%
relative to where we are now
in order to know where to go.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Google Maps and
NASA images can be

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.400 align:middle line:84%
very helpful to identify
where we're going.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Once we pass through
the tunnel, we're

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.800 align:middle line:84%
traveling at the
speed of thought,

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
which is why it is so important
to control our thoughts.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:90%
It's instantaneous.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
We set our intention
on where we're going,

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes
our focus point.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.020 align:middle line:90%
And in an instant, we're there.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It can be that fast.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.670 align:middle line:90%


00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.230 align:middle line:84%
If you stick to
these guidelines,

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:27.310 align:middle line:84%
you'll have a safe
experience and be in control.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, these steps that I've
given here are just a start,

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.670 align:middle line:84%
but if you feel really
ready to take it deeper,

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I recommend seeking out
a guide with a higher

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:40.120 align:middle line:84%
training and ability to hand
down the more advanced methods.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Through in-person
training, we can

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:46.000 align:middle line:84%
be supported in the
proper energetic space,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to set that
space at the next level

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:84%
for our ongoing
practice at home.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:57.160 align:middle line:84%
One of the main ways that we use
higher forms of astral travel

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.150 align:middle line:84%
is to access the seven spiritual
dimensions, a place known

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.270 align:middle line:84%
as the Akashic Zone, and the
realms of spiritual beings.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:07.150 align:middle line:90%


00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.160 align:middle line:84%
When we raise our
consciousness up

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.620 align:middle line:84%
to the seventh
spiritual dimension,

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:84%
our personality filters
get cleared out of the way

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.400 align:middle line:84%
so that we can have a more
authentic experience of higher

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.410 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:84%
In order to access
that, it requires

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.480 align:middle line:84%
having the right
keys so that we can

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.810 align:middle line:84%
move through the other
layers of the veil

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.950 align:middle line:84%
to get all the way up to
the seventh spiritual plane.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Those keys are what we call
the Three Keys to Heaven,

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.960 align:middle line:84%
and they're handed down
orally in the mystery schools.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.710 align:middle line:84%
That's because it's
not just about knowing

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.980 align:middle line:84%
what they are, but
about actually awakening

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.880 align:middle line:90%
those energies within you.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Before we conclude, I
have one final question.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.490 align:middle line:84%
What kind of
attitude do you think

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.830 align:middle line:84%
is most important
when astral traveling?

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with having a clear
purpose for why we are astral

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.470 align:middle line:90%
traveling.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:84%
And the best
attitude is to use it

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:10.810 align:middle line:84%
