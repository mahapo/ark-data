00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.200 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Can we heal our bodies
using pure vibration?

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.700 align:middle line:10%
Vibrational medicine
is a growing field.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:10%
More people are using
emerging technologies

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.250 align:middle line:10%
based on vibrational
energy as ways

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:10%
to diagnose and treat
various issues in the bodies.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.460 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
The basic idea behind
vibrational medicine

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
is that a healthy body has
certain homeostasis, where

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:84%
the vibrations and
frequencies within the body

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:90%
are in harmony with each other.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.780 align:middle line:84%
The body should be
synchronized like a symphony.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:84%
And that symphony should
be harmonious and pleasant.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.920 align:middle line:84%
But when disease sets in,
it creates disharmony.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Vibrations clash and
there is discord.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Scientific theories,
including string theory

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
and the holographic model,
align with this idea

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.310 align:middle line:84%
of using vibrational
healing methods as a way

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:84%
to bring the body into
greater harmony and alignment.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Our physical bodies
are constantly

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:84%
emitting electricity, magnetic
energy, and biophotons.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:90%
We are electromagnetic beings.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
We know that our brain creates
an electromagnetic field that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.450 align:middle line:84%
can be detected with
EEG and MEG devices.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the heart
produces an even larger energy

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:84%
field, with an electric field
that is 60 times greater than

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.220 align:middle line:84%
that of the brain, while the
magnetic field is a hundred

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:90%
times greater than the brain's.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
With today's
detector sensitivity,

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.990 align:middle line:84%
the heart field has been
measured up to three feet,

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
or one meter out from the body,
although it is likely much

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.760 align:middle line:90%
larger.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have new
technologies that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.430 align:middle line:84%
are gaining popularity in the
field of vibrational medicine.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds of
biofeedback machines, where

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.580 align:middle line:84%
we can place our hand
on a plate and scan

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.090 align:middle line:84%
for thermal conductivity,
measure heart rate variability,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:90%
and other frequencies.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Measuring these
signals can help us

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
to identify inharmonious
frequencies in the body.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.420 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that we can
also treat those harmonies

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.110 align:middle line:84%
by feeding in the proper
vibrational signals needed

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to restore the system
to homeostasis.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Light and color are also
used in vibrational medicine.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Today, we are seeing more and
more therapeutic applications

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:90%
of LEDs and light lasers.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Electromagnetic energy, such as
ultraviolet, visible, infrared,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.450 align:middle line:84%
and other frequencies, affect
matter at different scales.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.840 align:middle line:10%
Photons generally interact
at the atomic level,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:10%
exciting electrons or even
ionizing them out of orbit.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
Magnetic resonance devices
have also been made available.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that the
magnetic field of the heart

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.980 align:middle line:84%
extends three feet
in all directions.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
This is also the
range of what we

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:84%
consider to be our personal
space within our working aura.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:90%
The aura is in constant motion.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And it is flowing, not
only physical energies,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.420 align:middle line:84%
like magnetic and
electric fields,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.190 align:middle line:84%
but also the subtle energies
of etheric, the elements,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
the dimensions, the
chakras, and more.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:10%
The purpose and action
of this workflow

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:10%
is to pull in all the energies
from the spiritual realms

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.280 align:middle line:10%
and from the universe
into and through our body.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:10%
As it moves through
us, it then flows out

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.040 align:middle line:10%
through the toroidal
structure of our aura,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:10%
out into our environment.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is happening
within our body, mind, and soul

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:90%
is reflected in our aura.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Western medicine focuses
primarily on the physical body,

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.170 align:middle line:90%
as if that's all there is.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:10%
But in metaphysics,
using the tree of life

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:10%
as a map or blueprint, we
see that the physical world

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.040 align:middle line:10%
is the bottom of
the tree, receiving

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:10%
all the energies
from the Ein Sof,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.550 align:middle line:10%
or the source, down through
the other nine Sefirot,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.370 align:middle line:10%
into manifestation in
the physical world.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Through this, we
see that the cause

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.030 align:middle line:84%
is almost always happening
on higher levels of the tree.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
While the physical
manifestation shows the effect,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.570 align:middle line:84%
the body is receiving
the imbalanced energies

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:90%
from higher levels.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.520 align:middle line:84%
It is within our subconscious
patterns, our mind, thoughts,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
emotions, and soul where the
true imbalances are typically

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:90%
rooted.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:10%
These imbalances affect
our choices and actions,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:10%
thereby getting
pulled into the body

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.060 align:middle line:10%
and then reflected
out into the aura.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.970 align:middle line:84%
We can read all of
these energy systems

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.300 align:middle line:84%
without the need for
vibrational devices.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
We have been doing this
for thousands of years

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:90%
within spiritual traditions.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Mystery schools train
people to become

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:84%
healers, who can sense
the subtle energies

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:90%
within the field.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Some people are born
with such gifts.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
For example, Edgar
Cayce, who was

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
known as the Sleeping
Prophet, would

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.090 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed people's illnesses
while in a state of trance.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
He would then successfully
prescribe natural remedies

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to address the issues.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.650 align:middle line:84%
But regardless of whether or
not we are born with such gifts

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.430 align:middle line:84%
turned on, we all have
these capabilities.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And through proper training,
we can turn them on over time.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Such traditions have been
around for a long time.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Yet now we also
have technologies

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't have before.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.140 align:middle line:84%
How can these technologies be
used and what are their limits?

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Masaru Emoto was very
dedicated to the field

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.810 align:middle line:90%
of vibrational medicine.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.260 align:middle line:10%
In his book, "Truth
of Hado" he writes,

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:10%
All substances and
phenomenon have

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:10%
their own unique
magnetic resonance.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.890 align:middle line:10%
This resonance field is
due to what he called Hado.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:84%
"Hado" is a Japanese
term that relates

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to the intrinsic
vibrational essence.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.960 align:middle line:84%
Emoto described Hado as
the specific vibrating wave

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:84%
generated by the
electrons orbiting

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.350 align:middle line:90%
the nucleus of an atom.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
But really, Hado is much
more than that, as we'll see.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.750 align:middle line:10%
Emoto and his team
conducted many studies

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:10%
using magnetic
resonance analyzers

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.800 align:middle line:10%
to identify imbalances
within organs and tissues.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:10%
When a harmful vibrational
signal was detected,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.950 align:middle line:10%
they would use the
device to imprint water

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.380 align:middle line:10%
with a neutralizing vibration.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:10%
This imprinted vibrational
water was then taken

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:10%
as a homeopathic
remedy to neutralize

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:10%
the disharmony in the body.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:84%
However, Dr. Emoto
discovered the state

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.720 align:middle line:84%
of the practitioner
greatly affected

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:84%
the operation of the
device and their ability

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:90%
to get consistent results.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.120 align:middle line:84%
To get consistent
results, it really

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
depends on having a
well-trained operator who

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:84%
could hold the right vibrational
state within themselves

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:90%
and their mind.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Emoto used water
as a medium to show

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.930 align:middle line:10%
how our vibrational
essence impacts materia.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:10%
He demonstrated this phenomenon
with his famous photographs

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.600 align:middle line:10%
of water crystals,
that were imprinted

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:10%
with either harmonious or
disharmonious energies.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.490 align:middle line:10%
Positive thoughts, like
love, generated harmony,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.910 align:middle line:10%
while negative thoughts, like
hate, generated disharmony.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.090 align:middle line:84%
To Dr. Emoto, these
water crystals

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:90%
were a visual display of Hado.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies are 70% water.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:84%
His work shows that our words,
our thoughts, and our emotions

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:90%
have an impact.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Emoto rediscovered this.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.280 align:middle line:90%
But it is not actually new.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.460 align:middle line:10%
Alchemists have known for
ages that the alchemist

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.550 align:middle line:10%
and their experiment
are interconnected.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.100 align:middle line:84%
They realized how
the vibrational state

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:84%
of the alchemist affects
the vibrational state

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
of whatever they're working on.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.690 align:middle line:84%
They understood the
entangled nature of reality.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.870 align:middle line:84%
As an alchemist took any
materia, such as water,

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.130 align:middle line:84%
or an herb, or a mineral,
through the alchemical stages,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
they understood that
everything they did to it,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.400 align:middle line:84%
they were also
doing to themselves.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.680 align:middle line:84%
There is a strong affinity
between the alchemist

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
and the object of
their experiment.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And every process
it went through,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.130 align:middle line:84%
they didn't see themselves
as separate observers.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.520 align:middle line:10%
True alchemy is consistent with
quantum physics principles,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:10%
such as the observer
effect and entanglement.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.620 align:middle line:90%
We are all interconnected.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.950 align:middle line:84%
The operator, the
observer, matters.

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.760 align:middle line:84%
The observer and the observed
are entangled together.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to create the right
state of being inwardly.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts alone can spoil
the alchemical operations.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we must be of
pure mind and not

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.630 align:middle line:84%
allow emotions or attachments
to interfere with our work.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Then we must be able to
hold that coherence state,

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.340 align:middle line:84%
to have the right vibrational
field for transformation

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:84%
to take place regardless
of the tools we use.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:10%
The machine that Dr. Emoto used,
as well as other technologies,

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.950 align:middle line:10%
such as the Rife machine and
various radionics devices,

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.730 align:middle line:10%
can be effective when used
on generally healthy people

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:10%
to maintain homeostasis.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
They are capable of making minor
adjustments within a mostly

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.450 align:middle line:90%
balanced state.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
However, for someone who
is way out of balance,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.180 align:middle line:84%
and disease has already
set in the body,

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
most of these machines
are not operating

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:84%
at the level of
intensity and power

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
needed to shift the
vibration back into harmony.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
That's not to say
they can't get there.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.440 align:middle line:84%
But there are safety
laws and regulations

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that restrict such
use in many countries.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:10%
For example, it's
said that Nikola Tesla

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:10%
used his electric
current devices

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:10%
to treat people who
had various ailments.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.890 align:middle line:10%
But the intensity
of his devices had

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.770 align:middle line:10%
to be set to such a
high power, the people

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:10%
reported getting burned
from the strong electricity.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:90%
His treatments were effective.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.690 align:middle line:84%
But most people don't want
to get burned in the process.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
Thus, vibrational
devices used today

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
tend to operate
within the safe range.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:90%
They can still be helpful.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:84%
But the effects are
much more subtle

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:84%
and mostly good for maintaining
homeostasis, rather than

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:90%
treating acute disease.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
The body knows how to
self-heal when given

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:90%
the right input and energy.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:84%
But once the system gets
too far out of balance,

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
the cells become
confused or too toxic.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And the subtle energy
might not work,

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:84%
because the body's
program is too confused

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:90%
to respond in the right way.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.760 align:middle line:84%
What's more, the cause of
the disease or imbalance

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.070 align:middle line:84%
may be happening
at higher levels.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
These vibrational devices
use physical energy.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Thus, they can work
on physical levels.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
But when the root of the problem
is coming from higher planes,

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
such as mental,
emotional, or etheric,

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
we need higher vibrational
methods to heal the cause.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Thus, we need to treat
beyond the physical.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So how do we access
stronger methods of healing

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:90%
in a safe way?

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:84%
We've observed that
all healing requires

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:90%
a combination of factors.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
First, the healer
or practitioner

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:84%
must set the correct energy
flow by bringing their energy

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.840 align:middle line:90%
into a coherent state.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
The healer or practitioner
needs proper training

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.440 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do that and
to hold the coherent state

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.090 align:middle line:90%
for extended periods of time.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:84%
The second ingredient
needed is for the client

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:90%
to be willing to get better.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:84%
The recipient has to
be ready to say yes

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
to healing, to letting go of old
ways that are not serving them,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and to making the changes that
need to be made at all levels,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:84%
physically, emotionally,
mentally, and spiritually.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
We need to shift our behaviors
and lifestyle choices in order

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.210 align:middle line:90%
to sustain healing.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:84%
The third factor is
the tool that mediates

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.670 align:middle line:90%
between the healer and client.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
It has to be the
right kind of tool,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
a tool that delivers
the right kind of energy

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and holds a pure vibration.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.810 align:middle line:10%
Many shamanic tools were
used in ancient times, things

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.620 align:middle line:10%
like herbal remedies, smudging
with sage smoke, medicine

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:10%
totems, sacred items, shamanic
wands, and other tools

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.380 align:middle line:10%
made from nature.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.300 align:middle line:10%
And then there are
higher vibrational tools,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.630 align:middle line:10%
such as hermetic, alchemical,
and esoteric tools

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:10%
created over the millennia
by advanced mystery

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.110 align:middle line:10%
school initiates, such as
Leonardo da Vinci, Paracelsus,

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.250 align:middle line:10%
MacGregor Mathers,
Nikola Tesla, and others.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes a healer
may also choose

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
not to use any physical tool,
other than their own ability

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:84%
to flow energy through their
hands, voice, movements,

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and aura.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.790 align:middle line:84%
If the practitioner
is truly in touch

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and has higher
levels of training

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.570 align:middle line:84%
in how to properly work with
numbers, letters, and sounds,

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
they might use
holy words or words

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:44.360 align:middle line:84%
of power, chanted or toned
at the right frequencies

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and rhythm to deliver
powerful healing energy.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
If they have tuned their own
self to be a pure vessel,

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:84%
they can eliminate
the use of a tool

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
and bring divinity straight in.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
They can direct that
vibrational energy

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
straight into the client,
to awaken the divinity

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:84%
within the client, so that
the client can self-heal.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
But this direct method
only really works

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:84%
at full power,
when they can truly

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
hold that field of divinity,
from the awareness of I

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
am god, serving
another god or goddess.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
The energy they
bring through might

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.090 align:middle line:84%
feel subtle, but in this
case that is usually

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
because it is at
such a high vibration

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.880 align:middle line:84%
that it is beyond our
typical sensory range.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:84%
The energy conducted by a
well-trained healer-initiate

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
contains all levels
of the spectrum,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:90%
all the way from source.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.390 align:middle line:84%
This kind of energy
can help transmute

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.660 align:middle line:84%
and heal the root
cause of most issues

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
that reside in the mental
and emotional realms, when

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:84%
the recipient is
truly ready to heal.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:middle line:84%
When the root cause is healed,
then the body can heal.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.680 align:middle line:84%
A machine or device,
on the other hand,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:90%
mediates physical energy.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:84%
It comes through as either
electromagnetic or scalar

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.290 align:middle line:90%
waves.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's not pure source
energy because the machine

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.330 align:middle line:84%
itself doesn't have
the soul with which

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to bring through such
higher vibrational energies.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.490 align:middle line:84%
But it can deliver physical
energies that are already here

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
and serves to focus them or tune
into just the right vibrations

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
needed for restoring
physical homeostasis.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
We cannot take ourselves and
our own willingness to shift out

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.620 align:middle line:90%
of the equation.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people look to devices
or to healers and doctors

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
for a quick fix.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to change
anything in their life.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.250 align:middle line:84%
They just want the
symptoms to go away.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for someone
to take away the problem.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
taking responsibility.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.520 align:middle line:84%
No true healing can
happen this way.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:84%
We can't look for anything
outside of us to be our saviour

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:84%
or a magic bullet to
take away our problems.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We must be willing
to do the inner work,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to shift on the inner planes,
as the inner, so the outer.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.700 align:middle line:10%
Even if our physical
symptoms get resolved,

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.100 align:middle line:10%
if the higher planes
haven't been healed,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.870 align:middle line:10%
then we will inevitably
manifest the same issue again.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:24.730 align:middle line:84%
We must move toward accessing
a wider range of frequencies

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.960 align:middle line:84%
and at higher levels in order
to make that lasting shift

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.720 align:middle line:90%
within the inner plane.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.360 align:middle line:84%
What are some ways we
can access this wider

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.400 align:middle line:90%
range of frequencies?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:84%
As humans, we are comprised of
a huge range of frequencies,

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:90%
both physical and spiritual.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:84%
We are spirit, mind, soul,
ether, light, sound, emotion,

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:90%
materia, and more.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We are multidimensional and
multivibrational beings.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Since ancient times, one
method for vibrational healing

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.200 align:middle line:84%
that has been used around
the world and across cultures

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:90%
is sound healing.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The human auditory
system can perceive

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:90%
10 octaves of sound vibration.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
That is a large
bandwidth, 10 times larger

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:90%
than our visual capacity.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Medicine men and women
of ancient tribes

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:84%
learned to use
instruments as tools

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to vibrate the body of the
person who needed healing

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
into an altered state, hopefully
into a more harmonious state.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:84%
These sound healers needed to
be initiated and authorized

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
by the tribal lineage to use
the sacred instruments in such

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:90%
a way.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And these instruments
were created

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
in a very specific
and sacred way

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:45.640 align:middle line:84%
when they were intended to
be used for healing purposes.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It was not just about being
able to play good music.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.420 align:middle line:84%
The healer needed to be trained
as a conduit for spirit,

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.170 align:middle line:84%
so that they could deliver the
proper vibrations required.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.090 align:middle line:84%
They also needed to
be able to perceive

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.920 align:middle line:84%
the energies of
the body and soul

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:84%
of that unique individual
receiving healing.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.130 align:middle line:84%
They also needed to have
an intimate relationship

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
with the spirit of
the sacred instrument.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Rhythmic music and chants can
very quickly entrain the brain,

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
harmonizing the
hemispheres and shifting us

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.630 align:middle line:84%
into altered states
of consciousness,

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.180 align:middle line:90%
to receive at deeper levels.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Sound can also move and shape
matter on a molecular level.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.550 align:middle line:10%
This has been well demonstrated
since at least the 1960s

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.090 align:middle line:10%
and '70s, from the work of
Dr. Hans Jenny and those

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.260 align:middle line:10%
who have followed his research
in the field of cymatics.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was known to
the ancients as well.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:84%
After all, every spiritual
tradition around the world

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of creation
story that involves sound.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Different vibrational
energies work

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:90%
at different frequency ranges.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And these will interact with
matter in different scales.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
healing, we want

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
to reach homeostasis, which is
a state of balance and harmony,

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
with everything in
its proper rhythm,

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.160 align:middle line:84%
containing the right
amount of charge and so on.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:84%
This requires the use of a
wide range of frequencies.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Health is about balance at
all levels of the system.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.890 align:middle line:84%
So what does it take to
get into true healing,

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to find and maintain that
balance in body, mind,

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.650 align:middle line:90%
and soul?

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.460 align:middle line:84%
To achieve such balance,
we must treat the mind.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:35.120 align:middle line:84%
This is where most of our
problems really start.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Rather than treating
just the physical level,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.030 align:middle line:84%
we need to heal
our mind and soul.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
The Kabbalistic tree of life
gives us a blueprint for life

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and helps us to understand
how things manifest.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
It also gives us clues for
balancing and achieving

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:90%
true healing.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
The three-dimensional
tree has four pillars,

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.340 align:middle line:90%
known as the four watchtowers.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
These relate to our
immune system, the defense

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:90%
against disease and negativity.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.720 align:middle line:84%
This three-dimensional
tree is also our DNA.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The four pillars relate to the
four elements, earth, water,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.200 align:middle line:90%
air, and fire.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.270 align:middle line:84%
And as the tree rotates, it
cycles through the elements.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Each element has its own cycle.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.580 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
see this in water,

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:84%
as it cycles through the phases
of gas, and liquid, and solid.

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Each of the four
elements similarly

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.820 align:middle line:84%
goes through its own
phases and cycles.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
They're all cycling
on the planet,

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
constantly in motion,
each in a different way.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.650 align:middle line:90%
They all cycle.

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, we go through
phases and cycles.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:10%
In alchemy, there are four major
phases called Nigredo, Albedo,

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:10%
Citrinitas, and Rubedo.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Nigredo is the process
of decomposition

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and breaking down of impurities.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.050 align:middle line:84%
Albedo is about purification
and raising vibration.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:84%
Citrinitas is the transmutation
and enlightenment of the self.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:84%
While Rubedo is the ultimate
completion of the great work.

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
We are all meant to be
continuously cycling

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
through these
phases in our life.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:84%
Another issue we face
in bringing ourselves,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.640 align:middle line:84%
and our four pillars, and the
immune system in the balance

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is that most people are focused
solely on the earth's pillar

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.950 align:middle line:90%
and are unaware of the rest.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.400 align:middle line:84%
99% of our attention
tends to be on earth,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:90%
on the physicality of things.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
We are not taking into
account the other elements

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:90%
of our being.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, our
pillars aren't balanced.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Complete balancing
of the four pillars

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
would bring us to a place
of consciously using

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.020 align:middle line:84%
our full brain capacity
and DNA potential.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.140 align:middle line:84%
In today's world, most
people are not even

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.960 align:middle line:84%
using a fraction of
their tree of life.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.680 align:middle line:84%
We are only consciously aware
of the tip of the iceberg,

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.720 align:middle line:90%
of what is happening around us.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We only use maybe
5% to 10% of our DNA

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.170 align:middle line:84%
to actively code for the
proteins that build the body.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And we have huge
potential within us,

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that is dormant and
waiting to be activated.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.200 align:middle line:84%
In order to expand into
our full potential,

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.750 align:middle line:84%
we must come into balance
with all four pillars

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.480 align:middle line:84%
What are these four
pillars of our being?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, earth is
our physical life.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Water is emotion and intuition.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Air is mind and thoughts.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Fire is passion,
will, and purpose.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the center
of this structure

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:84%
is the middle pillar,
the seed of divinity

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:84%
and our direct
connection to source.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Our goal, when balancing these,
is to come into the middle,

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:84%
to live in the middle
pillar, with all four

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.740 align:middle line:90%
elements active and balanced.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:84%
This means both
being aware of them

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:84%
and living a lifestyle
that supports all of them

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.980 align:middle line:90%
in balance and good operation.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.640 align:middle line:84%
When we do this, we are
healthy, emotionally, mentally,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and physically, with a sense of
our true purpose and actively

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:84%
expressing our gifts
and creative spark.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And when we have all four
pillars active and balanced,

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.620 align:middle line:84%
then our immune
system will be strong.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:84%
We will live in the
middle pillar, connected

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:84%
to our divinity and accessing
limitless potential.

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.750 align:middle line:84%
If we could harness source
energy within our DNA,

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:42.530 align:middle line:84%
as the tree of life indicates,
and as alchemists of old agree,

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:84%
then we could be self-healing
and self-generating.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.090 align:middle line:84%
We could be consciously using
100% of our brain capacity,

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
such as depicted in
the movie "Lucy."

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.830 align:middle line:84%
We could gain
superhuman abilities

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.380 align:middle line:84%
as our brain
becomes more active,

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
abilities like telepathy,
telekinesis, clairvoyance,

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:90%
They would become commonplace.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could even
become, like Dr. Strange,

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.810 align:middle line:90%
harnessing time and space.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:14.210 align:middle line:84%
What is the key to accomplishing
such superhuman feats?

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Emoto's conclusion, after
all his studies and research,

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.790 align:middle line:84%
was that all things lie
within your own consciousness.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.570 align:middle line:84%
The concept of Hado corresponds
with what the alchemists have

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
known for thousands of years.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It is the core
essence of source,

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:84%
as it flows into our
physical atoms and DNA.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
This source vibration,
in the physical,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.290 align:middle line:90%
is within our own consciousness.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.070 align:middle line:84%
The key to healing and
wielding this vibration within

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:51.000 align:middle line:84%
is what the alchemists
referred to as the secret fire.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:84%
Modern-day alchemist
Dennis William Hauck

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.860 align:middle line:84%
says the alchemists
believed that the driving

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.740 align:middle line:84%
force behind the
evolution of matter,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:03.180 align:middle line:84%
the connection between mental
and physical reality, was fire.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.610 align:middle line:90%
But this is not typical fire.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.760 align:middle line:84%
The alchemists talked about
different grades or types

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.870 align:middle line:90%
of fire.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.720 align:middle line:84%
In particular, they
mentioned four types.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:10%
A Benedictine monk,
who practiced alchemy

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.170 align:middle line:10%
in the late 18th century, by the
name of Antoine-Joseph Pernety,

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:23.820 align:middle line:10%
called these four types
elementary fire, secret fire,

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.410 align:middle line:10%
central fire, and
celestial fire.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:32.340 align:middle line:84%
Elementary fire is the fire
we are all familiar with.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Secret fire is
higher consciousness.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Pernety said this heat is very
different within the generation

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.730 align:middle line:84%
of the individuals,
of the three kingdoms.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It sounds a lot like Dr.
Emoto's concept of Hado.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:84%
Then the central fire is
lodged in the center of matter.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.145 align:middle line:84%
It is tenacious and
innate in matter.

00:25:56.145 --> 00:25:58.650 align:middle line:90%
It engenders matter.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.530 align:middle line:84%
They called it God's
signature within matter.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the celestial
fire is the highest grade.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.810 align:middle line:84%
It is the pure power
of divine will,

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.970 align:middle line:84%
which connects to
material density

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.990 align:middle line:90%
through the central fire.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:90%
What does all this mean?

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:20.070 align:middle line:84%
In essence, alchemists sought
to harness the secret fire,

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.890 align:middle line:84%
that power of higher
consciousness,

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in order to access
the central fire

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.430 align:middle line:84%
or divine spark within
matter and draw it out.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:84%
They believed that
through this process,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:37.050 align:middle line:84%
they could transform matter into
its ultimate perfected state.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:41.640 align:middle line:84%
Paracelsus wrote, "Know, then,
that the ultimate and also

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.950 align:middle line:84%
the primal matter of
everything is fire.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:10%
This is the key that
locks the chest.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.180 align:middle line:10%
It is this which makes
manifest whatever

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.730 align:middle line:10%
is hidden in anything."

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.990 align:middle line:84%
This fire must operate
on the quantum level,

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.820 align:middle line:84%
within the zero point
field, the ether,

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.150 align:middle line:90%
or Akasha discussed elsewhere.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Pernety said it is specifically
the central fire, contained

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.970 align:middle line:84%
within the center of matter,
that produces or engenders

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:90%
matter.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the smallest
building block of matter.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And this building block is the
divine spark, the god seed,

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.390 align:middle line:84%
the core essence
from the source,

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.870 align:middle line:84%
as its will touches
the material realm.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.890 align:middle line:84%
This central fire is a
single unit or quantum

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:36.330 align:middle line:84%
of divine will, a particle
of god consciousness.

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.920 align:middle line:84%
This particle is smaller than
any other particle we know of,

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.610 align:middle line:84%
far smaller and of higher
energy than anything

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.070 align:middle line:84%
current technologies
can observe.

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:51.540 align:middle line:84%
It exists at the quantum
scale, near the Planck length,

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.230 align:middle line:84%
the bridge between the quantum
vacuum and the material realm,

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.800 align:middle line:84%
where consciousness
and matter unite.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.800 align:middle line:84%
On the tree of life, we
find this central fire

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.660 align:middle line:90%
within the middle pillar.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the central
core of any atom.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.430 align:middle line:84%
This particle of consciousness
is within the nuclei.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.090 align:middle line:84%
It acts as a portal through
which divine consciousness

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:90%
enters into manifestation.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It is the essence of
source within this world.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.390 align:middle line:84%
It has the seed of
divinity within it.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:29.700 align:middle line:84%
This seed is something that we,
as conscious and aware beings,

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:34.080 align:middle line:84%
can tap into by using our own
secret fire of consciousness

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.710 align:middle line:90%
to reach it.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:38.400 align:middle line:90%
This allows us to impact matter.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:84%
From a quantum
physics perspective,

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.510 align:middle line:84%
we might imagine
that our thoughts

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:84%
send particles of
consciousness toward whatever

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:90%
we are observing.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Those consciousness particles
shift the quantum state,

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.530 align:middle line:84%
causing the wave
function to collapse.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
This is the mechanism or
means by which we can direct

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:90%
consciousness to impact matter.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Because those
consciousness particles

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.000 align:middle line:84%
carry that pure
essence of source,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.010 align:middle line:84%
they are directed by will,
which directs the mind.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Think of will as a
force of creation

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that mediates and
directs consciousness.

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It is at this quantum level
that pure essence of source

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.010 align:middle line:84%
comes together with the pure
essence of physical density,

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.950 align:middle line:84%
thereby changing it
to a new vibration

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:32.190 align:middle line:90%
and shifting its state.

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
The shift happens when source
energy and physical density

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%
connect.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Through the unity of the
two, spiritual and physical,

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.072 align:middle line:90%
transformation can happen.

00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:44.970 align:middle line:90%
With just one, nothing happens.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.490 align:middle line:84%
It is through the
interaction and union

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.870 align:middle line:84%
of two different energies
that transformation happens.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:55.350 align:middle line:84%
Each brings in a
different frequency.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Energy from source is a
high vibration frequency.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It hit the physical,
which is governed

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.280 align:middle line:84%
by another frequency level,
the Fibonacci or golden ratio.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:84%
When these spiritual and
physical frequencies combine,

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.050 align:middle line:84%
they generate a different
frequency altogether.

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Our task is to
come into alignment

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:84%
with the middle pillar,
the core of the atom, where

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:84%
the fire of consciousness,
the seed of divinity resides.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.770 align:middle line:84%
When we do, it becomes a
quantum conscious event, that

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.400 align:middle line:90%
penetrates the entire being.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
It is a state of
pure bliss, where

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:90%
the mind is completely empty.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:84%
The world around feels
like it disappears.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And we are one with divinity,
embodied in the flesh.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.970 align:middle line:90%
Is such a thing possible?

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:46.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:10%
There are well-documented
cases in Tibetan Buddhism,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.190 align:middle line:10%
for example, of what they
call the great perfection

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:54.870 align:middle line:10%
or the rainbow body.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.270 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow body is
a transition state

00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.840 align:middle line:84%
of transcending the ephemeral
into the immortal body

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:90%
of light.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:84%
This is a phenomenon where
the masters, who have fully

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:09.150 align:middle line:84%
harnessed their consciousness
and will after many years

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.400 align:middle line:84%
of devotion to
their practices, are

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.750 align:middle line:84%
able to alchemically extract the
central fire from their atoms.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:19.470 align:middle line:84%
They draw this essence
together into one unified light

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:24.240 align:middle line:84%
body, while discarding any
final impurities that remain.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
As the central
fire is extracted,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.940 align:middle line:84%
the energy that holds the
space within the atoms

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and between the atoms
is also extracted.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And that space between
things collapses.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.700 align:middle line:84%
All that remains is
a small pile of dust,

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.340 align:middle line:84%
and maybe hair,
teeth, and nails,

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.120 align:middle line:84%
depending on the level of
attainment of that master.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:84%
As the spirit and soul are
released with the light body,

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:53.160 align:middle line:84%
observers report seeing
rainbows of light.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalistically, the rainbow
represents the full integration

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
of all the Sefirot
on the tree of life,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.990 align:middle line:84%
each emanating a different
color of the spectrum.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Only by being aware of ourselves
as spirit, which is infinite,

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.470 align:middle line:90%
can we do this.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Only through understanding
numbers, frequency, rhythms,

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:19.200 align:middle line:84%
sounds, words of power,
proper use of sacred geometry,

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and Hado can we do this.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
These are the fundamentals that
govern our ability to interact,

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:90%
this level of reality.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Beyond having knowledge
of the concepts,

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.010 align:middle line:84%
we must also understand how
to use them and put them

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:84%
into practice, so that we
become masterful at using them.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
That practice involves things
like hermetic applications,

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
Kabbalah, martial arts, ritual
mastery, prayer, meditation,

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:56.060 align:middle line:84%
service, but also poetry,
art, dance, passion, love,

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.680 align:middle line:90%
and joy in life.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
This is about the way
we live life every day.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a way of life.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The only way to
reach that state is

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:12.400 align:middle line:84%
by not having a comfort
zone, constantly

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.820 align:middle line:84%
pushing the edge of
progression to the next level.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.530 align:middle line:84%
When we get too comfortable, we
get complacent and we stagnate.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.590 align:middle line:84%
When we're not progressing,
we're regressing.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.750 align:middle line:90%
There is no standing still.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.090 align:middle line:84%
Thus, on a true
path to mastery, we

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.730 align:middle line:84%
are always pushing
our progression,

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:34.460 align:middle line:84%
getting out of the comfort
zone, to take that next step.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Then integrate,
meaning implement,

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:84%
so that we can become
proficient with that new skill

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.380 align:middle line:84%
or practice, and then
continuing to step forward

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.970 align:middle line:90%
to the next level.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.330 align:middle line:84%
We can harness these
energies from the inside out.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.390 align:middle line:90%
We can harness the secret fire.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.350 align:middle line:90%


00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Join me again, as we explore
the realms of consciousness

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.110 align:middle line:90%
beyond the hologram.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring the mysteries

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:08.950 align:middle line:84%
of the universe with me in this
episode of "Mystery Teachings."

00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:11.700 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.502 align:middle line:90%
