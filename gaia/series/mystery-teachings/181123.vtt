00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.477 align:middle line:90%

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard, and
this is "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:10%
What is the secret to accessing
our quantum potential?

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.860 align:middle line:10%
Is this even possible?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.140 align:middle line:10%
Let's enter the quantum
gap and discover

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:10%
the infinite potential contained
within the zero-point field.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.090 align:middle line:90%
What does quantum really mean?

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:90%
What is the key to all this?

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
gap or the space between.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.110 align:middle line:84%
We are told that quantum
fields are everywhere.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we can observe,
like particles and waves

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.890 align:middle line:84%
of energy, are excitations
on a background field.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
But just like the vibrations
on a guitar string,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.040 align:middle line:84%
there are only certain
allowed intervals

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
for how many wavelengths
it can fit on that string.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:84%
This is what is
called quantized.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.810 align:middle line:84%
When something is quantized,
its events and properties

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
are discrete rather
than continuous.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
There are allowed states
and disallowed states.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
A basic binary is the
simplest expression of this,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:90%
like a light switch--

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.490 align:middle line:90%
on, off, one, zero.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking of
a line as continuous,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:84%
we can imagine it as a
discrete set of points

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.280 align:middle line:84%
spaced really close together
with tiny gaps in between.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, in an atom when the
electrons leap between orbits,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
it passes through
the quantum gap.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It's in one state, then it
seems to disappear and then

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.770 align:middle line:90%
reappear in another orbit.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:90%
Where does it go in between?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.530 align:middle line:84%
There are only certain
allowed states or orbitals

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.080 align:middle line:84%
where the electron
can be found, much

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:84%
like the number of allowed
vibrations on the guitar

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:90%
string.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
The space between those
is called forbidden,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.570 align:middle line:84%
but it is in that forbidden
zone that all possibilities

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:90%
are held.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.510 align:middle line:84%
The space between where
the gap is the key,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
shifting into quantum
awareness becomes possible

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:90%
when we focus on the gap.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.350 align:middle line:84%
The quantum gap is more
fundamental than the particles

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
or events, or the many
manifold expressions.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.660 align:middle line:84%
The gap is like the blank
canvas or empty space

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.160 align:middle line:84%
upon which all objects
are painted or observed.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
This is similar to the shift Neo
made in "The Matrix" movie when

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
he starts being able
to see everything

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
as a string of binary code of
ones in green light and zeros

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.390 align:middle line:84%
in black, instead
of seeing people,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.150 align:middle line:84%
buildings, et cetera, as
solid, real things that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:90%
impose limitations.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to the
quantum leap of an electron

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.270 align:middle line:90%
for further insight.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.540 align:middle line:84%
When an electron jumps to
a higher orbital state,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.260 align:middle line:84%
a certain amount of energy
is needed to excite it.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
For example, perhaps a
photon of ultraviolet light

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.940 align:middle line:84%
strikes an electron and causes
it to leap to a higher energy

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.110 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
In that higher energy state,
it has more potential energy,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.730 align:middle line:84%
and it's further away
from the nucleus.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.820 align:middle line:84%
We could say that
the atom expanded.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.960 align:middle line:84%
It now has more
empty space inside.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.460 align:middle line:84%
This empty space is very
important, even more so

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.900 align:middle line:90%
than the particles.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
If we were to take away the
empty space in our atoms,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
then our entire body would
fit on the tip of a needle.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.910 align:middle line:84%
Yet, this empty space
is not empty at all.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:84%
It's teeming with
huge potential energy.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It holds the quantum sea
of infinite possibilities.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Most of us by now have heard
of the zero-point field

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:90%
or the quantum vacuum.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.079 align:middle line:90%
But what really is it?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:84%
If we take a small volume of
empty space, remove all matter,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
and even bring it to
absolute zero temperature,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:84%
classical physics would say
it should have zero energy.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
But quantum physics gives us an
entirely different situation.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that the
vacuum would still

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.370 align:middle line:84%
be filled with quantum fields
in their lowest energy or ground

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.510 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And due to the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:84%
there must be fluctuations
in these fields giving

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.890 align:middle line:90%
a non-zero energy.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
The result is that
so-called empty space

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:84%
is a dynamic, boiling
sea of virtual particles

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.160 align:middle line:90%
and immense energy.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
One easy way to
visualize this is

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.290 align:middle line:90%
to imagine an atomic pendulum.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:84%
If the pendulum is resting and
at its lowest point of zero

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
height, classical
physics would say

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
it has zero kinetic and
zero potential energy.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics, however, says
there must be a slight wobble

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.590 align:middle line:84%
due to the uncertainty principle
because we cannot know both

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
the exact position and
momentum at the same time.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
This is called
zero-point motion.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And this supports the ancient
hermetic principle of vibration

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.650 align:middle line:90%
that says nothing rests.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.760 align:middle line:90%
Everything moves.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything vibrates.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:84%
As a result of this motion,
there is a non-zero ground

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.650 align:middle line:90%
state energy.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Physicist David
Bohm once calculated

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
the potential zero-point
energy of the vacuum.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.700 align:middle line:84%
To do so, he assumed that
the smallest wavelength

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:84%
a field excitation
could have is what's

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.690 align:middle line:84%
called the Planck length,
which is just extremely tiny.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And the largest could be the
size of the cosmos itself.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Bohm calculated that
in one cubic centimeter

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:84%
of empty space, the
amount of energy

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
would be far beyond the total
energy of all the matter

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:middle line:90%
in the known universe.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the amount of
visible matter in the universe

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:84%
only amounts to about
5% of its composition,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.250 align:middle line:84%
while 27% is composed
of dark matter, which

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
is some unknown kinds of
particles yet to be discovered.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And the remaining
68% is mysteriously

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
called dark energy,
which is actually

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.185 align:middle line:84%
most likely due to the intrinsic
energy of the vacuum itself.

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.310 align:middle line:84%
There is much debate as to
whether this zero-point energy

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:84%
could ever be harnessed
for technological purposes,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.680 align:middle line:84%
but we do know that it is
a physically real energy.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.010 align:middle line:84%
Many engineers and
scientists are actively

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:84%
investigating
whether this energy

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.510 align:middle line:84%
can be tapped for
new energy technology

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.350 align:middle line:90%
and rapid spaceflight.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.920 align:middle line:84%
But the modern day
concept of the vacuum

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is no longer one of
emptiness, but a fullness.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a plenum.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It is a seething ocean of
dynamic quantum field activity.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Science has come
full circle back

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.470 align:middle line:84%
to the ancient concept of
the ether or quintessence

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemists.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
They're even using these terms
again, which is fascinating.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:84%
It's currently
proposed to be a scalar

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.090 align:middle line:84%
field with an overall negative
pressure or anti-gravity force.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.440 align:middle line:84%
Simply that this
energy of the vacuum

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.860 align:middle line:84%
is what causes the
universe to expand.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Some physicists are
now calling this

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.470 align:middle line:84%
the fifth fundamental
force in the universe.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.360 align:middle line:84%
In metaphysics, we
would more likely

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:84%
call this the first
force, the prima,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:11.310 align:middle line:84%
which is what initiated the
Big Bang in the first place.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
How can we understand
this zero-point field,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
this quintessence, which is so
far beyond our ordinary ability

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to perceive?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:84%
To get a feel for
it, let's return

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:90%
to the metaphor of the ocean.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:31.290 align:middle line:84%
To begin with, imagine the ocean
is quiet and completely still.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:84%
Its surface is as
smooth as glass.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:90%
This is the ground state.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Then from the depths,
something bubbles up

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and breaks through
to the surface,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:90%
creating a disturbance.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
The water will oscillate,
sending ripples or waves.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.660 align:middle line:84%
This is what is called
a quantum excitation

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:90%
or fluctuation of the field.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Such an excitation
corresponds to a particle wave

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.490 align:middle line:90%
of matter or force.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:10%
Philosopher of
science Ervin Laszlo

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:10%
gave a great analogy that
serves very well here.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.600 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that each
type of particle

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:10%
is like a different
kind of boat.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Some are big and slow
like cruise ships.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Others are fast and
powerful like speed boats.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And so others are lightweight
and have minimal trace.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Each different type of boat
creates a different type

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
of wake as it travels
through the water.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.480 align:middle line:84%
The waves that spread
out from the wake

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.400 align:middle line:84%
carry certain information about
the size, speed, and location

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:90%
of the boat.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And as these waves
spread out, they

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:45.290 align:middle line:84%
influence all other
boats traveling nearby.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
The busier the
ocean, the more waves

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that combine and interfere,
the more the water

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
becomes modulated by
these wave patterns.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:84%
And thus, it carries more
information or memory

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:90%
of all its activities.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but the
waves also influence what

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:90%
is swimming beneath the surface.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
These waves inform others of
the presence of that boat,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:84%
as well as influence
their motion.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Even when the boat is
long gone, the waves

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.210 align:middle line:84%
can still be seen and felt
like a memory of the boat that

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:90%
passed through.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine that this
wave memory lasts forever

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.770 align:middle line:84%
in the infinite quantum sea
of the zero-point field.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.880 align:middle line:84%
We're going to add one slight
modification to this picture.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Quantum particles not
only move through space,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:84%
they also have a property
called spin that interacts

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.760 align:middle line:90%
with the vacuum.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So beyond the typical wave field
that they leave in their wake,

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:56.000 align:middle line:84%
they also create vortices
or rotating wave packets.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
These were named torsion
fields by Russian physicists.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
As the various wave and
torsion fields intersect,

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:84%
they form the
interference patterns

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.890 align:middle line:84%
that are needed to encode
the hologram introduced

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.810 align:middle line:90%
in another episode.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
This holographic information
is encoded on the surface

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.470 align:middle line:90%
of the quantum sea.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
And as with all holograms,
the information is non-local.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.655 align:middle line:84%
It is distributed
throughout the whole.

00:11:25.655 --> 00:11:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:84%
In the quantum vacuum, waves
propagate quasi-instantly,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.590 align:middle line:84%
linking, informing, and
connecting all things.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the most plausible
reason for entanglement

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.330 align:middle line:84%
and the coherence found at so
many levels of our universe.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It is in this way that
the quantum vacuum carries

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and stores information about
all things and activities,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
from the tiniest of subatomic
particles to the cells

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:84%
of our body, to entire organisms
and even the cosmos itself.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:84%
There is no limit to
the information that can

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:90%
be conserved within this field.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
As Laszlo puts it,
"Thanks to information

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.320 align:middle line:84%
conserved and conveyed
by this field,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
the universe is of
mind-boggling coherence.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:90%
All things are connected."

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Let's pause here for a moment.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.040 align:middle line:84%
How can we relate
this to our lives?

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
What does all of
this mean for us?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.770 align:middle line:84%
First of all, can you access
your ground state or zero point

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.860 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
quiet, for example,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.920 align:middle line:84%
by finding peace and
stillness through a practice

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.660 align:middle line:90%
of meditation?

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Or are you in constant activity?

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
Finding our zero
point is essential

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:57.910 align:middle line:84%
if we want to have a meaningful
influence on the quantum realm.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, much
of what we do just

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:84%
creates more noise, which
results in more randomness.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Secondly, what excites you?

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:90%
What disturbs you?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Are the stimuli that you
expose your quantum field

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.500 align:middle line:84%
to elevating you in a
good way, or are they

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.175 align:middle line:84%
bringing in chaotic vibrations
that simply disturb the peace?

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:26.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Third, is your influence
on the quantum sea stormy,

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:90%
or is it well modulated?

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
How conscious and
intentional are you

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:90%
of this process in your life?

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but remember,
the field is connected.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:84%
So when we disturb or
excite the quantum sea,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:84%
what ripples are we
sending out to the rest

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:90%
of the connected universe?

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember also that the
quantum realm is not

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.820 align:middle line:84%
only influenced by our actions,
but by our consciousness

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the biggest
question is, how might you

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:84%
live your life
differently if you

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:10.280 align:middle line:84%
knew that every thought,
word, and action was

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.710 align:middle line:84%
being recorded and
sending ripples

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:90%
throughout the universe?

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.120 align:middle line:84%
These are all important
things to consider

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
if we want to harness
our quantum potential.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
In today's standard
model of physics,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.600 align:middle line:84%
they talk about fermions,
which are particles of matter,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:84%
and bosons, which are
force carriers that

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.540 align:middle line:90%
emerge from the quantum vacuum.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Now while the
terminologies vary,

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:38.000 align:middle line:84%
the core concepts are
all the same, the only

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
difference being that in the
ancient wisdom teachings,

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.540 align:middle line:84%
this field is not only the
source of all physical forms

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:84%
and forces, but also all
mind or consciousness, which

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.450 align:middle line:90%
is eternal.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.570 align:middle line:84%
This universal consciousness
holds all memory

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:90%
and directs the creative forces.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:10%
In the early 1900s, Nikola
Tesla wrote an editorial article

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:10%
called "Man's
Greatest Achievement."

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.350 align:middle line:10%
In it, he mentions this
field with its prana

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:10%
or creative force acting
upon akasha or ether,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:10%
and setting it into
tiny, spinning vortices

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.070 align:middle line:10%
to become matter.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Then as the forces
subside, matter

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:90%
disappears back into the field.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Tesla, always the
visionary, asks,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.690 align:middle line:84%
"Can man control this
greatest, most awe-inspiring

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:90%
of all processes in nature?

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.570 align:middle line:10%
If he could do this, he
would have powers almost

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:10%
unlimited and supernatural.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:10%
He could express all the
creations of his mind

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:45.560 align:middle line:10%
on any scale, in forms
concrete and imperishable."

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Can we harness
this quantum field?

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
Most traditional
scientists would tell you

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.960 align:middle line:84%
there is no way to tap into the
energy of the quantum vacuum

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
or zero-point field, but
that is because they are only

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.940 align:middle line:84%
considering things from the
materialistic perspective.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.750 align:middle line:84%
They calculate that we need
to put an incredible amount

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
of physical energy in to get the
same amount of energy back out.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So to them, it's a zero-sum
effort not worth the expense.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
This argument, though,
is based on treating

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.040 align:middle line:84%
the universe as a
closed system, and it

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
ignores the energy that can
be generated and directed

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:90%
by consciousness.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:84%
In metaphysics, we say
consciousness or awareness

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:90%
is primary.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
That first hermetic principle
says the all is mind.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.660 align:middle line:90%
The universe is mental.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.350 align:middle line:84%
But here, mind means
universal consciousness

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:90%
or unity consciousness.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
If we can train
our mind to achieve

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.900 align:middle line:84%
a coherent state of
unity consciousness,

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
then we can tap
the quantum field.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:84%
At a practical level,
how do we do this?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Getting into the
quantum space is an art.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.859 align:middle line:84%
It is the art of becoming
quantum conscious.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:84%
It takes repetition and
training ourselves to access it.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But once we do and we
anchor the feeling of it,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.069 align:middle line:84%
then it gets easier
and easier to access.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
Now, short of being a yogi
who meditates in a cave 12

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.599 align:middle line:84%
hours a day for 20
plus years, what can

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:84%
we do to harness this art
and reprogram ourselves?

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, there
are some keys that

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:90%
can help us transform faster.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
These are keys that
can be integrated

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
into daily life in the moments
between our activities.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
First, we must find our zero
point, a state of emptiness.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Only then will we
be able to access

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:84%
the fullness or the infinite
potential of the quantum field.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:59.180 align:middle line:84%
This zero point or ground
state is one of coherence.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.730 align:middle line:84%
There are three keys
taught by mystery schools

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:90%
for achieving such a state.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:09.530 align:middle line:84%
The first key is to realize
that there is only now.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.350 align:middle line:84%
The second key is
through stillness.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Relax the body and
quiet the mind.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Bring our entire being to
become like a quiet pond,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.760 align:middle line:84%
where the waters are
so still they perfectly

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:90%
reflect light like a mirror.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Use your will to bring
the waters to stillness.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.250 align:middle line:90%
The third key is focus.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.770 align:middle line:90%
What you focus on expands.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.520 align:middle line:84%
So focus on the gap,
and the gap will expand.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.710 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the gap is the
space between quantum states.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Focus on that space between.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Visually look at the
space between objects

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.620 align:middle line:84%
or the space between
you and I. Listen

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to the pause or
silence between sounds.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Tune in to the silence.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Kinesthetically feel
and expand the space

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:18.670 align:middle line:84%
in between breaths in,
out, fullness, emptiness.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:23.220 align:middle line:84%
This is the creative
breath of source.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.850 align:middle line:84%
In that space between
is infinite possibility.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:34.090 align:middle line:84%
What do you desire to experience
or manifest out of that space?

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Once we tap into the gap, how
do we then access its potential

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and intentionally direct
what manifests out?

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Is there a way to master
the quantum observer effect

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and truly direct the
course of reality?

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It is well established
by now that observation

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.670 align:middle line:84%
plays an integral
role in physics,

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
one that triggers something
to manifest out of the plenum.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Better known as the
observer effect in physics,

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
they call it the
measurement problem.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's a problem to
traditional scientists

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
because it says that our
universe is participatory.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
What we observe is
determined by how

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:22.230 align:middle line:84%
we set up the experiment or
the way we choose to observe.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
It means that consciousness
influences what information

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:90%
emerges from the quantum sea.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Our method of
observation preselects

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:40.620 align:middle line:84%
or predetermines what options
become available to us.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a lot like
saying our perspective

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
creates a bias, which then
determines our reality.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
It also means that consciousness
is an essential ingredient

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.790 align:middle line:90%
of our universe.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Nothing comes into being
without our involvement.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Now materialists still
argue this point.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:84%
They claim that a machine can
make an observation independent

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.380 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.820 align:middle line:84%
But as we'll see shortly,
this argument doesn't hold up.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
At some point, a
conscious observer

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.240 align:middle line:84%
must become aware
of that information.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:84%
How is this observer
effect discovered?

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, it relates to
wave particle duality.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Scientists have long
sought to understand

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:90%
the nature of light and matter.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Are they waves or particles?

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.810 align:middle line:84%
By the 1800s, light was known
to be waves, while matter

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.000 align:middle line:90%
was thought of as particles.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.920 align:middle line:84%
But various
experimental evidence

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:44.160 align:middle line:84%
started mounting up in
the early 1900s that

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.170 align:middle line:84%
suggested light might also act
as particles called photons

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and that matter might
also act as waves.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Science became confronted
with a mystery or paradox.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:84%
How can they be both
wave and particle?

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.420 align:middle line:84%
The paradigm at the time
said it must be either

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:90%
or, not both and.

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.040 align:middle line:84%
To solve this
mystery, scientists

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.370 align:middle line:84%
perform the famous
double-slit experiments.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Briefly, a beam
of light or matter

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
shines through a plate
with two small slits in it.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
Whatever passes through the
two slits then continues

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.210 align:middle line:84%
on to a screen behind
it for observation.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
In typical wave-like
behavior, the wave

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.850 align:middle line:84%
passes through both
slits and then forms

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:90%
two waves on the other side.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:84%
And these two waves
intersect each other,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.680 align:middle line:84%
combining constructively
and destructively.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
When they hit the
screen, it then

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.150 align:middle line:84%
reveals what's called
an interference pattern

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
with several bright
and dark bands.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.610 align:middle line:84%
But in typical
particle behavior,

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:51.090 align:middle line:84%
the particles pass through
one slit or the other.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:84%
What perplexed scientists
was that if they set up

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:58.830 align:middle line:84%
the experiment to see if either
light or matter is a wave,

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:02.370 align:middle line:84%
then indeed they get
wave-like behavior.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.520 align:middle line:84%
But if they place
detectors on the two slits

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:84%
to try to observe which slit
the electrons or photons are

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:14.610 align:middle line:84%
going through, then the results
change to particle behavior.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:90%
How can it be both?

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:90%
What does this all mean?

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.340 align:middle line:84%
These experiments confirm that
both light and matter are forms

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
of energy, and that energy can
behave as waves or particles

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.170 align:middle line:84%
depending on the
conditions we give it.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:35.190 align:middle line:84%
It's all about how we choose
to set up our observations

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:90%
or measurements.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
The very act of observing
has a dramatic effect

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:90%
on the behavior.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:46.200 align:middle line:84%
It's as if the quanta are aware
that they are being observed.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Or we might say that our
choice informs the quantum

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:84%
vacuum, which then responds
intelligently and gives us

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:90%
what we asked for.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:84%
This relates to the
spiritual teaching of ask

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and you shall receive.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.810 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalistic tradition,
the word "Kabbalah"

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:90%
means to receive.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.700 align:middle line:84%
The practice involves
asking questions

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
and receiving answers.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the question
and how it's phrased,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.590 align:middle line:84%
it shapes a kind of
vessel or container.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So long as that question
remains unanswered,

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.800 align:middle line:90%
the vessel is empty.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And like the quantum
gap, the empty vessel

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.330 align:middle line:90%
holds infinite possibilities.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:84%
As we continue to hold
our focus on the question,

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.060 align:middle line:84%
it's like conducting
an experiment

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.580 align:middle line:90%
and observing what comes.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, source
energy flows in

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:42.600 align:middle line:84%
to fill the vessel,
revealing an answer.

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:84%
Many questions have
more than one answer,

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:47.730 align:middle line:90%
depending on perspective.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Different questions set
up different containers

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:55.180 align:middle line:84%
or experiments, thus revealing
different types of answers.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:58.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, we could
ask, where am I?

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Or we could ask,
where am I going?

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.470 align:middle line:90%
One question is about right now.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:90%
The other is about the future.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.530 align:middle line:84%
They can reveal
different answers just

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
by a slight alteration
of the question.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Part of being a good Kabbalist,
as well as a scientist,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is about learning to
ask the right questions.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.500 align:middle line:84%
The crux of the
observer effect is

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that the observer sets
the context and conditions

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.860 align:middle line:90%
for how energy will behave.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.100 align:middle line:84%
As observers, we give
context or meaning

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.960 align:middle line:84%
to situations based on our
assumptions, expectations,

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:90%
and perspectives.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Believing is seeing, not
the other way around.

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Through our participation and
belief in what is possible,

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.360 align:middle line:84%
we establish what
options can emerge.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Does this mean that what we
call physical reality is created

00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:84%
by observation, or is our world
physically real independent

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.550 align:middle line:90%
of us?

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.400 align:middle line:84%
If it is created by
observation, does it

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
need to be conscious observation
or can it be any observation

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.350 align:middle line:84%
regardless of awareness,
such as by a machine?

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.250 align:middle line:10%
A physicist and mathematician,
John Von Neumann,

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:10%
deeply addressed this
measurement problem

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:10%
in his 1932 book on
quantum mechanics.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.770 align:middle line:84%
He showed that any part
of a physical system

00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
could be treated as a
chain of quantum objects

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.920 align:middle line:90%
that become entangled together.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
This includes all measuring
devices or machines, even up

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:90%
to the whole physical universe.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And this entire chain
of physical objects

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.840 align:middle line:84%
would join a quantum
system of super positions,

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:50.190 align:middle line:84%
becoming a part of a
universal wave function.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:54.960 align:middle line:84%
The whole system would remain
in that quantum superposition

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.110 align:middle line:90%
until it is observed.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Only something outside
of the calculation

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.600 align:middle line:90%
can collapse the wave function.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So Von Neumann concluded
that this something

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:12.220 align:middle line:84%
must be consciousness because
it goes beyond the physical.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.150 align:middle line:90%
So what does this tell us?

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:16.780 align:middle line:84%
It tells us that a
well-trained mind

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is able to directly
observe the quantum field

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and to get it to
materialize something out.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:84%
If consciousness is so
central to causing things

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.220 align:middle line:84%
to manifest out of
the quantum vacuum,

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.460 align:middle line:84%
then how might it have been
involved in the beginning

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.620 align:middle line:90%
of our universe?

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.040 align:middle line:84%
The universe is more
than just participatory.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It relies on conscious observers
to manifest physicality.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a pretty
loaded statement,

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and it will take
some time for science

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.220 align:middle line:90%
to catch up on this wisdom.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.120 align:middle line:84%
First, scientists need to
accept the fundamental existence

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is at the
foundation of the universe.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Then matter is a result
of mind or spirit.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we accomplish
this mastery of mind?

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.890 align:middle line:84%
How do we harness
our consciousness

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.890 align:middle line:84%
in order to have greater
influence on the quantum field?

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.210 align:middle line:84%
This is where some kind
of self-mastery practice

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.370 align:middle line:90%
and training comes in.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Both ancient traditions and
modern parapsychology studies

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:90%
agree on some basic steps.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.040 align:middle line:90%
First, we must relax the body.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.040 align:middle line:84%
This usually involves
slowing down brainwaves,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.550 align:middle line:84%
using some combination
of visualization, focused

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:40.550 align:middle line:84%
breathing, or other
meditation techniques.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.880 align:middle line:90%
Second is to quiet the mind.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
getting into our ground

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
state, that key of stillness,
especially inner stillness,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.440 align:middle line:84%
helping us access that
quantum gap for what

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.170 align:middle line:90%
we may call the void.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.860 align:middle line:84%
This stillness is the
background for all movement.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Tune into the stillness
of the quantum gap.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Become like a quiet pond.

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember also that this is
the ether or quintessence

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.080 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemists.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.270 align:middle line:90%
The third step is focus.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.210 align:middle line:84%
We must be of clear
intent, and we

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
have to be able to harness
and direct our will.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.400 align:middle line:84%
Alchemists of
different traditions

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.090 align:middle line:84%
have created many methods for
how to harness will or life

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.590 align:middle line:90%
force essence.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.980 align:middle line:84%
And common to them all
is developing a practice

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.360 align:middle line:84%
that strengthens the qualities
of discipline, patience,

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:84%
concentration, and holding
focus for long durations.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.510 align:middle line:84%
The fourth step
involves a combination

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.060 align:middle line:90%
of belief and desire.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.390 align:middle line:84%
One set of guidelines on
how to work real magic

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:52.270 align:middle line:84%
says we must bring about
a successful combination

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.150 align:middle line:84%
of intense desire
and concentration

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:57.040 align:middle line:90%
with an appropriate object.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.280 align:middle line:84%
This intense desire
can also be considered

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:90%
as a resonant or coherent state.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.580 align:middle line:84%
This step is a
process of waiting

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.410 align:middle line:84%
with excitement, belief, and
openness to the possibilities.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.450 align:middle line:10%
When it comes to
the quantum realm,

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.210 align:middle line:10%
we must learn to
hold an awareness

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.890 align:middle line:10%
of many simultaneous
possibilities.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Before we go into
the final step,

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:28.120 align:middle line:84%
let's go a bit deeper into how
we hold this quantum awareness.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:84%
As a simple example, take
the old optical illusion.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it a chalice or two faces?

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It's both, depending on how
we choose to look at it.

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:45.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, which is the particle view,
and which is the wave view?

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:50.080 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of a trick question
because both views are particle

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:90%
or object-oriented views.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Both have definite forms.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:59.440 align:middle line:84%
The wave or field view
would be more gestalt.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.245 align:middle line:84%
If we look beyond
the box and take

00:31:02.245 --> 00:31:07.400 align:middle line:84%
in the whole image at once,
we can get a feel for this.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Another thing we
must realize when

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.840 align:middle line:84%
it comes to the observer effect
is that it involves sacrifice.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
Recall the quantum
principles of complementarity

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.640 align:middle line:90%
and uncertainty.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The more precisely we identify
some observable state, the more

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.800 align:middle line:84%
we lock in that state
and therefore eliminate

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:84%
the other observables
or possibilities that

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.190 align:middle line:84%
could have been, this
is what physicists call

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.450 align:middle line:90%
collapsing the wave function.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:84%
One way to imagine this is
to think of a house of cards.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We see there are many
possibilities in there.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.630 align:middle line:84%
We may or may not know
what they all are.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.070 align:middle line:84%
When we make a measurement,
it's like pulling a card out.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:54.490 align:middle line:84%
This disrupts the field
and leads to a collapse

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:56.620 align:middle line:90%
of the whole house of cards.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.800 align:middle line:84%
We get something out,
but at the expense

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.520 align:middle line:84%
of sending all those
other possibilities away.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Given that, the
question arises, can we

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
select which
possibility comes out?

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Can we control this?

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Can we choose the specific
card of our desire?

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Or will it be random, subject
only to quantum uncertainty

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.170 align:middle line:90%
and nature's selection?

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Traditional science would
say that it's random.

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Due to the
uncertainty principle,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:31.410 align:middle line:84%
we can't control
what state comes out.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But ancient
initiatory traditions

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.660 align:middle line:84%
say there is a way
to direct this.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.450 align:middle line:84%
It requires training
and mastery of the mind.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It might not be easy,
but it is possible.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's worth the effort
to gain this skill.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Because when we do,
the possibilities

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.980 align:middle line:84%
for what we can
accomplish are limitless.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.090 align:middle line:84%
There is also research
that supports this claim.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.450 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness has been
shown capable of shifting

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:06.070 align:middle line:84%
random physical systems
away from randomness.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Random number generators or
RNGs are electronic devices

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that use quantum
phenomenon such as electron

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:18.310 align:middle line:84%
tunneling as a means of
generating randomness.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Studies with these
devices have consistently

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.920 align:middle line:84%
shown that when a
state of resonance

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:84%
occurs within the field,
whether by an individual

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.690 align:middle line:84%
or a collective, it causes
the random number generator

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:35.110 align:middle line:90%
to shift away from randomness.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:90%
What's meant by resonance here?

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a feeling of at
oneness, total absorption

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:90%
into unity consciousness.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:84%
When we can bring ourselves to
that state of consciousness,

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:50.500 align:middle line:84%
transcending the
illusion of separation,

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that is when our ability
to manifest our desires

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.380 align:middle line:90%
improves significantly.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.630 align:middle line:84%
If we can truly
direct the outcome,

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.780 align:middle line:84%
then the next
question is, how do we

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:04.870 align:middle line:90%
know what the best option is?

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.960 align:middle line:84%
How do we really master
this observer effect

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.360 align:middle line:90%
to get what we desire?

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:14.800 align:middle line:84%
This final step has
to do with intuition.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:19.360 align:middle line:84%
Only our intuition, ESP
or spiritual senses,

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.010 align:middle line:84%
can peer beyond the
hologram into true reality.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, this is
something we can all

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.630 align:middle line:90%
develop through practice.

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:84%
When our intuition is
strong and we trust it,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
that is when we become
good at selecting the best

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.449 align:middle line:90%
possibilities.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:41.199 align:middle line:84%
Thus far, we've spent a lot of
time talking about the mind,

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:84%
but this final step is one that
must be felt from the heart.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.900 align:middle line:84%
It involves setting ego and
attachments aside, surrendering

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:54.520 align:middle line:84%
to higher wisdom and waiting
for that heart-centered feelings

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:84%
of conviction, knowingness,
joy, and certainty to guide us.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Once that knowingness
comes in with clarity,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:07.370 align:middle line:84%
see it manifesting as
if it's already done.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.610 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.
