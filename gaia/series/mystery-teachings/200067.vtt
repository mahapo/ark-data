00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard,
and this is Mystery Teachings.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:10%
How do we get through those
difficult times in life

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:10%
when we find ourselves in
a dark night of the soul?

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:84%
How do we break through
to find the light again?

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, let's
explore these questions

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.630 align:middle line:84%
and discover ways to navigate
this most challenging part

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:90%
of the alchemical process.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
As a collective, we're in
the midst of a great shift

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:90%
in human consciousness.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And our current
stage in this process

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.980 align:middle line:84%
seems to be a dark
night of the soul.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.170 align:middle line:84%
If we want a breakthrough to our
greater potential and purpose,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.670 align:middle line:84%
there's really no way of
avoiding this dark night.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the alchemy.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.088 align:middle line:84%
So what is the dark
night of the soul?

00:01:02.088 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is the
part of our journey

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.870 align:middle line:84%
where we must conquer
our biggest fears

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and come face to face
with what's called

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:90%
the guardian at the threshold.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds
pretty intimidating.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:90%
But what does it mean?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some ways, it's
our defense mechanisms

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that try to hold us back from
doing anything too risky.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
And in other ways, it's
the projection of our fears

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.900 align:middle line:90%
into the unknown.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.290 align:middle line:90%
But here, they stare back at us.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.660 align:middle line:84%
In order to pass
through this dark night,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
we must have the courage to meet
our guardian at the threshold

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.860 align:middle line:90%
head on and face our fears.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
we try to avoid it?

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, so long as we keep
projecting our fears

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.990 align:middle line:84%
and judgments onto other
things outside of us,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%
we're essentially putting
the face of our shadow side

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.190 align:middle line:90%
onto others.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
We're neither owning nor
recognizing our shadow.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Accepting and working
with our own shadow side

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely necessary to move
through the dark night stage

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:84%
and continue onward with
the alchemical process.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.280 align:middle line:90%
So what is the shadow side?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the work of Carl
Jung, the shadow side

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.320 align:middle line:84%
is defined as the parts
of us that we haven't

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:90%
accepted or acknowledged.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.400 align:middle line:90%
We either deny them.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Or we just don't believe
they're part of us.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
The shadow side
includes things that we

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
don't like about ourselves
that we try to hide.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just the bad
things or the things we fear.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
The shadow side also contains
many of our gifts and things

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:90%
that we admire in others.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But we don't realize that these
qualities also exist within us.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.620 align:middle line:84%
For example, sometimes
we see other people

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:90%
doing great things.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And we lift them
up on a pedestal.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
But when we do the
same, we may not

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.370 align:middle line:84%
recognize that we too are
capable of those great things.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:84%
We might not see it as
a gift that we have.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
What we must realize is that
if we can admire it in another,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:90%
then it's also part of us.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.050 align:middle line:84%
The shadow side is
full of light and gifts

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't yet acknowledged
or claimed within ourselves.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.290 align:middle line:84%
We have to accept that
these are part of us too.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
If we judge someone as
less than or better than,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.740 align:middle line:84%
well, that means that we're
also judging ourselves

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.020 align:middle line:90%
as less than or better than.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Only when we can stop
projecting it outwardly

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:84%
and look inwardly,
and then accept this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:84%
is me can we then progress in
our transformational journey.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's them.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's also me.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:90%
We're all one.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:90%
And the world is our mirror.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So we can ask, if I don't like
what I'm seeing out there,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
what do I need to change
within me to shift it?

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And if I like what I see within
certain people, what must

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:90%
I do to reclaim it for myself?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's say there's
someone you admire.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:90%
And you want to be like them.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:84%
You want to do what they do and
have what they have, and so on.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, then ask, what did
they do to get there?

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Then recreate that in your
own life using the same steps

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:90%
and tools.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.180 align:middle line:84%
If it worked for them,
it can work for you.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So how do we work
with our shadow

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.970 align:middle line:84%
and bring ourselves into a
state of greater wholeness?

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is where the
real challenge begins.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.810 align:middle line:84%
It's that point where we begin
to recognize our own judgments,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
fears, and anger.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And we become aware of the
ways that we separate ourselves

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.220 align:middle line:90%
from others.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we start to face
this, our first reaction

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.820 align:middle line:90%
might be to judge ourselves.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.860 align:middle line:84%
We start to not like
ourselves very much.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Or we might lose hope
or faith in the light.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Because all we see is dark.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the dark night
of the soul experience.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very
challenging place to be.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The good news is that it's
precisely within this shadow

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.760 align:middle line:84%
that we can find the light
at the end of the tunnel

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.980 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.140 align:middle line:84%
This is where we find the
fuel to make our gold.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, in alchemy, we talk
about turning lead into gold.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Lead relates to the
impure parts of ourselves

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.110 align:middle line:84%
that we want to transform
and transmute into gold.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:84%
We want to bring this into our
highest potential, perfection,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:90%
and beauty.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that we have
to go into the shadow to find

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:90%
the raw materia, or the prima.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
This is the essence
that has the most

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:90%
potential to become the gold.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to be
found in the parts we're

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:90%
conscious of already.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
It'll be found in the shadow
side, the parts that are

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
hidden within the subconscious.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's because these
are our blind spots.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
They're the parts
of us that we fail

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:90%
to recognize within ourselves.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.250 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe we recognize them, but
we haven't accepted them yet.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And until we accept them
and learn to love ourselves,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.250 align:middle line:84%
even with those flaws,
they'll continue

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.512 align:middle line:84%
to hide in the shadows of our
subconscious and control us.

00:06:25.512 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where
our work truly lies.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a profound
spiritual process

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
to come to honor, accept,
and reintegrate our shadow.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is essential to
us becoming whole again.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Does everyone have a shadow?

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And where exactly does
the shadow come from?

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, first off, yes, in
this physical density,

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:90%
we all have a shadow.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And we divide ourselves
into an ego and a shadow.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Because our culture insists that
we behave in acceptable ways.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And as we're trying to
fit into social norms

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:84%
and behave acceptably, we start
to suppress parts of ourself.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.080 align:middle line:84%
This is because we're culturally
and socially programmed.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And this then creates
the ego and the shadow.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, the way that we're
defining the ego here

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:84%
is according to the
Jungian definition, which

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:84%
is the conscious mind, thoughts,
and memories of ourselves

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.005 align:middle line:90%
that we're aware of.

00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, in other episodes, we've
called this our positive ego.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to our self
identity and personality.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But our personality is also
influenced by our programming

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:90%
and upbringing.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, where we get
into trouble here

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is when we confuse our true
self with our personality.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.970 align:middle line:84%
As we reclaim our true self, a
big part of what we have to do

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.730 align:middle line:84%
is strip away that
cultural programming

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.960 align:middle line:90%
and start to question it.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
We should ask ourselves,
is this really true?

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just what I've
been taught to believe?

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
We all have things
that we're raised with,

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
like certain sayings we
heard a lot while growing up.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Things like, money
doesn't grow on trees.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Or just be happy
with what you've got.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Some of these might
even seem positive.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But think about the programming
that's taking place.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:27.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we say, just
be happy with what you've got,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:29.790 align:middle line:84%
it also implies that
we shouldn't want more

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.020 align:middle line:90%
or strive for more.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:10%
And part of our
process is to look

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:10%
at these belief systems,
or scripts, that

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:10%
are playing out in our mind.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
tell us what's expected

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:90%
and what's acceptable.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It's all the ways
that were raised,

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
the things we're
taught to judge,

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.840 align:middle line:90%
and how to fit in socially.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
These are a big part of
what forms our shadow.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
The shadow is all the
impulses and behaviors

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:90%
that we've suppressed.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Because we were taught
they're unacceptable.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And we'd be judged for them.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
So we need to reassess
these indoctrinations

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:90%
and programming.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:15.460 align:middle line:84%
We also need to look at any
unresolved or unhealed traumas

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.680 align:middle line:90%
from the past.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:84%
What happens is we create
fears and belief systems

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.720 align:middle line:90%
as a result of those traumas.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.595 align:middle line:84%
And in order to cope, we
suppress parts of the trauma

00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:30.485 align:middle line:84%
and just try to
move on with life.

00:09:30.485 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And those pieces that
aren't fully healed

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:90%
get folded in to our shadow.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:84%
This may include false
beliefs about ourselves.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, we
buy into the idea

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
that we're not worthy
or good enough.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:84%
This then leads to low
self-esteem and low self-image.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
But we have these great gifts,
great light, and great worth.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
And yet, if we don't believe
that about ourselves,

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
then all of that
beauty and goodness

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:90%
gets hidden in our shadow.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.870 align:middle line:84%
These are the things we
need to reassess and face

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:90%
within ourselves.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.644 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.644 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, why is it so hard to
let go of these old programs?

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when we
strip away the stories

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.300 align:middle line:84%
that we've been told and start
to question and challenge them?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, in Kabbalah
for example, as we

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.080 align:middle line:84%
go through the alchemical
process of ascending

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life, we
eventually come to a point

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:84%
where we're standing at
the edge of the abyss.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And this point on the
journey up the tree

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.350 align:middle line:84%
coincides with that dark
night of the soul stage.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:84%
So imagine, you're standing
at this great abyss.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:84%
And on the other side of it is a
state of oneness and wholeness.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.552 align:middle line:84%
How do we get across
to that light?

00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, in order to get there,
we must shed the personality

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:90%
and let it die.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We even have to shed
some of our individuality

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.695 align:middle line:90%
in order to return to oneness.

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening here
is that we're not just

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
being asked to let go of what's
limiting, or holding us back.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes it's
the things that we

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:84%
think are good that are
slowing down our progression.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:84%
We may have
attachments to things

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.890 align:middle line:90%
that have served us to a point.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.470 align:middle line:84%
But now, we're just
clinging to them,

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
safe and familiar.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And letting go might mean losing
a core piece of our identity

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.040 align:middle line:90%
and sense of who we are.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
But what we're letting go of
here is not our true self.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It's our personality that's
been programmed through our life

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And only when we let go
and let the personality

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.155 align:middle line:84%
die can we reclaim our
true self-identity.

00:11:50.155 --> 00:11:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, the core fear
that we encounter here

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:90%
is essentially a fear of death.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a fear of annihilation
and loss of identity.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:84%
We've come to this
place where we realize,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not who I thought I was.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And the world isn't
what I thought it was.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.170 align:middle line:84%
We've been comparing
ourselves to some kind

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.180 align:middle line:90%
of social standard.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we've been
programmed to accept and value.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:84%
But often, these are
based on a corrupt system

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:90%
with its own wounding.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's not based
on universal truths.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
We fight to fit in and
uphold this standard.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:84%
But then we start to
realize this isn't me.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.690 align:middle line:84%
We know we can't
keep up the charade.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.180 align:middle line:84%
But now, we don't
know what to do.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:90%
It's a loss of identity.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we lose that,
we go into a process

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.010 align:middle line:90%
of self annihilation.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Or in alchemy we
call it fermentation.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
This all contributes
to this experience

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.140 align:middle line:90%
of the dark night of the soul.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.780 align:middle line:90%
So how do we get through this?

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, once we
realize that we can

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
let go of who we thought we
were, in order to redefine

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and recreate ourselves,
then everything changes.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:90%
We open up and trust.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:90%
We surrender to a higher power.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And we call that into
our life to help us find

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.750 align:middle line:90%
our way through the darkness.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're in darkness,
and even though we don't

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
hear that voice of
spirit guiding us,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:90%
we must continue to trust.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Or we may not even know if
we believe in that right now.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.270 align:middle line:84%
But we must still come
to a point of surrender.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
We have to trust that the
divine is still there.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Or that things will get
better, even if it feels silent

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.721 align:middle line:84%
and like we're
immersed in darkness.

00:13:47.721 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, at this stage of
fermentation in the soul,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.660 align:middle line:90%
it isn't a place to give in.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Surrendering is
different from giving in.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Giving in usually means
that we've lost hope

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:84%
and are wallowing deeper
into the darkness.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a battle
happening inside of us here.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
A battle where we must
face our own darkness,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.520 align:middle line:84%
recognize that we're in it,
and pull ourselves through it.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
We must hold on to hope and
trust in the light and divine

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:90%
presence to guide us.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Trust that this divine
spirit is still a part of us.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.540 align:middle line:84%
Our divinity can be just as
much a part of our shadow

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.300 align:middle line:90%
as the parts that we dislike.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.260 align:middle line:84%
For example, how many of us have
truly embraced the knowledge

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.230 align:middle line:84%
that we are an
eternal being, that we

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
are the creator of our life,
and we are all powerful,

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:90%
we are limitless?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.530 align:middle line:84%
How many of us have truly
accepted and claimed this?

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
To do so means taking
responsibility for our life.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And not many people really
want to be responsible.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%
So they deny their power.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.760 align:middle line:84%
We also need to realize
that the divine doesn't only

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:90%
mean it's only good.

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the divine also includes
those shadow sides of us

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:90%
that we're rejecting.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
We must accept that we
have both light and dark,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:90%
both good and evil within.

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Our goal isn't to be
all one or the other,

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.160 align:middle line:84%
but to stand in the
balance between them

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.600 align:middle line:84%
at the fulcrum point, and to use
both in service to the greater

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.920 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
This is how we wield
this towards progression,

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
towards the purpose that
we're here to fulfill

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.508 align:middle line:84%
and the things
we're here to learn.

00:15:33.508 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, finding the
fulcrum where we

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
can stand in that
balance point is what we

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:90%
call living the middle pillar.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Our goal here is to
recognize that yes, I

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:90%
have light within me.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.430 align:middle line:90%
And yes, I have darkness.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But neither of those
things define me.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.391 align:middle line:90%
I stand in the center.

00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, depending on our
relationship with our shadow,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
we can either create a
heaven or a hell in our life.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Whatever we choose to
make out of this life,

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.720 align:middle line:84%
it's coming from deep
within the subconscious.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.700 align:middle line:84%
Just like alchemy is
based on harnessing

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.600 align:middle line:84%
the tension between
differences, our inner alchemy

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.250 align:middle line:84%
is driven by this tension
between our ego and our shadow,

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:84%
between the conscious
and the subconscious.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, this tension is
something that we can harness.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But we can only do that when
we stop projecting it outwardly

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and start owning it inwardly.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.500 align:middle line:90%
Recognize this is me.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And the great work
is to know thyself.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So rather than
despising, denying,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
or fearing those
parts of ourselves,

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:46.490 align:middle line:84%
we can now recognize that
herein lies the potential gold.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Here, within the shadow,
there's great power.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And here is great possibility
for personal awakening

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:84%
and breakthroughs, and
not only for ourselves.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.590 align:middle line:84%
If we want to make a
positive impact in the world,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.545 align:middle line:84%
we'll become far more effective
once we integrate our shadow.

00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.523 align:middle line:84%
Now, what might this
process look like?

00:17:09.523 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, to give you
a sense of this,

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.045 align:middle line:90%
I'll share a personal story.

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:14.420 align:middle line:84%
At one point in
my journey, I was

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.240 align:middle line:84%
doing a series of somatic
experiencing sessions

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.230 align:middle line:84%
to release some unresolved
trauma within my body.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
During some of these
sessions, I came face

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.859 align:middle line:84%
to face with my guardian
at the threshold.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.160 align:middle line:84%
And with somatic
experiencing, we

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
engage our active imagination
and a certain level

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:90%
of body awareness.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:84%
The practitioner
provides feedback

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.470 align:middle line:84%
to help us get out of the story
and into those subtle body

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:84%
sensations and imagery rising
up from the subconscious.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
We were focusing on an area
of my back between my shoulder

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:90%
blades.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And as I shifted my awareness
deeper into this area,

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
the first thing I encountered
was this guardian.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And let me tell you,
this was a grumpy,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
hunchback looking character that
was rigidly clinging to a staff

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:90%
to help hold it up.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And it had a rather unpleasant
and jaded temperament.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, as if that wasn't bad
enough, in one of the sessions,

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
I also realized
that this character

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.020 align:middle line:90%
was guarding something else.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, some part of me that
I hadn't yet recognized,

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:90%
or resolved, was behind it.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
But before I could
discover what that was,

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I first had to
face this guardian.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I listened
to this part of me,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I realized it was an
attachment to needing

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.650 align:middle line:90%
to be strong and upright.

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.550 align:middle line:84%
This part of me was working so
hard at doing that, that it had

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.175 align:middle line:90%
become rigid and overburdened.

00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I accepted
my flaws and I

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.820 align:middle line:84%
showed gratitude and
forgiveness, then it released.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was then able to
move beyond this guardian

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:49.865 align:middle line:90%
and go even deeper.

00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, behind the guardian though,
was an image of a black tar

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.195 align:middle line:90%
pit with an inky film on top.

00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And as I approached
it in my mind

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.190 align:middle line:90%
I saw a hand reaching out of it.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I grabbed the hand to
try and help whatever

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:90%
it was in that pit to come out.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But if I tried to pull it
out, it tried to pull me in.

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.620 align:middle line:90%
And there was a struggle.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I
tried to pull whatever

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
it was out of into
the light, it equally

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.490 align:middle line:84%
tried to pull me
into the darkness.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
I realized this was a part of
my shadow side, a part of me

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.010 align:middle line:90%
that I had rejected.

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I was afraid
of going into that darkness,

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:84%
it was afraid of
coming into the light.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
It was afraid that if
it came into the light

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:90%
it would be annihilated.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Because it's made of the dark.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I realized
I couldn't force my will here.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.066 align:middle line:90%
So what could I do?

00:19:49.066 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I discovered it
was there, because I

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
had been programmed with
a dualistic thinking that

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.590 align:middle line:90%
created a split in my mind.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It was a result of a belief that
light is good and dark is bad.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, I intuitively
knew that I had

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:09.680 align:middle line:84%
to bring love rather than fear
or judging to the darkness.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.250 align:middle line:84%
So I shifted from
this tug of war

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.300 align:middle line:90%
to flowing love and acceptance.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And as I brought in this
love and acceptance,

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.950 align:middle line:90%
it dissolved the darkness.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And there was a big
release that I physically

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.160 align:middle line:90%
felt within my body and mind.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And what came out
of that experience

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.580 align:middle line:84%
was a new awareness of my
own fear of annihilation.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.092 align:middle line:90%
It was very archetypal.

00:20:33.092 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, trying to struggle
wasn't getting me anywhere.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Only love could come in
to neutralize and heal

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:90%
that situation.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Love, acceptance, and compassion
that really is the key here.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:51.270 align:middle line:84%
We need to love ourselves and
realize that we're not perfect

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.550 align:middle line:90%
and be OK with that.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to always meet
the expectations of society.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And other people aren't always
going to meet our expectations.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.490 align:middle line:84%
When we continue to return
to love, compassion,

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:10.650 align:middle line:84%
and acceptance, when we truly
and fully accept ourselves,

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.348 align:middle line:84%
this brings us into an
integrated wholeness.

00:21:15.348 --> 00:21:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does it take to do
this work of facing the shadow

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.170 align:middle line:90%
side?

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you can
see from my story,

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
it was a highly symbolic
process that involved

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:90%
the use of active imagination.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Another way we can
work with the shadow

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:90%
is through dreams and visions.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Through these methods, we can
access the archetypal realm

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.560 align:middle line:90%
of the psyche.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Our shadows exists
within the subconscious.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And archetypal
imagery can help us

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:90%
access this deep inner place.

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
When we're dealing
with our shadow side,

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:84%
there's usually going to
be a sense of antagonism.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a
dream and that dream

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:84%
then becomes a struggle,
or even a nightmare,

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
or rather than running away
from it though, or fighting it,

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.610 align:middle line:84%
we need to face it
and not be afraid.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.460 align:middle line:84%
In the Kabbalistic
journey of ascending

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the tree of life, when
we come to the stage

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.060 align:middle line:84%
at the edge of the abyss, one
of the things we must talk about

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:90%
is death.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.930 align:middle line:90%
What happens when we die?

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:90%
In short, we go on.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
We're not just this physical
body or this identity even.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:90%
We're so much more than that.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
But in order to reclaim more
of the fullness of who we are,

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.720 align:middle line:90%
we have to accept and let go.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to face our fears and
let go of the attachments that

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.610 align:middle line:90%
hold us back.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
We need to be willing to
sacrifice our identity and even

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:84%
some of the things
that we value in order

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.300 align:middle line:90%
to rise to something higher.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.915 align:middle line:84%
What is that something
higher that we're reclaiming?

00:22:47.915 --> 00:22:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's our wholeness,
our divinity, our eternity,

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:90%
and our limitlessness.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.040 align:middle line:84%
In order to get
there, we really need

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.990 align:middle line:84%
to walk forward into the
unknown with a sense of trust.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a sense of knowing
there is a divine source.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Or at least there's
something greater

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:90%
that we're moving towards.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, contained
within the unknown

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.590 align:middle line:90%
is infinite possibility.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.905 align:middle line:84%
As we move into it, we
can recreate ourselves.

00:23:16.905 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And by reclaiming
our wholeness, we

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.920 align:middle line:84%
can create a new and
better life for ourselves.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.950 align:middle line:84%
At this stage in the
spiritual alchemy process,

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:30.300 align:middle line:84%
we'd go on a vision quest or
do some deep soul searching.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:84%
In order to tune in,
we need to shut off

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.940 align:middle line:84%
the distractions that keep
us from facing whatever

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:90%
it is that's going on inside.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.900 align:middle line:84%
We immerse ourselves into the
darkness, sometimes literally.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, initiates of
old would go into a dark cave

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
or use some form of
sensory deprivation

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.560 align:middle line:84%
to move their awareness
deeper within.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes this immersion
is a metaphorical sense.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the darkness of the self
and the aspects of ourselves

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that we have
rejected in the past.

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Imagine for a moment that
you're going on a vision quest

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:84%
out into the desert,
fasting and alone.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It's just you and nature.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.796 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
survive on your own.

00:24:15.796 --> 00:24:17.920 align:middle line:84%
So you find a spot
where you decide

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:84%
to set space and do your
prayers and vision questing.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, as night falls, you
feel cold and hungry.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And you find that you have to
fight your own ego in order

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.000 align:middle line:90%
to keep going.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.190 align:middle line:84%
It all comes up, doubts, fear,
judgment, anger, desperation,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.050 align:middle line:90%
temptation to quit.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
All of this inner darkness
comes to the surface.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.770 align:middle line:84%
But you know you must
persevere through it

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and not give in or give up.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And through this process, you're
conquering your lower self

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.340 align:middle line:90%
and continuing to press forward.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, the big task is to
overcome the inner darkness

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.320 align:middle line:90%
and not lose faith.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.330 align:middle line:10%
Now imagine yourself
in the position

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.970 align:middle line:10%
of the hanged man in the
major arcana of the tarot

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:10%
or as Odin who hung upside
down on the tree for nine

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:16.240 align:middle line:10%
days and nights with no food or
water, wounded by his own blade

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:22.060 align:middle line:10%
and bleeding onto the earth,
a willing self-sacrifice.

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Feel how intense that is.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Odin hung there like that
for nine days and nights

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.630 align:middle line:84%
before he spied
the magical runes.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.475 align:middle line:84%
A vision granted
to him by the gods.

00:25:33.475 --> 00:25:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the fermentation,
or death, of the personality.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's not done until we
receive that divine vision.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not something we
can force or shortcut.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.550 align:middle line:84%
It must be earned by being
truly ready to sacrifice

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:84%
our old identity and
submit to a higher power.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.610 align:middle line:84%
This is the point of
transition, of breaking

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
through that dark
night of the soul

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and coming into the
enlightened state.

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the process is
not complete yet.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But we've made a
major breakthrough.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And next, we move into
refining and integrating

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.390 align:middle line:90%
with our greater self.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:middle line:84%
In chemical and
physical alchemy,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:84%
this stage would involve
taking our solution

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and putting it in a dark space,
like a closet or a cupboard,

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
with a slow gentle
heat warming it.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.430 align:middle line:90%
As it heats up, it rots.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And any parts that
are still corruptible,

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.400 align:middle line:90%
experience a slow death.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.330 align:middle line:84%
As it rots, it then
releases the spirit.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And in alchemy, they also call
this process putrefaction.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'd let it sit in
that warm, dark place

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.240 align:middle line:84%
with a slow gentle heat for
a couple of moon phases,

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:84%
until it forms an
oily rainbow colored

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.640 align:middle line:90%
film on the top of the ferment.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
This marks a transition out of
what's called the black phase

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and into what's called the
yellow phase of alchemy.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.830 align:middle line:84%
They also call this point of
transition the peacock's tail.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:07.750 align:middle line:10%
Now, everything that's
left is of a pure essence.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:09.610 align:middle line:10%
Dennis Hauck refers
to this stage

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.770 align:middle line:10%
as the ray of the
spiritual warrior.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.285 align:middle line:84%
It's also known as
the shaman's death.

00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, once we make it
through this stage,

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.590 align:middle line:84%
it's like we've
recreated ourselves.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Who we were before now feels
like a whole other lifetime

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.090 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And we may go through this
kind of alchemical process

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:90%
many times in our life.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:10%
Now, in the emerald tablet,
it speaks of this stage

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:10%
by saying, "Thou shalt
separate the earth

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:41.590 align:middle line:10%
from the fine, the subtle from
the gross, gently with much

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.380 align:middle line:10%
sagacity."

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Fermentation is sped
up through imagination

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and through a willingness
to look deep within and ask

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:90%
the right questions.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Through this process
we engage our shadow

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and face it, rather than
running away from it.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
We willingly walk into
the fire and allow

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
it to burn away the corruptible
aspects of the self.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Whatever remains after is
our pure essence that then

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:15.170 align:middle line:90%
becomes our new foundation.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's go deeper into
a guided journey

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.550 align:middle line:90%
to experience this process.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Start by closing your eyes
and take several deep breaths,

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.880 align:middle line:84%
breathing in through the
nose and breathing out

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.680 align:middle line:90%
through the mouth.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Relax each part of your
body beginning at your feet

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and working your way up all
the way to the head and face.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.585 align:middle line:84%
And continue breathing as
you relax even more deeply.

00:28:44.585 --> 00:28:50.360 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:56.750 align:middle line:84%
As you relax your body, you
also allow your mind to relax.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.800 align:middle line:84%
And to further empty your
mind, imagine a river

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.630 align:middle line:90%
running through your mind.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And send any thoughts
into the river

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.670 align:middle line:90%
and let them be washed away.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:90%


00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:18.980 align:middle line:84%
As you enter your mind more and
more, become still and quiet.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.030 align:middle line:84%
And now allow yourself
to feel completely

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.520 align:middle line:90%
relaxed and peaceful.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:29.500 align:middle line:90%


00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Come to that state of stillness,
emptiness, quietness within.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And now ask yourself
these questions.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:48.140 align:middle line:84%
What still needs to die within
me in order to break through?

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And what knowledge do
I still need in order

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.980 align:middle line:90%
to complete my transformation?

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.580 align:middle line:84%
What knowledge of
myself do I need?

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:02.532 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.532 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you hold these
questions in mind,

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.030 align:middle line:84%
focus on the pause
between your breaths,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.175 align:middle line:90%
the silence between the words.

00:30:12.175 --> 00:30:15.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:21.885 align:middle line:84%
Connect to the stillness of the
gap, the space between things.

00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:27.010 align:middle line:90%


00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:29.355 align:middle line:90%
Be silent.

00:30:29.355 --> 00:30:31.980 align:middle line:90%
Be still.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.255 align:middle line:90%
Go inward for answers.

00:30:33.255 --> 00:30:37.070 align:middle line:90%


00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:42.470 align:middle line:84%
Seek deep within and let the
answers mature within you,

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.510 align:middle line:84%
until something
rises to the surface.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:55.970 align:middle line:90%


00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:59.125 align:middle line:84%
Now, a spark ignites
within your heart.

00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And this spark grows into a
violet flame of transformation

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.420 align:middle line:90%
and transmutation.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:90%
Let it grow within your heart.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.440 align:middle line:84%
Let it gently warm your
body with this inner fire.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Whatever this flame
touches, if it's

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:84%
corruptible in nature in
any way, it will burn away.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.780 align:middle line:84%
But if it's incorruptible, if
it's part of your true essence,

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.795 align:middle line:84%
it will be refined and
matured by this fire.

00:31:26.795 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:84%
As the fire burns
away the dross,

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:84%
everything that the fire burns
transforms into a golden light.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Within your aura,
within your field,

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.680 align:middle line:84%
visualize all these
impurities being transformed

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and transmuted by this fire,
until your aura becomes

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.630 align:middle line:90%
flecked with gold.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And this golden aura
indicates that you

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:01.385 align:middle line:84%
have raised up to a more
pure and refined state.

00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:10.600 align:middle line:90%


00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, also bring in the
heart flame of love,

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.430 align:middle line:84%
or that Christ consciousness
ray, that energy and essence

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:19.930 align:middle line:90%
of love.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And as this flame of
love, this ray, comes in,

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:27.340 align:middle line:84%
it draws everything
together within you.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.205 align:middle line:84%
And all of those golden
sparks start to coalesce.

00:32:30.205 --> 00:32:35.060 align:middle line:90%


00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.190 align:middle line:84%
The golden sparks continue to
be drawn together until they

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.990 align:middle line:90%
come into a singular point.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And this point becomes a
bright, golden light shining out

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.700 align:middle line:90%
from the center of your being.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.110 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:84%
This flame of love,
wherever it touches

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:84%
your light or your dark, it
helps to unify and bring them

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.250 align:middle line:90%
into wholeness.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Let it flow through you.

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Let it flow out into your aura.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And then let it
flow back in again.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Drawing everything together
into that single point

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:14.700 align:middle line:90%
at the center of your being.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:31.160 align:middle line:90%


00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.330 align:middle line:84%
Continue focusing on this golden
light flowing through you,

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.645 align:middle line:84%
emanating out, and then coming
back to the center point.

00:33:38.645 --> 00:33:43.085 align:middle line:90%


00:33:43.085 --> 00:33:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And now begin returning to
your waking consciousness,

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.280 align:middle line:90%
taking your time.

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Wiggle your toes and fingers.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
gently open your eyes

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:58.416 align:middle line:84%
remembering everything
from this meditation.

00:33:58.416 --> 00:34:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, this simple
visualization process

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:84%
is something you can work
with on a daily basis

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.080 align:middle line:84%
to support you with your
own personal transformation.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.659 align:middle line:84%
It's lighting that
gentle inner fire

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
that keeps the alchemical
process moving forward

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.240 align:middle line:90%
through this stage.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, it takes
the discipline and devotion

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.969 align:middle line:84%
of daily practice to
move through this stage.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Patience is required of us
here while also holding on

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.260 align:middle line:84%
to that inner knowing and hope
that we'll find our way out

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.469 align:middle line:84%
of the darkness
and into the light.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
As Kabbalists, we
have a statement

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.280 align:middle line:84%
we use on a daily
basis to support

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.530 align:middle line:90%
this practice in our life.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:84%
We say, I come out of the
darkness into the light.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:46.090 align:middle line:90%
I come with nothing.

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I empty myself of all things.

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.730 align:middle line:90%
I am an empty vessel.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.469 align:middle line:90%
I know nothing.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.330 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:56.820 align:middle line:90%
I am no thing.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.540 align:middle line:90%


00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I am ready
to receive all things

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
from the universe and
flow these in service

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:12.200 align:middle line:84%
to the light to create a
better life and a better world.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as we explore how
energy flows from the source

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.860 align:middle line:84%
through all the different
planes of vibration,

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.890 align:middle line:90%
until it reaches the physical.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:23.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Teresa Bullard.

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
exploring how to move

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.870 align:middle line:84%
through the dark night
of the soul with me

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in this episode of
"Mystery Teachings."

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.070 align:middle line:90%
