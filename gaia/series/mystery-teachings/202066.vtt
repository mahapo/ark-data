00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Dr. Theresa Bullard
host of "Mystery Teachings."

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:10%
Today We're going to meditate
on the archetypes of Justice

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.680 align:middle line:10%
and the Hanged Man.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:10%
Together they help us with
the principles of equilibrium

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.800 align:middle line:10%
and making sacrifices in life.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.950 align:middle line:10%
Justice supports us with
weighing decisions and taking

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:10%
action towards the highest
good, while the Hanged Man helps

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:10%
us to surrender to
divine will, hanging

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:10%
new perspectives in life.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Here's a formula to
follow for invoking

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330 align:middle line:84%
these two archetypes,
Justice and the Hanged Man,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.960 align:middle line:90%
into your life.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:84%
We'll first work with
one card at a time,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:90%
beginning with Justice.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Once you're ready, find the
Justice card in your deck

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:90%
and take it out.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Place this card in front
of you at eye level.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a meditation
stool or a cushion,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
you can sit on that
in front of a table

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:84%
and then place the card
upright on the table.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Get yourself into a relaxed
position and a light meditative

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:90%
Take several deep breaths.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Relax your body.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.390 align:middle line:90%
Begin to quiet your mind.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Empty your mind, and bring
yourself into a positive

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and/or a neutral
state of being, one

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
where you don't feel disturbed
either mentally or emotionally

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.240 align:middle line:90%
by anything.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Just bring yourself
into that state

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:90%
of calm, peace, and relaxation.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Once you've established that
peace, now open your eyes

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:84%
and look at the image of the
Justice card for a while.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.690 align:middle line:10%
Keeping your eyes open for
about five to 10 minutes,

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.710 align:middle line:10%
study its imagery,
its symbolism.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:10%
Take in all the details.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:10%
Memorize the imagery
of this card.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.735 align:middle line:10%
Notice things that you maybe
haven't noticed before.

00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:10%


00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:10%
Look for subtle details.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.610 align:middle line:10%
And really study these
images and symbols.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.820 align:middle line:10%
Contemplate their
meaning as you do.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%


00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:10%
I'll remain silent now
for the next five minutes

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.480 align:middle line:10%
as we now meditate on the
symbolism of the card.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:07:19.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.590 align:middle line:84%
It's now time to take
it inside and to work

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:90%
with it in your mind.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
So now close your eyes and work
with the image of the Justice

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
key within your mind
for another 10 minutes.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Recreate the image in your mind.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:90%
Build it up.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Bring in all the details,
all the color, all the sense,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:84%
the energy, the way of
expressing that we see

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:90%
within the beings in this card.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame of
the card is like a doorway

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and the imagery of the
card is on the other side

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:90%
of that doorway.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Once you've firmly established
this image within your mind,

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
now you're going to walk
through that doorway

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.580 align:middle line:90%
and let it come to life.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Move into the
scenery of the card

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and allow it to take on a
three-dimensional virtual

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.040 align:middle line:90%
reality type of experience.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Let Justice come
alive and animate.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.410 align:middle line:90%
And just observe for a while.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:90%
What does she do?

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:90%
How does she behave?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.835 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy that
Justice emanates.

00:08:27.835 --> 00:08:30.010 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps she has
a message for you.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:13:14.870 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:10%
When you feel strongly
connected with this energy

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.380 align:middle line:10%
and it's fully alive
within your mind,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:10%
the next step is to
merge with Justice.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Become Justice.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.930 align:middle line:10%
See her come alive within you.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:10%
Feel yourself wearing
the robes of Justice,

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:10%
the crown of Justice, holding
the sword and the scales,

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.530 align:middle line:10%
standing or sitting
between the two pillars.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel
integrated with this energy,

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:10%
now you're going to
sit up in a chair

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:10%
and actually take on
that posture of Justice.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:10%
Physically assume her archetypal
form and body position

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.440 align:middle line:10%
with your right hand
holding an upright sword

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.990 align:middle line:10%
and your left hand
holding the scales.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:08.370 align:middle line:10%
And from this position, you're
going to say this affirmation--

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.400 align:middle line:10%
I am the daughter of
the Lords of Truth

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:10%
and the ruler of the balance.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:90%
My heart is true and pure.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.625 align:middle line:90%
My actions are just.

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.970 align:middle line:10%
Allow that affirmation to
reverberate through your being,

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:33.710 align:middle line:10%
to awaken your cells, to vibrate
throughout your whole being

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.606 align:middle line:10%
and soul.

00:14:35.606 --> 00:14:37.215 align:middle line:10%
And let it integrate.

00:14:37.215 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're
ready we're now

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.030 align:middle line:84%
going to do the same process
with the Hanged Man key.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So take the Hanged Man
key out of your deck.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Place it in front of you where
you can sit on your meditation

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.860 align:middle line:90%
stool and meditate upon it.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Begin by studying
it with your eyes

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
open for five to 10
minutes, meditating

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
on the imagery, the symbols,
studying all the details,

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.760 align:middle line:84%
taking it all in and memorizing
it, noticing subtle things,

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.945 align:middle line:90%
contemplating the meaning.

00:15:44.945 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And the next step will be to
bring it inside for 10 minutes.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:84%
You're going to work
with the Hanged Man key

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.650 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes closed.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Within your inner mind,
recreate the image.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that the frame
of the card is a doorway,

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and the Hanged Man, hanging from
his tree, is on the other side.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Build up this image firmly
and strongly within your mind.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Bring all the colors,
all the details in.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And work with that in your inner
mind for another 10 minutes.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.950 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And then when you feel
it's firmly established,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.900 align:middle line:84%
you're going to let
it come to life.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Walk through the
doorway into the scenery

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:84%
and let it take on a
three-dimensional reality

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.590 align:middle line:90%
around you.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Use all five of your
senses to engage with it.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.350 align:middle line:90%
Observe it.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Feel the energy and the ways
of being of the Hanged Man.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.015 align:middle line:90%
Notice what he does.

00:21:46.015 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Does he have any message?

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.010 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Or does he just hang there
in silence and suspended

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:53.430 align:middle line:90%
animation?

00:21:53.430 --> 00:26:43.349 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.349 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:10%
And when you feel firmly
connected with this energy,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.380 align:middle line:10%
next you're going to
merge with the Hanged Man.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.960 align:middle line:10%
Become the Hanged Man.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.600 align:middle line:10%
Feel the Hanged Man
come alive within you,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:10%
and see yourself as him.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.680 align:middle line:10%
When you feel this
integrating within you,

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.730 align:middle line:10%
now you're going to physically
lay down on your back

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:10%
or, if you are
really into yoga, you

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:10%
can take an inverted position.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.920 align:middle line:10%
But it's OK to just
lay down on your back

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.890 align:middle line:10%
and take on the
posture of Hanged Man.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.730 align:middle line:10%
Assume his archetypal form,
putting your right leg

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.750 align:middle line:10%
stretched out straight while
you cross your left ankle

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.490 align:middle line:10%
behind the right thigh.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.360 align:middle line:10%
And also, fold your arms behind
your back with the elbows

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.470 align:middle line:10%
out to the side.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:10%
And once you're
in this position,

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.710 align:middle line:10%
you're going to say
the affirmation,

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:10%
I am the spirit of
the mighty waters.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.855 align:middle line:10%
I am the quiet pond.

00:27:48.855 --> 00:27:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:10%
I surrender to the
universal mind.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.120 align:middle line:10%
Not my will, but thine.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:10%
Feel that affirmation,
that energy

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:10.880 align:middle line:10%
reverberate throughout your
being, activating your cells,

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:10%
awakening its energy within you.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:55.115 align:middle line:90%


00:28:55.115 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you're
ready, we're going

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.970 align:middle line:10%
to place both the Justice
and the Hanged Man cards next

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:10%
to each other and meditate
upon them together.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.730 align:middle line:10%
We're going to put Justice on
the left and the Hanged Man

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.010 align:middle line:10%
on the right.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.960 align:middle line:10%
As you meditate
on them together,

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.390 align:middle line:10%
notice how they contrast
with one another.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:10%
But notice, also, how
they complement each other

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.760 align:middle line:10%
and how they connect together.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:90%


00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:10%
Justice stimulates your
discernment and equilibrium,

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.530 align:middle line:10%
while the Hanged Man
stimulates your ability

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:34.450 align:middle line:10%
to shift perspectives as well
as to access a state of samadhi

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.720 align:middle line:10%
or transcendence.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.580 align:middle line:10%
Finally, we want to
take these energies

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.590 align:middle line:10%
and express them into our outer
life so that they can manifest.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:10%
So some things to do are
to bring the primary colors

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.400 align:middle line:10%
into our life--

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:10%
for example, green
and blue-- and

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.170 align:middle line:10%
bring it into your
environment or into the color

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.000 align:middle line:10%
of your clothing.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.550 align:middle line:10%
You can also continue
to meditate daily

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.910 align:middle line:10%
upon the symbols and the
images for the next week

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.921 align:middle line:10%
as well as using the
affirmations that we just did.

00:30:04.921 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:10%
Now, contemplate the
meaning of each card

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.140 align:middle line:10%
and how it applies to your life.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And watch for the archetypes
to appear in your life,

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.710 align:middle line:84%
whether through your dreams
or through synchronicities,

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:84%
and then analyze the
messages that they're

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.600 align:middle line:90%
trying to share with you.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And pay special attention
to how you personally embody

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.760 align:middle line:84%
these strengths and weaknesses
of each one of these cards,

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.367 align:middle line:84%
and consciously work to make
improvements in these areas.

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:36.700 align:middle line:84%
Realize, again, that when
we're working with archetypes,

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.397 align:middle line:84%
they will set forces
in motion in your life.

00:30:40.397 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going
to engage with this

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.890 align:middle line:84%
in an experiential way,
then, again, really

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:84%
commit to seeing it all
the way through, working

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.270 align:middle line:84%
with each card in their proper
order, not skipping any steps,

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.540 align:middle line:84%
and going all the way through
to the end of this series.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Really give it your attention.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:84%
By actively engaging with
the symbols of each key,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.580 align:middle line:84%
we're using these as
communication tools

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.800 align:middle line:90%
and doorways to our true self.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So remember to also keep track
of your dreams, your insights,

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.900 align:middle line:84%
what energies get set
in motion in your life,

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to
help you learn about yourself

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.217 align:middle line:90%
through this journey.

00:31:15.217 --> 00:31:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And to really get the
most out of the tools,

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:19.900 align:middle line:84%
it's about putting
this into application.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Journal your reflections.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Really notice what
you're feeling,

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:84%
what you're experiencing
as these energies

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.635 align:middle line:90%
awaken in your life.

00:31:27.635 --> 00:31:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And then working with
these archetypes,

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:84%
the more we do this, the more
it reorganizes and rewires

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.770 align:middle line:84%
both our brain and
our soul's framework.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And as we become aware
of these archetypes,

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.920 align:middle line:84%
then we can more consciously
perceive them at work

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.710 align:middle line:90%
within our lives.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And this energizes us at that
atomic and cellular level,

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.360 align:middle line:84%
creating that magical
body so that we

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.890 align:middle line:84%
can become more conscious
versions of ourselves.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And through this,
we'll manifest more

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of our potential and our
multi-dimensional essence.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Join me again as
we explore further

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.660 align:middle line:84%
into the 22 archetypes
of Tarot and how

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.060 align:middle line:84%
they can help us to make our
big shift in consciousness.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:90%
