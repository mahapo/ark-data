00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to a
"World of Wisdom."

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.500 align:middle line:84%
And you're about
to take a journey

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
of self discovery with
a very special woman,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
a woman with grace and charm,
warmth and love, a woman

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.670 align:middle line:84%
who has made a difference
in the lives of thousands

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:84%
through walking her talk and
sharing her incredible journey.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Liliane Desjardins is
a counselor, a teacher,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%
and a role model.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And she is here to reveal
to us that which already

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:90%
exists within ourselves.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.910 align:middle line:90%
You are about to be changed.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Liliane Desjardins.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.863 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carolyn.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:90%
It's really a pleasure.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm so excited about what
you guys are doing here.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.600 align:middle line:84%
I didn't mention,
even in the beginning,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:84%
but you are co-founder,
with your husband, Jill,

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
of Pavillon International, a
spiritual renewal and treatment

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.250 align:middle line:90%
center.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we could
begin with how--

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.310 align:middle line:84%
you know, the wake-up
call for yourself

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.040 align:middle line:90%
and how it began for you.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was a
journey of pain.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:10%
In a nutshell, I was born at the
beginning of the Second World

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.700 align:middle line:10%
War, in what used
to be Yugoslavia,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.860 align:middle line:10%
but it's Zagreb, Croatia.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:10%
And I have been witness all
my life to a lot of pain.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Very acutely aware of what
is going on in the world.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Later, I went to
Paris, France-- that's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.220 align:middle line:84%
where I was raised
and educated--

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.740 align:middle line:90%
and then came to Canada.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
The big wake-up call in
my life were addictions.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.270 align:middle line:84%
I come from a background
where addictions were present

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.843 align:middle line:90%
but never really identified.

00:02:48.843 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Sort of accepted,
weren't they?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Just-- that's right.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much talk
today about addiction.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.703 align:middle line:84%
To me, addiction--
and at the Pavillon,

00:02:57.703 --> 00:02:59.120 align:middle line:84%
the way that we
view them, really,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
are stuck energy and attachments
that produce non-growth.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And that was also, in my case,
in my personal case, the story.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the biggest
wake-up call that came

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:22.520 align:middle line:84%
was when my first husband died
of addiction at the age of 40.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.690 align:middle line:90%
That made it personal.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:90%
That made it real.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:90%
It made it totally different.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:84%
That's when I decided
that my life was

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
going to be dedicated not
just to getting better,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.250 align:middle line:84%
not just to recover
from addictions.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's going to be
dedicated to transformation,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.910 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I really
believed that this thing is all

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And addictions are wake-up
calls that do get us

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:90%
to a much deeper place.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:02.480 align:middle line:84%
That it was a walk of pain, that
it was a walk of inner turmoil.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when I
look back, each of them

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
was an incredible stepping
stone for some greater strength,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
some greater and deeper and
more profound wisdom to wake up.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you ever give up?

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:90%
And was there a place that it--

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes, I did.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I--

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:90%
>> More than once?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I gave up a few times.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:84%
But I especially gave up once,
in one of those famous suicides

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
that ended up in a life
after death experience,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
and made all the difference
in the world for me.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Giving up is such
a fabulous concept.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, we give up,
but we don't give up.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.562 align:middle line:84%
Surrender is an
incredible process.

00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> We think we're surrendering
sometimes, and we're--

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
babies, I mean, we

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.790 align:middle line:84%
learn how to first
hold onto things.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when a parent says
let go and the baby cannot let

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.160 align:middle line:84%
go, it's because in the brain,
it has not yet registered what

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:90%
letting go means.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And then you see the
baby grow a little,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and they learn how to let go.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.240 align:middle line:90%
And then anything--

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's my problem.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Anything you give
them just drops down.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So I could say that my
life has been the fine art

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.680 align:middle line:84%
of knowing what to hold
down and what to let go.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> When to fold them.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.300 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.967 align:middle line:84%
When to hold them and
when to fold them.

00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You've said, also, that
pain is a great teacher--

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.250 align:middle line:84%
not that we want to celebrate
our painful experiences,

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.070 align:middle line:84%
but to not perhaps
run away from them.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in my own experience,
and working with thousands

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
of people, one thing that
I have really seen is how,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:84%
when we reach a point
of our own brokenness--

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is different
for everybody.

00:05:59.455 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> For everybody, because
the threshold, the level,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
the whole tolerance level of
pain differs from one person

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But in that brokenness
is when you really

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:90%
experience your vulnerability.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But you also experience,
then, the everlasting arms,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
the sustaining force,
the life force within you

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:90%
that rises to a new level.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a known fact that in
situations of big crisis

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.910 align:middle line:84%
or drama, we suddenly produce
such strength that we never

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.250 align:middle line:90%
thought that we were capable of.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
So I could say that
every time that I

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
went to the end of my pain, I
discovered a new person in me.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:90%
And if I could--

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.785 align:middle line:84%
if I look back, I mean,
it's a known fact,

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:84%
a scientific fact that
all cells of our body

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.190 align:middle line:90%
constantly regenerate.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>> The hardest thing to
regenerate is our thought

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and feeling process, because
we get stuck with so many

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%
of the old thoughts.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
pain has always

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.495 align:middle line:84%
broken a belief system,
a belief pattern,

00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and has promoted me
to the next level.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And everybody that I look or
work with, it's the same thing.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:25.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, the wonderful thing is that
in the evolutionary process,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.980 align:middle line:84%
we are learning
that we can learn,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.442 align:middle line:84%
discover with less and less
pain, and faster and faster.

00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, with self-awareness.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.590 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the good news.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And everything that exists
today that makes us aware

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.870 align:middle line:90%
helps that process.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, Liliane, pain, too,
to someone or even to someone

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.400 align:middle line:10%
at a particular
time in their life,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:10%
what is painful to me today that
feels devastating would have

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:10%
been nothing years ago.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:90%
It took a two-by-four years ago.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.790 align:middle line:84%
Today, it can be my own thought
process that brings me--

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got to move from
this place to the next.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:90%
This is not comfortable for me.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And we are learning how to make
better choices, definitely,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:90%
and how not to be stuck.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Speak to that, the stuck
energy you talk about.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:84%
What we have known as
addictions is a lot broader now.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's been so
much talk, so much awareness,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
so many things
have been written.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Our entire health system is
now in a turmoil and changing.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Addictions have always been
looked at mainly in two

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
categories-- the substance
abuse addiction--

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:90%
alcoholism and drugs.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And there is a
whole war going on.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
We look at addictions truly
and genuinely as stuck energy

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:04.930 align:middle line:84%
and as deep attachment
that simply stops growth.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Addictions are so much wider
than what we have originally

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.480 align:middle line:90%
thought about the substance.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, drugs
and alcohol, they

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:84%
are still the
smallest proportion

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:84%
in our society of addictions,
although they are easily

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.370 align:middle line:90%
identifiable.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%
They are the evident one.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But process addiction,
whether it be co-dependency,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.810 align:middle line:84%
workaholism, sex addiction,
relationship addiction,

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:90%
gambling, spending--

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
compulsive spending--
computer addiction--

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Obsessing, too--

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Being addicted to
obsessing over something.

00:09:45.037 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>> You cannot be attached to
something as a belief that--

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.160 align:middle line:84%
because attachments
are belief systems

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
that this is what is
going to remove my pain.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And I will go and use
this over and over,

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
hoping to kill that
emptiness, that pain,

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%
or produce that euphoria.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> This may seem like a simple
question, but how do we know,

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.140 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, that we are in
that painful and stuck place?

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it just when we're
medicating, like you're saying?

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Or is there another way
for us to recognize that?

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what will happen
is that if you medicate long

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:84%
enough, you are inevitably
going to start experiencing

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:90%
the consequences of that.

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And your life is
going to get stuck.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:40.180 align:middle line:84%
Your relationships are
going to start to reflect.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:84%
Your level of
creativity will go down.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Your level of
energy will go down.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
You see, we can't,
anymore, think in terms

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.120 align:middle line:90%
of just mind, body, and spirit.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.720 align:middle line:84%
We have to think in
a greater sense--

00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:84%
mind, body, emotions, affect,
meaning all my belief systems,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
the way that I relate
in all relationships.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:90%
All of those are spirit.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You cannot separate
spirit from all of that.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe that,
too, that Wayne Dyer, Dr.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Wayne Dyer gave the biggest
gift to the 20th century.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.160 align:middle line:90%
He defined who we are.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
He defined that we are
spiritual beings having

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:90%
human experiences.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:90%
And most of the time--

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So everything is spirit.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
>> For all of us, what
happens is that we are first

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and foremost and
only human beings.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And we glorify ourselves
in our humanness,

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:84%
but which is also our biggest
addiction-- our goofiness.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, show me a
human and I'll show you,

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
every now and then, a
really cute, goofy person.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
The truth about us
is a much bigger one.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.070 align:middle line:90%
We are spiritual beings.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, that energy,
that spiritual energy,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.990 align:middle line:90%
is in every aspect.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't treat, anymore, just
disease from the physical point

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:90%
or from the biological point.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:84%
You have to consider
the whole thing.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the exciting things
in my work is that precisely we

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:23.540 align:middle line:84%
are a holistic model
working with the affect,

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:90%
meaning all the belief systems.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:90%
You know that original imprint?

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> We have, the old saying is,
we have been made and created

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.060 align:middle line:84%
in the image and likeness of
God or our creator or a higher

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But ever since, humanity
has been paying the tribute

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:90%
to God the other way, OK?

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
And we have been
imprinted by our families,

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.770 align:middle line:84%
by our society,
education, religion,

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.808 align:middle line:90%
with a fear-based paradigm.

00:12:56.808 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to need to
take a break right now,

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
but when we come back, let's
talk more specifically about

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
what we do look for in ourself
and how these addictions play

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.670 align:middle line:90%
out in our own mind.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.850 align:middle line:84%
You are watching the
"World of Wisdom."

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft, speaking with
Liliane Desjardins of Pavillon

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:90%
International.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.845 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back to
a "World of Wisdom."

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft, speaking
with Liliane Desjardins.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And right before the
break, we touched

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:90%
on the addictions that--

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:84%
there's a distinction between
the different addictions now.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.748 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not just
drugs and alcohol.

00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
there is, like I

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.977 align:middle line:84%
said at the beginning,
substance addiction.

00:13:37.977 --> 00:13:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And then there are
process addictions.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.870 align:middle line:84%
Co-dependency-- I
mean, that attachment

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.820 align:middle line:84%
to another person,
where my value comes

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:50.030 align:middle line:84%
from another person, where my
whole being is being measured

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
from the outside by what others
approve, disapprove, and so

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:90%
on for me.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Workaholism and all the sex
addiction, food addiction--

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, eating disorders.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.762 align:middle line:84%
These are the
process addictions.

00:14:03.762 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:90%
You know, you live with them.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to learn
how to transform that.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But the research today,
and our own experience

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.910 align:middle line:84%
of working with people,
has brought through it,

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to our attention,
that underlying

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.970 align:middle line:84%
all of the substance
and process addictions

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:90%
are the core addictions.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And the core addictions--
the three core addictions

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:84%
are power control,
security, and sensation.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are the paradigms
that are fear-based.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.140 align:middle line:84%
These are the paradigms
that have gone away

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.960 align:middle line:84%
from the principles on
which you and me were

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:90%
designed to originally operate.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> As a spiritual being.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> As a spiritual being.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:84%
>> See, we are supposed to be
anchored in principles of truth

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:00.360 align:middle line:84%
And when that is replaced and
when we become, progressively,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
a society that is
fear-based, you're

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.600 align:middle line:90%
going to have consequences.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Security addiction
is that deep belief,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:90%
deep paradigm in scarcity.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
not-enough syndrome,

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.870 align:middle line:90%
in which you are not enough.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not enough.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.705 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough of anything.

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:18.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Of anything.

00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:19.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:19.095 --> 00:15:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> You never do enough.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
You are simply somehow
at fault. And that's

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:90%
when toxic shame comes in.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's when competition and
control and a craving for power

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Hazel Henderson calls that
working from the reptilian

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:90%
brain.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is, in many ways,
like we collectively

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:48.750 align:middle line:84%
run on a programming and a disk
that was manufactured centuries

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.550 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're still
using it in 1997.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you look around
us today, addictions

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:90%
are not just a myth or a rumor.

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The divorce rate, the
dismantling of our families,

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
the pain in the working
place, in our corporations--

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.075 align:middle line:90%
>> From not coming from center.

00:16:11.075 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> From center, for not
coming from principles,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:84%
but coming from fear-based
paradigms that then produce

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:84%
behaviors that are either, I
gotta win and you gotta lose,

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
or the victim syndrome, where I
am always the loser and you are

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:90%
the winner.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:34.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Or we both lose, because we
go into destructive behaviors.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And we have become a society
of instant gratification,

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:90%
because addictions stop growth.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.760 align:middle line:84%
And when you stop
growing emotionally,

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't care how much
you progress in knowledge

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and intellectual understanding.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.090 align:middle line:90%
They are not connected.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have to
treat the whole person.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Your mind needs to know
where your emotions are,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.579 align:middle line:84%
because if it does not, your
body is going to reflect it.

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Behavior is at four levels--

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
thinking, feeling, doing,
and physiologically.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we don't deal with
consciously, our bodies deal.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.790 align:middle line:90%
And look--

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Disease--

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.904 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:19.740 align:middle line:90%
>> --and pain.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Disease, pain,
disruption of relationships.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:27.319 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so easy, too, to blame
that on the outside world.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.755 align:middle line:84%
>> But the new paradigm, what
I'm hearing is that we are

00:17:30.755 --> 00:17:31.555 align:middle line:90%
shifting.

00:17:31.555 --> 00:17:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to go back
to-- we are shifting.

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.870 align:middle line:84%
There is treatment
for addictions

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:90%
when they are advanced.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.220 align:middle line:84%
But I truly believe that the
next millennium is calling

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.350 align:middle line:90%
all of us to one thing--

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
more of the self awareness,
a return to the divine in us.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:90%
A return--

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I love Larry Gatlin.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:90%
He's a great friend.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And he relates so well the story
that Emmett Fox talked about

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:90%
in his book.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
In Africa, they used to find
diamonds in the yellow clay.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, somebody
realized that if you dig deeper

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:84%
and you go into the
blue clay, you're

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:90%
going to find the Hope Diamond.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.970 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
a Kimberley Diamond.

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that we
are at an incredible time

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.250 align:middle line:90%
in human development.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.910 align:middle line:84%
We are going within,
because we have tried,

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.810 align:middle line:84%
especially on this continent,
we have tried everything

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:35.630 align:middle line:84%
that we could from the outside
to fill that hole, that

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:84%
emptiness that happens
when we are no more

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:90%
anchored in principles.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, too, Liliane,
when you were talking about

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
the instant gratification,
it just occurred to me that

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.430 align:middle line:84%
the attachments or
addictive behavior,

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:84%
the stuck energy is that which
keeps us truly from inner

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.630 align:middle line:90%
instant gratification.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> That we can't really get
instant gratification until we

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
look at that, when you
remove those blocks.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, because you
can't connect to the spirit.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some
of the ways that--

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:84%
I know in your own treatment
and renewal center that you do--

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.632 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the ways that
we can remove those blocks

00:19:16.632 --> 00:19:17.840 align:middle line:90%
and take a look at ourselves?

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, if
we're talking about being

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
in a treatment and
renewal center, as I said,

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.530 align:middle line:84%
we really work with all the
aspects of the human mind,

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:90%
body, emotions, and affect.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And we go back and look
at what are our paradigms.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:90%
What is the belief system?

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Because again, you can
work on behavior for years.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
Unless you change the
paradigm, nothing changes.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:53.660 align:middle line:84%
We, in our own homes
today, can do one thing.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:90%
To which talk are you listening?

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.510 align:middle line:90%
We all have our inner talk.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And one voice is going to tell
you, you're not good enough,

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
you don't measure up, and all
of these wonderful things.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And we listen to
our horror movies.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.210 align:middle line:84%
What do we do with a TV
program we don't like?

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.800 align:middle line:90%
We change the channel.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But we never think of
changing our inner channel.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
And unless we start
putting in affirmations,

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:84%
positive self-talk, and
we start asking ourselves,

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
what is it that makes me
run, why am I doing this,

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
why am I in this relationship,
why am I acting the way I am--

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, too, it's in that
instant that change is made.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And Wayne Dyer speaks to
this, too-- in that instant.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
the hardest thing

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:84%
you can think about
doing in that instant.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The easiest thing is to
continue thinking the way you

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:50.230 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:50.605 --> 00:20:51.620 align:middle line:90%
>> In that moment--

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Thinking that somebody else
is responsible for the way you

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.810 align:middle line:84%
feel and something else out
there is making it that way.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:03.530 align:middle line:84%
When you go in as
you are the problem,

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:84%
you become the solution,
because in that moment,

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.790 align:middle line:90%
you are no more in the past.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:10.570 align:middle line:90%
You are no more in the future.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:12.180 align:middle line:90%
You are in the now in your life.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the only place that
it happens, in the now.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And being aware in that now--

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:84%
the mindfulness, the being
alive, awake, and present.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:90%
Medicators numb us.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Medicators keep us in the past.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Medicators project
us in the future.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And medicators
look like what?

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:84%
Obviously they look
like drugs and alcohol.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Medicators can
look like anything.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I have seen people who have made
out of exercise the medicator

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.580 align:middle line:90%
that replaced the food.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:53.210 align:middle line:90%
There is a balance in between.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Medicators can be work, other
people, success, power, money,

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.480 align:middle line:90%
sex, drugs, alcohol.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Shopping.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Shopping.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.250 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Internet.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Anything that becomes
the tool that you

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:84%
use to deal with inner
turmoil, with inner pain,

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:84%
with that nagging feeling
that you are not enough,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
that you don't have
enough, that you don't have

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.530 align:middle line:84%
enough control, that you don't
have enough power, that you

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:84%
don't count, because the
conflict between security

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.710 align:middle line:84%
addiction and power
addiction produces the pain.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
sensation addiction sets in.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.140 align:middle line:84%
That means I can't deal with
this inside comfortably.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Can't breathe into it,
sit, and just be with it.

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>> So I need--

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Got to cover it up.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> --to cover it up.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.340 align:middle line:90%
I need to kill the pain.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for being with us today.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, good luck with
what you guys are doing here.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.250 align:middle line:84%
This is incredible that you
are bringing the good news

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:56.940 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Need that.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for joining
us on a "World of Wisdom."

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been speaking
with Liliane Desjardins

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.890 align:middle line:90%
of Pavillon International.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for joining us.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.952 align:middle line:90%
