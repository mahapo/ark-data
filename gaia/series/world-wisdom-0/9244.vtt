00:01:09.493 --> 00:01:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to a
"World of Wisdom."

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are responding
to a time of change.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.800 align:middle line:84%
The year 1998 has been
predicted to disengage us

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.790 align:middle line:84%
from the limits of our
past in profound ways

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.700 align:middle line:84%
according to the famous
prophecy of Edgar Cayce

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:84%
and related to us
today by my guest.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:84%
If you have felt saddened
or overwhelmed at times

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.580 align:middle line:84%
over the state of our
world, you're not alone.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.430 align:middle line:84%
Lecturer and author
Dr. Mark Thurston

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:84%
is a leading expert in the
teachings and philosophy

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:90%
of Edgar Cayce.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.050 align:middle line:84%
He's also executive director of
the Edgar Cayce organization.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear what promising
news he has to share.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.043 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Mark Thurston.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:50.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carolyn.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It's good to be here.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for
being here with us.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.110 align:middle line:84%
I've got a couple of
books on the desk,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
but you have written,
I think, over 20.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I've written 16 books that
are based on concepts in Edgar

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:90%
Cayce's readings.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And I try to draw on
other material too.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I know one of the
most profound one

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.850 align:middle line:84%
and probably the way that
Edgar Cayce is most known

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
is from his prophecies,
and a lot of the things

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.980 align:middle line:84%
that he saw in his visions
coming true over the 20 years

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.260 align:middle line:84%
since his death
and prior to that.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.690 align:middle line:84%
The one in particular, the
"Millennium Prophecies,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Predictions for the Coming
Century from Edgar Cayce."

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is your book
that you put together.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, just published recently.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:10%
Probably Edgar Cayce's
material about holistic health

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:10%
and his predictions about
the late 20th century

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:10%
and into the 21st century
are the parts of his material

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:10%
that are most famous.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:10%
Although, when I ask people,
how many readings do you think

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.500 align:middle line:10%
Edgar Cayce gave on
prophecy and prediction?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:84%
They always guess far more
than he actually gave.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:90%
It's only about two dozen.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's something
like 2/10 of 1%

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
of all of his psychic
intuitive work

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.640 align:middle line:84%
had to do with predictions
for the future.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Now most of his work is
available to anyone, I know,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:90%
through the foundation.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:10%
Many of his writings,
they are compiled

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:10%
in some form of book one
book after the other,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.690 align:middle line:10%
and you've taken the
millennium prophecies

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:10%
and condensed some of the
things of the future view?

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the great spiritual
teachers of the 20th century

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:84%
have presented their
material in different ways.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And for Edgar Cayce,
it was a matter

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
of individual
people coming to him

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:90%
asking for spiritual advice.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
And the answers that he
gave, and the discourses

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
that he presented were recorded
stenographically, and then

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.040 align:middle line:90%
typed up.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And we had more recently put
them into digitized forms.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.110 align:middle line:90%
They're even on a CD-ROM.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And then over the years, as we
have categorized the material

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and indexed it, it's made
it possible for many authors

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.730 align:middle line:84%
and many lecturers and workshop
leaders to take those ideas

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.770 align:middle line:84%
and to present them
in ways that make

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:90%
them relevant to today's world.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's pretty much what
you've done with this book.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>> With this particular book
on millennium prophecies,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I've focused on the predictions
he made about outer changes

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
in the world, geological
changes, political changes,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.460 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
But half of the book is
about the inner changes

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that he said people
would go through as we

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:90%
move into the 21st century.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about, I know the
prediction about the Earth

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:84%
totally changing, and you see
some of the states have fallen

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
off.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.710 align:middle line:84%
That can be a real
scary to some people.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But I know in your
book in particular,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.340 align:middle line:84%
you say its purpose is to
provide hope, understanding,

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and creative alternatives
for empowerment.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.807 align:middle line:84%
Is this how you see the intent
underneath the writings here?

00:04:44.807 --> 00:04:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, his statements
about Earth changes,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:84%
that have gained a lot of
attention are probably going

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.240 align:middle line:84%
to get a lot of attention as
we move towards 2000 and 2001,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.520 align:middle line:84%
have sometimes been
misinterpreted and even

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:90%
reformatted by the media.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
He always said, in
describing these Earth

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:84%
changes or earthquakes
and volcanoes,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.020 align:middle line:84%
that it was possible,
even likely,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:84%
but the future is not fixed, and
that human behavior as well as

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.220 align:middle line:84%
human thought and emotion
would shape the future, even

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.070 align:middle line:84%
the geological future
for our planet.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:84%
Now even some of the
predictions he made,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
in their most dire
description, don't necessarily

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:84%
talk about parts of the
United States falling off.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.460 align:middle line:84%
There are references to
parts of California being

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:90%
inundated after earthquakes.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
There are references to
parts of the Carolinas, parts

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:90%
of Alabama being inundated.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.032 align:middle line:84%
A description in one
reading about New York City

00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:40.490 align:middle line:84%
being destroyed,
although it wasn't

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.340 align:middle line:84%
clear any particular
timing for that.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.520 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
way into the future.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.910 align:middle line:84%
It isn't clear whether he
meant by a tidal wave or war

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.780 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's always this element
of free will that's there.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And like any prophet,
and if we look

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.020 align:middle line:84%
at the meaning of a prophet in
the Old Testament, for example,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.390 align:middle line:84%
it was always to say, here's
what's going to happen,

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
unless the people do
something different.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And the most famous
story is Jonah, not

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
the whale part of
the story, but where

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Jonah goes to the people
of Nineveh, and he says,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.203 align:middle line:84%
the city will be destroyed,
unless you make some changes.

00:06:17.203 --> 00:06:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And they listened to
what he was saying.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:90%
And they made changes.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.050 align:middle line:90%
And there was no destruction.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, Jonah sort
of felt embarrassed

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
because these things
didn't happen.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But that's really biblical
prophecy in the truest sense.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, if we want
to call Edgar Cayce a prophet,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and he never called
himself that,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
it was always a describer
or what might happen,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.130 align:middle line:84%
unless we used our free will
to build a better future.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Even in looking at this from
an even larger perspective,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
the Edgar Cayce's, the
prophets of our past,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.050 align:middle line:84%
aren't they also allowing us
to expand our own potential,

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to know that we do have access
to psychic abilities within

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.830 align:middle line:90%
ourselves?

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
We do have access to
that cosmic record

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
to know what could be
happening in our own life?

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, Edgar Cayce
said about his own intuitive

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
abilities that we have those
same abilities within ourselves

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
and that we could
do what he did.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's
diagnosing ailments,

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.880 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's looking
into a likely future,

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
interpreting a dream,

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that anyone could do
what he was doing.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.400 align:middle line:84%
But then he added
on a little caveat,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
if you're willing
to pay the price.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the price is not a tuition
to any conference or a fee

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:90%
to get into a school.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a price in
terms of self change.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there also a price
in, I think, humility?

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Or at times when you may not
be hearing the voice of wisdom,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
but you're hearing the voice
of your ego or something

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.050 align:middle line:90%
to really know the difference?

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.310 align:middle line:84%
And discernment and
spiritual guidance, I think,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:90%
is a crucial issue.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I would predict, here I'm
going to be a prophet,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I would predict in
the 21st century

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
as more people become
innately intuitive

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
and as this faculty of
intuition becomes more widely

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.700 align:middle line:84%
available to people
that this issue of how

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
we discern our personality, our
ego, our self desires, and how

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.830 align:middle line:84%
that mingles in with
authentic guidance,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
discern and sort that out

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to be a very,
very important issue.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
that's what I get.

00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:28.140 align:middle line:84%
I have read some original
works, the Edgar Cayce works.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think one can get
caught up in the drama

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.600 align:middle line:84%
or whether he was
right or wrong.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
Or anybody that's successful in
their art or in tune with them

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:40.590 align:middle line:90%
self, we can nip away at them.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But I really got from
the millennium processes

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
a lot of hope out
here and how we

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:84%
can put on this new way
of being, the Christed

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
one, the anointed one,
the spiritual self.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Cayce was really an
ecumenical figure who thought

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:90%
in terms of global spirituality.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
In his personal life, he
was Christian, Protestant.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet, as he
spoke of the Christ,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:84%
it was always this universal
Christ consciousness

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:90%
that lives in every person.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And he always described it in
terms of a theme of oneness.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And as he talked about
the 21st century,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.880 align:middle line:84%
it was that the
principle of oneness

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.330 align:middle line:84%
would be the guiding light
for humanity in politics,

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.090 align:middle line:84%
in religion, in art,
and spirituality

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.930 align:middle line:84%
that we would discover and wake
up to our interconnectedness.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
little signs of that

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.730 align:middle line:84%
already in economics
and science and weather.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And we could go on
and on with a list

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
of how humanity is realizing
our interconnectedness.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:84%
And in religion as
well, we need to find

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
this thread of oneness that
runs through all the faith

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And I believe that's a
big part of what he did do,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.388 align:middle line:90%
as many.

00:09:50.388 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
During the turn of
the century, there

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
was the Emily Cadys and
the Charles Fillmores

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
and a number of
enlightened beings

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that brought this new way
of being to the planet.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And now their writings,
we hold very, very sacred.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And these classic teachers,
if we think about the first

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.250 align:middle line:84%
half of the 20th
century, I think,

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
provided an extraordinary
foundation for us.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
I would add to your list, Carl
Jung's work, Rudolf Steiner,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Dispenza and Gurdjieff
perhaps, and others as well.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And we have this
wonderful foundation.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I think now we're challenged
to translate those principles

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
into what it's like to live in
the late 20th century and early

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:90%
21st.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think maybe when
we think about skeptics

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.690 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, that may be
where the line is drawn,

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's often to talk about
them or to look at their life

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and not really understand that
they're giving us wonderful

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.970 align:middle line:84%
insights into how to live our
own life and the challenges

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that we face and becoming those
principles on a day to day

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:90%
basis.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's be skeptical.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's be willing to be
skeptical if it means putting

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
the principles to a
test in our own lives.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.310 align:middle line:84%
When Edgar Cayce named his
own organization back in 1931,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
it was the Association for
Research and Enlightenment.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.000 align:middle line:84%
People want to do the
enlightenment work.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.375 align:middle line:84%
And they don't want to do the
application and the testing

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:84%
and the research to
see if the ideas work.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And so if skeptical
means, I'm not really

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
going to fully believe it until
I know it works in my own life,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.980 align:middle line:84%
then we need to have that
kind of healthy skepticism.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And allow ourselves
to risk and fail.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in studying,
reading about Edgar Cayce,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:84%
not only reading what he
said, but about his own life,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.030 align:middle line:84%
he was picking himself
up on a regular basis.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.420 align:middle line:84%
He was failing or falling
and then picking himself up.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:48.790 align:middle line:84%
And he had a human life as Jesus
the man did even though there

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
was this divine
part of him that was

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:90%
very much a inspiration to us.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think Edgar Cayce's
failures were probably in two

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:90%
categories.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.135 align:middle line:84%
There were times
where he just couldn't

00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.480 align:middle line:90%
give accurate psychic readings.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And hunting for oil with the
intention of that money funding

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.805 align:middle line:90%
a hospital someday.

00:12:05.805 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
That was a good intention,
but it just didn't work.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And there were other areas
where he seemed to fail.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.050 align:middle line:84%
But other kind of failing
was having people not

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
believe in him and
how discouraging it

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
was to be thrown in jail in
New York City for fortune

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
telling, to be thrown
in jail in Detroit

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.650 align:middle line:84%
for practicing medicine
without a license.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Those were tough times for
him and for his family.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the
risk, isn't it?

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:84%
When we do follow
our inner guidance,

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.990 align:middle line:84%
it may not be accepted by
everybody around us or society.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.150 align:middle line:84%
But we're moving more
in that direction,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I agree with you, that
we can go by intuition

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.362 align:middle line:90%
and our inner wisdom.

00:12:41.362 --> 00:12:43.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
You're watching a
"World of Wisdom."

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with
Dr. mark Thurston

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.690 align:middle line:84%
the author of
"Millennium Prophecies,"

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.620 align:middle line:84%
"Synchronicity as Spiritual
Guidance," and 14 more, right?

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:90%
There are 16.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
talking with him more

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.090 align:middle line:90%
in the next few moments.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:06.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking with Dr.
Mark Thurston, the author

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
of "Millennium Prophecies,
Predictions for the Coming

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Century from Edgar Cayce."

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And during the break, we talked
about maybe taking a moment

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:84%
to share the story, the dream
that Edgar Cayce had that

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:90%
took him way into his future.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Edgar Cayce had been arrested
for practicing medicine without

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:84%
a license in Detroit
and thrown into jail.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And as it turned out, he
was eventually released.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:10%
And on the train
ride back home, going

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:10%
to Virginia Beach from
Detroit, at a time

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.020 align:middle line:10%
when he was very
discouraged in his life,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.773 align:middle line:10%
not too much earlier, maybe
just a couple of years earlier,

00:13:45.773 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:10%
he had lost this
hospital that had

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:10%
been built, where people
came for treatment using

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:10%
his suggestions.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:10%
And so at this downtime in
his life, he has a dream.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:10%
In the dream, he
has been born again.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.220 align:middle line:10%
It's the year 2158.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:10%
And as a young boy, he remembers
having been Edgar Cayce

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.600 align:middle line:10%
in a previous lifetime.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And he tells people about
this, and he interests

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
some scientists
in investigating.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And they take him
in what he describes

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.330 align:middle line:84%
in the dream as a cigar
shaped like flying vehicle

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:84%
all over the Eastern United
States flying by the places he

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.440 align:middle line:84%
remembered he had lived as
Edgar Cayce in Alabama and Ohio

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:90%
and Kentucky.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:84%
They go by New
York City, where he

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
sees that it's being rebuilt
after having been destroyed.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:84%
As he looks down, he
sees the people largely

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
live in glass homes,
that industries

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:90%
have been decentralized.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And they land in Virginia
Beach, and they're

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.150 align:middle line:84%
able to find the records
of his work as Edgar Cayce

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:90%
from 200 years earlier.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:84%
Now after that dream, he
gets back to Virginia Beach.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
In a reading some
months later, they

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.110 align:middle line:84%
ask for the dream
to be interpreted.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And from this unconscious
state from which

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.600 align:middle line:84%
his own intuitive
wisdom came, he said,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.330 align:middle line:84%
it really has two
interpretations.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.090 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it's come at
this very discouraging time

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
in your life to encourage you
and to say that your work will

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:07.680 align:middle line:90%
be remembered.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.670 align:middle line:90%
It will last.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Secondly, some of the things
that you've seen here may well

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:90%
come to pass.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:84%
It may well be that
Nebraska, where

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.540 align:middle line:84%
you were born in this dream,
may be a seacoast are.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
Whether that's an inland sea,
or, heaven forbid the thought,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.980 align:middle line:84%
the Pacific Ocean coming that
far is left rather ambiguous.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
That New York may in fact
go through a destruction

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.690 align:middle line:84%
and have to be
rebuilt. That this kind

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
of decentralization
of civilization

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
in terms of our industries
may in fact take place.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.512 align:middle line:90%
But the future is not fixed.

00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:44.970 align:middle line:84%
It always has that
little tag line,

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.520 align:middle line:84%
we are co-creating the
future even right now.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And what a gift to receive
that at that time when he was

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:90%
so distraught.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that often when we do get
that dream or that vision that

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.800 align:middle line:84%
gives us hope when
we may have given up?

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And the dark night of the
soul is when the light is born

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to touch again on a
little bit on the geographical

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.440 align:middle line:90%
changes versus consciousness.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:84%
How do you see, if
the skeptics only

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.768 align:middle line:84%
go into the literal
interpretations,

00:16:13.768 --> 00:16:15.810 align:middle line:84%
well, this didn't happen,
and this didn't happen.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And we can't operate
our life thinking

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.198 align:middle line:84%
that the coast is
going to end up here.

00:16:20.198 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to them
about consciousness

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:90%
and how that relates?

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that some of the
visionary experiences Edgar

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:32.370 align:middle line:84%
Cayce had about Earth changes
needed to be interpreted

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
through his own mind and
his own understanding.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, this was in
the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Frankly, this is my own
personal interpretation,

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I believe that part
of what he was seeing

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.980 align:middle line:84%
was the ecological crisis
that we have right now.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.750 align:middle line:84%
And that there was no signs
of ecology at the time.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And to a certain extent,
seeing volcanoes or earthquakes

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:84%
or tidal waves was
imagery that was saying,

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.160 align:middle line:84%
the Earth will shake humanity
back to a new sense of itself

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
and its relationship
to the Earth.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And frankly, many
of the Earth changes

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
that he said might
well happen by 1998

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:90%
don't seem to be happening.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're going through
the very kinds of consciousness

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:90%
changes that he predicted.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, I think,
even in a metaphorical way,

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:84%
certain processes
have come true.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:23.520 align:middle line:84%
He said, for example, the
greater portion of Japan

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.770 align:middle line:90%
would have to go into the sea.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.790 align:middle line:84%
Now that prophecy
was given in 1935.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
I believe what he
was seeing had to do

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.050 align:middle line:84%
with the political structure
of Japan at the time.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And he was seeing that
the expansionistic ideals

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and purposes that
the government had

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.793 align:middle line:84%
had the seeds of its own
destruction right there.

00:17:43.793 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And that that whole
way of living,

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.150 align:middle line:84%
that government, that
national intention

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:84%
was going to have
to come to naught.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Now there are going
to be earthquakes

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
in Tokyo and throughout
Japan just because it's

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.415 align:middle line:90%
right there on the rim of fire.

00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It didn't take a psychic
to say that Japan's

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:90%
vulnerable to earthquakes.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:84%
But I was in Japan just
a couple of months ago.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And that was the number one
question they were asking me.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Will the processes about
Japan going into the sea

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.852 align:middle line:90%
necessarily happen?

00:18:09.852 --> 00:18:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said to them, I think
that prophecy has already

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.700 align:middle line:84%
been fulfilled in a
more metaphorical way

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.580 align:middle line:84%
having to do with the
end of World War II.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, and when we
receive a premonition,

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:84%
we have the opportunity to
either see things rightly,

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.380 align:middle line:84%
set things rightly, or
whatever, or we can succumb

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:90%
to that we're powerless.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hearing is that
we can make the decision

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to interpret that
metaphorically and/or really

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.790 align:middle line:84%
literally do something about
the gift of precognition.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the danger of
people Cayce's processes

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
or Nostradamus or anybody
is the sense of doom

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:84%
or that somehow or
other it's set in stone.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned something
also in your book

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
about with the birth
of the new millennium,

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.910 align:middle line:84%
there are many people are
unaware of what's happening.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And you say that
vibrate, to be or I think

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.360 align:middle line:84%
this is a direct quote
from Edgar Cayce,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.960 align:middle line:84%
to be mindful of the
vibratory influences

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have with one
another or that someone else

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.880 align:middle line:90%
has when they're present.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Could you elaborate
a little bit on that?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm trained
as a psychologist.

00:19:22.283 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm more interested in the
psychology of changing times

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.550 align:middle line:90%
than I am the geology.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think that a
sensitivity to each other,

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.340 align:middle line:84%
whether that's vibrations
that are sensed,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
or whether we're talking about
telepathic contact that becomes

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
more natural, or
whether we're talking

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.890 align:middle line:84%
about more of a sense of being
a global family, all of these

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:84%
are psychological changes
that he said right

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
at the turn of the century
would become paramount.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he said 1998
would be the turning point

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:84%
year for humanity in
terms of understanding.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
That would be the year in
which humanity as a whole--

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Gets it.

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>> --would finally begin, yeah,
would finally get it of what

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.850 align:middle line:84%
these changing times
have been all about.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:84%
How do you see that translating
in your own life 1998?

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.010 align:middle line:84%
A New Year's resolution in 1998,
has that made a difference?

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the way each of us
meets these interchanges has

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
to do with several
different dynamics.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
One is how we deal
with our own limits.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:84%
We all experience the limits
of time, sometimes money,

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:90%
sometimes health or energy.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we confront
limits, it either

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
brings out the best in
us or the worst in us.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of what's going
on for these four decades

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
that Cayce said would be such
a time of tumultuous change

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.790 align:middle line:84%
on our planet has
to do with how we

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.040 align:middle line:84%
deal with limits, at
a collective level,

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.430 align:middle line:90%
at a personal level.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're receiving that
from a lot of the prophets,

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
living or having made
their transition,

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
the same thing that this is a
real time going towards the new

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.260 align:middle line:90%
millennium.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is about the inner
choices that we are making,

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.290 align:middle line:84%
not just what happened to
us or what is in our past,

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:07.890 align:middle line:84%
but it's about how we're going
to create the future that we

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:08.740 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And that little item of
decision making is really

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:90%
my second point.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:90%
Limits in the decision making.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.290 align:middle line:84%
We have in our society,
I think, a tendency

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.780 align:middle line:84%
to think in terms of
winning the lottery

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.810 align:middle line:84%
or hitting a home or
some big thing that

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.320 align:middle line:84%
in a almost precipitous
way changes everything.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And probably more
often, the way change

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:84%
is effected is step by
step, or as Cayce put it,

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:90%
line upon line.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it's in
those little changes

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.680 align:middle line:84%
of how we react when
somebody pulls in front of us

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.170 align:middle line:84%
on the highway or when
we have to stand in line

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:84%
a little longer than we thought,
it those little changes that

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:46.830 align:middle line:84%
really reflect whether or not
a new consciousness is coming.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see it
changing on the planet?

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.010 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's many hopeful
signs, many hopeful signs.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily
look in Newsweek or Time

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Magazine or the
network evening news

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.480 align:middle line:90%
to get the signs of change.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.510 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes, we have
to look beneath the surface.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:04.980 align:middle line:84%
We have to look in
our own families

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and our own communities to see
these more hopeful indicators.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Our time is up.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a privilege
talking with you.

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:13.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I know our viewers are
going to enjoy looking further

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and studying further with
not only Edgar Cayce,

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
but the works that you and your
associates have put together.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You've been watching
the 'World of Wisdom."

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I've been speaking
with Dr. Mark Thurston.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of "Millennium
Prophecies, Predictions

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.130 align:middle line:84%
for the Coming Century
from Edgar Cayce"

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.390 align:middle line:90%
and a number of other books.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And we give our thanks
for you being here today.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.840 align:middle line:10%
Thanks for joining us.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.827 align:middle line:90%
