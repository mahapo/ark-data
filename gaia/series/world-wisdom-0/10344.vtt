00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:03.451 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft, and welcome
to "A World of Wisdom."

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.515 align:middle line:84%
My guests today
are an inspiration.

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:36.200 align:middle line:84%
They are living their
passion as their work.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:10%
Together, for over 25 years--
they are in their 26th year

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:10%
now--

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:10%
they have co-produced
"New Dimensions"

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:10%
syndicated radio talk show.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:10%
It is heard in over 300 markets.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And they have now shared their
experience of working together

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
in passion in a new book
entitled "True Work:

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.230 align:middle line:84%
The Sacred Dimension
of Earning a Living."

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And as I said earlier,
this book will touch--

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.010 align:middle line:84%
is touching lives in a way
that brings passion to our work

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and healing to our
spiritual-- sometimes

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.800 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual blockage.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
We are learning how to be more
passionate about what we do,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:90%
and more creative.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
My pleasure to welcome
Michael and Justine Toms.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much, Carolyn.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Carolyn.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to be here.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought we might begin
this time together with a little

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.940 align:middle line:84%
idea of why people
are dissatisfied,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.000 align:middle line:84%
where have we come from, and
where are we seeking to go

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.030 align:middle line:90%
in the workplace.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It's changing a
great deal out there.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.150 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think, Carolyn,
that people are really hungry

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:10%
for more meaning and
purpose in their lives,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:10%
and especially in their work.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.410 align:middle line:10%
As we continue to
pursue this bottom line,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.400 align:middle line:10%
business-as-usual
mentality around work,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:10%
something essential
is being trampled.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's that
something essential

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.590 align:middle line:84%
that we've written
about in "True Work."

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:84%
It's a deep longing
that each of us

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.870 align:middle line:84%
has to bring our
gifts to the world,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.800 align:middle line:84%
to make our contribution,
to serve others.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has a longing
to want to do something,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:84%
and to give the gift that
each of us has uniquely.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:90%
All of us are originals.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:90%
Each one of us is original.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.860 align:middle line:90%
There's only one Carolyn Craft.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.400 align:middle line:90%
There's only one Justine Toms.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.850 align:middle line:90%
There's only one.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, we're
here to give who we are

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.270 align:middle line:90%
and what we are.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very important
to follow that longing

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and have it lead us where
it wants to lead us.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I had the thought,
too, of letting go of mom

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
and dad's and grandmom and
granddad's expectations,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.270 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
That it's not about 40
years in one place anymore.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it truly has
changed, hasn't it?

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.050 align:middle line:10%
People change jobs now.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:10%
There is no job security
as once was touted,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:10%
that everything--
with downsizing

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.600 align:middle line:10%
now, with the workplace changing
so much, new kinds of work

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.400 align:middle line:10%
is coming up.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:84%
There are all sorts of
new professions now.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a good side of it.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.900 align:middle line:10%
We've noticed in
people that we've

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:10%
talked to who have
been downsized,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:10%
who are no longer
working, they've

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:10%
found that this is a very
special time for them,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:10%
that now they get
to choose again.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they might not
have had quite the gumption

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
or the courage to kind
of leap out there,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.590 align:middle line:90%
yet they may have wanted to.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.390 align:middle line:90%
And now, what?

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:90%
The worst has happened.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.938 align:middle line:90%
Here they are.

00:03:40.938 --> 00:03:42.480 align:middle line:84%
They're out there
on their own again.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And many of them are looking
at that in such a way as

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.670 align:middle line:84%
to choose again, and choose it
the way they really want it.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
To choose what has
meaning for them,

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:84%
to choose from their
own sense of values.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You had, Michael--

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I know it's written about in the
very beginning of "True Work"--

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
an experience at
a very early age.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me, in reading
the book, that I personally

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
felt touched in that it
affirmed my life and the changes

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:90%
that I've made.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.770 align:middle line:84%
You can see the tapestry
interwoven through--

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.500 align:middle line:84%
your whole life counts
in what you do today.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And you had an early
experience that

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.610 align:middle line:90%
shaped what you are doing now.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the experience
you're talking about is when I

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.270 align:middle line:90%
was five years old.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I was with my grandfather,
who I called Pop.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:90%
He called me Gus.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:90%
And I love my grandfather.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
He was one of my mentors
and one of my teachers.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I was five, and I had
gotten up with him

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
to help him make his
breakfast and to make lunch--

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
to pack his lunch for
going off to work.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:84%
He was a plate
printer at the Bureau

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.490 align:middle line:84%
of Engraving and
Printing, where they make

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:90%
paper money in Washington, DC.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
And I remember that he--

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
in this particular morning, he
bumped his head on a cabinet

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
above the sink, and he
was complaining, virulent.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Also complaining about
having to go to work.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And I remember hearing him just
be vociferous and very out loud

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:84%
about his reluctance
to go to work.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.287 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear that
he didn't like the idea.

00:05:15.287 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And I remember thinking at the
time that whenever I have to go

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to work at some
point in my life,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:84%
that I would want it to be work
that I didn't feel badly about,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.793 align:middle line:84%
that it would be work that
I would want to go to.

00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
the seed, I think,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:84%
that got planted at an
early age in my life,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:84%
that whatever work I did,
I wanted to enjoy it.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would not take work
that I did not enjoy or didn't

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.570 align:middle line:90%
get pleasure from.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And sometimes
following our passion,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.390 align:middle line:84%
really listening to
that inner voice,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.420 align:middle line:84%
means we're going to have
maybe not the cooperation

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:90%
of everybody around us.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.772 align:middle line:84%
I know when I quit the
corporation I've been with

00:05:51.772 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:84%
for eight years in my late 20s,
neither of my grandparents--

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
my grandmother, who worked for
the telephone company for 45

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.890 align:middle line:84%
years, and my grandfather,
who worked for the Bureau

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:84%
of Engraving or Printing for
the same amount of 45 years--

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.430 align:middle line:84%
they had no
understanding whatsoever

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
of what I was doing
in the sense of--

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:84%
it was like I was giving
up a career, to them.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.030 align:middle line:84%
To them, I was
giving up security.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>> You were nuts.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.570 align:middle line:90%
You were crazy.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't understand it.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't understand it.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.990 align:middle line:84%
In their world view,
there was no way

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:84%
for them to understand
what I was doing--

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:90%
to have room to understand.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.058 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't that
they loved me less.

00:06:26.058 --> 00:06:27.350 align:middle line:90%
And they were well-intentioned.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.030 align:middle line:90%
They cared about me.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:90%
But they couldn't understand.

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.480 align:middle line:84%
So if I needed their
approval, I wouldn't have--

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't have done it.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:84%
If I needed their approval--
waited for their approval,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.672 align:middle line:90%
I'd have never gotten it.

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't matter to me
whether they approved of it

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.140 align:middle line:84%
I knew inside myself that
that's what I had to do.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.940 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes we don't--

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if there's
the slightest doubt,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:84%
it only takes that one person
to say something like that,

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and we go back.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's true.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.390 align:middle line:10%
>> That's true.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And remember, too, that we're
talking about two distinct ways

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:90%
of knowing, here.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the knowing
that comes from the mind-brain,

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
the brain, which is part of
the encapsulated ego self,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the intuitive
knowing, which really,

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.790 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
it's part of the
brain, but it's also

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:90%
part of a larger intelligence.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's tapping into
that other intelligence.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Or perhaps it
can go from either.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not either/or.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:10%
It's not that we throw
away the rational

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:10%
or throw away the brain, it's
that we use both of them.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:10%
And in this case,
where we're really

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:10%
looking to follow our longing,
it's hearing that deeper voice.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:84%
And we don't hear that
through the brain,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.790 align:middle line:84%
we hear that through
our intuitive channels.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I kind of think of it as
hearing it through the heart.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And you need to be a little
more quiet in your life.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
You need to be a
little more reflective.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.720 align:middle line:84%
You maybe need to listen to
your dreams a little more.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:84%
You maybe need to take
some time out and just

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
sit in your garden,
or sit on a park bench

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, and just let
that voice come to you.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
It's like you offer it a
place, like a hostess would

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:90%
set a dinner table.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.120 align:middle line:84%
You set a dinner
table for that voice.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Be host to your own inner voice.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Invite it in.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> With respect to that you said
what's important is to listen

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.970 align:middle line:84%
to the call, no
matter how distant.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that sometimes
that's the step that we miss.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
We haven't heard it unless
we've taken the time

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:90%
to really evaluate--

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.010 align:middle line:84%
it's that important
that we listen.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:10%
Well, sometimes, if we don't
listen, and we don't listen,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.970 align:middle line:10%
and we don't listen, then the
voice can get so loud that it--

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:10%
>> We may get fired.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, besides getting--
with something drastic,

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:52.490 align:middle line:84%
or we get sick, and we then
we really have to listen

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.790 align:middle line:84%
because we're can't even
move, we're not feeling well.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.340 align:middle line:84%
So we've heard plenty
of stories in that way.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
So we'd like to encourage people
to go ahead and listen now

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:84%
to the small, quiet
voice before it's

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
having to shout in our
ears because we're really

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
unhappy with where we are.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.780 align:middle line:84%
>> It's quite a creative task,
too, to really go in and--

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:84%
I think you were saying earlier,
Michael, to listen to the point

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.112 align:middle line:84%
that you do depend
on the inner--

00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and develop the inner strength,
even through the wilderness

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:84%
experience, and not just
look at what's external.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Carolyn, it's
like, we can find that happiness

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:90%
wherever we are, too.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
We're not suggesting that
somebody has to quit their job.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there can be meaning
in so much of what we do.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a matter of looking
at where we are in finding ways

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
to work even better
where we are,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.640 align:middle line:90%
to find relationships that work.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's that--
we'd really like our work

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.150 align:middle line:84%
except for that one
person that really

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.890 align:middle line:84%
bugs us, that just
comes in all a grump,

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and they never
acknowledge our work.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.435 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they're our
supervisor, and you just

00:10:09.435 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
think that you'll never
get along with that person.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, what we
suggest that one does

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.000 align:middle line:84%
is to think about that
person-- when that person was

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
a little tiny baby.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Think about that person,
when that person was

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.490 align:middle line:84%
so small that it was just there
in joy and love and innocence.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And the eyes never
change, not really.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe around the eyes, you
maybe get wrinkled and all sorts

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:90%
But the eyes, they never change.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
They look just like they
looked when we were babies.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.140 align:middle line:84%
So just remember every day
to look at that person,

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.770 align:middle line:84%
and look in their eyes, and
when you say good morning,

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.070 align:middle line:84%
you're saying good morning
to that sweet innocence that

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.860 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been overlaid by
all of their problems,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
and all of their
disappointments.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what you're
talking about in "True Work"

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.070 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about transforming
a toxic or a negative

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
situation, or negative
thoughts that you're taking

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.270 align:middle line:90%
to the workplace.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And that will have-- that will
make a difference, to start

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:90%
to feel it within yourself.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean to put it on.

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're saying,
something that's so deep

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is to find a truth and a beauty
in that person before you--

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.450 align:middle line:90%
truly.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And then it transforms the
energy of the whole situation.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.060 align:middle line:84%
No, it may not change them, but
it will certainly change us.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're seeing
this change, I think,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:90%
in your workshops.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
You're doing workshops
across the country,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and you're seeing people
step out and change.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:84%
When we come back, I want you
to talk about the True Work

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:84%
Circles that you're
establishing and can

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.465 align:middle line:84%
help people establish
in their own environment

00:11:45.465 --> 00:11:47.670 align:middle line:90%
and their own community.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
You're watching "A
World of Wisdom."

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking with
Michael and Justine Toms,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%
the authors of "True Work."

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:54.913 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm so glad you've joined us.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:84%
We are talking
about our true work,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and having passion
in the workplace

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.250 align:middle line:84%
and in our chosen
path, and also learning

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
how to transform a
situation that might not be

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:90%
as fulfilling as we would want.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Something you do with your
workshops around the country

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.670 align:middle line:84%
is help people put together
a True Work Circle.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.440 align:middle line:90%
Tell us a little bit about them.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you know, Carolyn, we
feel that it's really important

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:10%
to have people who support
us in our fullness,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.110 align:middle line:10%
and support our potential, and
support the passion that we

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.780 align:middle line:10%
want, the dream that
we want to manifest.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.670 align:middle line:10%
So we call it
surrounding ourselves

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.140 align:middle line:10%
with people of the heart,
people who will support us.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:10%
And when we do this,
it's to get together

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:10%
with five to eight people
on a regular basis.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So invite friends, and put it
in your schedule, and meet,

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
let's say, once a
week for an evening.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:10%
And this is a place--
a sacred time outside

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.640 align:middle line:10%
of the rest of our lives,
where we speak from our hearts

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:10%
and we listen from our hearts.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's very important that
we don't bring in judgments.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
We're not there
to fix each other,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:84%
but we're there to truly
listen and hear each other,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:90%
and to speak our truth.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you're truly
listened to in that way,

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:84%
you might find yourself saying
new things, maybe things

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that you've never said before,
because it's a safe environment

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.200 align:middle line:90%
in which to do that.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So we say it's good
to meet regularly.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:10%
>> And the purpose of this
is to support one another

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.356 align:middle line:10%
in your passion for whatever it
is that you're spending so much

00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:42.156 align:middle line:10%
time--

00:13:42.156 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:10%
>> That, and also to provide a
space to release and to voice

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.590 align:middle line:10%
some of the concerns that
one may have in a difficult

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:10%
or toxic work situation.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Often, it's not possible
to voice those concerns

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.245 align:middle line:84%
in the workplace itself
because of the circumstances,

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:00.370 align:middle line:90%
but you have to voice them.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.150 align:middle line:84%
You have to have a
place to voice them,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.360 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't,
if you repress them,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.450 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to
come out in other ways.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
They're going to come
around and bite you.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.605 align:middle line:84%
And it may affect your
health, physical, emotional,

00:14:13.605 --> 00:14:14.405 align:middle line:90%
scriptural.

00:14:14.405 --> 00:14:17.050 align:middle line:84%
It can have any number
of repercussions

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:20.750 align:middle line:84%
if you don't address them, and
look at them, and voice them.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
reason why it's

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
important to have
a circle of friends

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.300 align:middle line:84%
of the heart who can reflect
to you what's going on,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:90%
what's happening.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a story
to tell about that.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:90%
In one of my True Work Circles--

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:90%
it was a women's circle.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
women in the circle,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
she came, and she was
speaking about her work.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.595 align:middle line:84%
Now, she liked her work very
much, but it was getting to--

00:14:44.595 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:84%
we asked a question
in our workshops,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.160 align:middle line:84%
are you finding yourself in your
work or are you losing yourself

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.300 align:middle line:90%
in your work?

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, she was finding she was
losing herself in her work.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was
good work, it was--

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Consuming her.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> --just taking over her life.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that,
she was saying

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:84%
that she was going to have
to turn in her resignation.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
So we all listened
deeply to her,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and we all encouraged
her, in a way,

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to do what felt right in her
heart to do, whatever that was.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next time
we came to the circle,

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:20.980 align:middle line:90%
she said, well, guess what?

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
She had turned in
her resignation.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
She wasn't going
to just leave them,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.380 align:middle line:84%
she said that she would
spend six months training

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.990 align:middle line:90%
another person.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:32.350 align:middle line:84%
But there was other passions
that she wanted to pursue.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, they loved her so
much, and loved the work

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:84%
that she did so much, they said,
oh, please, please stay on.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
What we'll do is that, well,
you can work less time,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.575 align:middle line:84%
and we'll give you more money,
and give you an assistant.

00:15:44.575 --> 00:15:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHING] You know,
there's a quote that I keep

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:90%
on my computer.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.950 align:middle line:84%
"Love flows the moment
you tell your truth."

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it sounds like,
that when you finally say,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:84%
this is my limit, and you have
your protest, or your boundary,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
or you go to the inner resource,
you find that things start--

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.225 align:middle line:84%
the universe
cooperates so quickly.

00:16:06.225 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And isn't is amazing how
long we can resist telling

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.420 align:middle line:90%
our truth?

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can sit on
it for a long time.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So in a True Work Circle,
you get to practice telling

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
your truth in a very
safe environment,

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.190 align:middle line:84%
where you're not going to be
jumped on right away, or--

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
it really is a wonderful way to
practice our telling our truth.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things-- when we
first started New Dimensions,

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.520 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that I did
was identify the whole group

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:84%
of people, various people
in different fields,

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.790 align:middle line:84%
who were the kind of-- who were
the people that we wanted to be

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:43.720 align:middle line:84%
engaged with in New Dimensions,
New Dimensions being a vehicle

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
in the original vision, a
vehicle that would present

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the new ideas
that were emerging,

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and present them in a way
that people could hear them.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.740 align:middle line:84%
So that it wasn't being
presented in the context of,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
this is the way, the
truth, and the light,

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.330 align:middle line:90%
and this is what you should do.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But rather, here's another
way of seeing the world.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Here's another way.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.932 align:middle line:90%
Here's another way.

00:17:03.932 --> 00:17:05.349 align:middle line:84%
So New Dimensions,
what it's about

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.430 align:middle line:84%
is expanding the landscape,
enlarging the lens

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.450 align:middle line:90%
through which we see the world.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.089 align:middle line:90%
So I went around and met--

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and made appointments
with these various people,

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and went and talked to
them, and shared with them

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:84%
what the vision of New
Dimensions was with the idea

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.460 align:middle line:84%
that, if it was not a good
idea, they would tell me.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
They would say, oh,
it's not going to--

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you can do
that, for whatever reason.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Or if it was a good idea,
they would support me.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that
every one of those people

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I talked to, in my
experience, they

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
all gave me very
positive feedback, very

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.050 align:middle line:90%
positive support.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So that led me to the next step
that, OK, this is a good idea.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
This is an idea
that's got some merit.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:84%
So I'll proceed
ahead and go forward.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So it was important for me to
gather that support initially,

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
because it gave
me the strength--

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:84%
just, it would
confirm my own vision,

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.110 align:middle line:84%
confirm the vision that we had
and it also gave us energy.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.370 align:middle line:90%
>> We're powerful beings, too.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.740 align:middle line:84%
We can find those that
are going to support us,

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and we can find those
that will kvetch with us.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So six of those people
volunteered their services

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.910 align:middle line:90%
to do a lecture series for us.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have to
pay them a fee.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.877 align:middle line:84%
They came and gave us
their time and energy free.

00:18:25.877 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And that came out
of the relationship.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:84%
It came out of the00 and then
out of that lecture series,

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
we got the invitation
to do a radio program.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.632 align:middle line:84%
Because we didn't initially
think we were going to-- we

00:18:35.632 --> 00:18:38.410 align:middle line:84%
didn't have radio in mind,
but that produced the radio.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> How important is intent?

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, you talked
about that extensively.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So explain a little
bit about what intent--

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:90%
where's it coming from?

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Intention is directly
connected to spirit.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Spirit and intention
are connected.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And so spirit drives intention,
and consciousness is the agent

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.070 align:middle line:90%
for manifesting intention.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So intention is the
vision, it's the dream.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.440 align:middle line:84%
It's the overarching
vision that we hold

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:90%
for what it is we want to do.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And that vision may
be-- in our case,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
it was, a few years ago,
a 24-hour life-enhancing

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.130 align:middle line:90%
programming service.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, now, in conjunction
with Wisdom Radio and Wisdom

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Channel, we're
doing that together.

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:28.955 align:middle line:90%
We've got programming.

00:19:28.955 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
The Wisdom Network has the
facilities and resources.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:90%
So that vision is manifesting.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's an overall,
overarching vision.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, within that,
to manifest a vision

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.930 align:middle line:84%
requires lots of little
decisions, lots of details--

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:84%
attention to detail, lots of
things that have to be done.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Often, what happens, that
people carry a vision

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and they want it to
happen right now.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:90%
Because you can see it, you see?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
You can see it in your
mind's eye, and it's like,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.530 align:middle line:90%
let's make it happen.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.195 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a society that
we want it, and we want it now.

00:20:03.195 --> 00:20:05.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, with vision, it
doesn't work that way.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
What it requires is energy and
commitment and persistence.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's out of our
giving our energy

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.660 align:middle line:90%
that the vision can manifest.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.943 align:middle line:84%
There's lots of details
to be dealt with.

00:20:15.943 --> 00:20:17.360 align:middle line:84%
Not all of those
details are going

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:84%
to be pleasant and enjoyable,
but they have to be done.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
It's like the phrase,
God lives in the details.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And what is meant by that
phrase is giving our fullness

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.320 align:middle line:84%
to everything, no matter
how small or insignificant

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.600 align:middle line:90%
it may appear to be.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:84%
It's important to give
our fullness to it.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.730 align:middle line:10%
>> You talked about, also,
an experience when you were

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:10%
a child, with the story about
"mother, may I," I think,

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:10%
or "advance a
step," or something.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And you really
emphasized the importance

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to take those baby steps, and
be diligent and consistent

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.620 align:middle line:90%
in those baby steps.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a baby step
is hearing that voice

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
that we just pause in that
moment to hear, don't we?

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's so true, that--

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:10%
I think that what
is important for us

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:05.200 align:middle line:10%
is, when we have an overall
vision, it might seem very far

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.070 align:middle line:10%
away and, oh, it's so big,
how will we ever get there?

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.130 align:middle line:10%
Well, we get there by
taking one step at a time.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And these steps in that game
that we played as a child,

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
mother may I, they
were called baby steps.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.100 align:middle line:84%
And they are one step
connected to another.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.180 align:middle line:90%
One little step.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.780 align:middle line:84%
But you put those together,
and you are surely going

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.910 align:middle line:90%
towards that dream manifesting.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's a matter of just keeping
at it, keeping up the momentum.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It seems, too--

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.890 align:middle line:84%
it just occurred to
me that everything

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that you have shared
in the book is almost

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.830 align:middle line:90%
like a baby step in itself.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:43.270 align:middle line:84%
You gather the support,
you get in community

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.880 align:middle line:84%
with your true work, you
have a daily practice

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.710 align:middle line:90%
of continuing to vision.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:84%
You're mindful of who you
share your dream and vision

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.210 align:middle line:84%
with so you do
have that support.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.960 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds
of ways, aren't there?

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.820 align:middle line:10%
And we want to
mention as to how to--

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:10%
one of the ways to connect
with support for our True Work

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.770 align:middle line:10%
Circles is to connect
through our website.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.740 align:middle line:10%
