[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.976 --> 00:01:06.110 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> You are in for
a blessing today.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.900 align:middle line:84%
As you grow in self-awareness
and become more informed

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
by life's challenges, you
will treasure spending time

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.180 align:middle line:90%
with my guest.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:90%
She is a light.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
She's dedicated to the positive
aspects of healing and helping

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.910 align:middle line:84%
millions in being the best
in body, mind, and spirit.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft, and welcome
to "A World of Wisdom."

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Linda MacKenzie is an active
holistic health practitioner

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and teacher of
alternative awareness.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
She is hosting her
own radio show,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.840 align:middle line:90%
"Creative Health and Spirit."

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:90%
And we're thankful to have her.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Linda.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What I didn't add was you're
into over 10 million homes,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I think, with the radio show.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But before this even got
started, you were an engineer.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And probably one of the most
fascinating things about you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you bring
that engineering background.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you became
God-based psychic.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.980 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, boy, it was an
amazing journey, actually.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:84%
What happened was I saw God
when I was eight years old.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a lot
of different kinds

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.160 align:middle line:84%
of psychic experiences
up to that point.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
What happened then was about 23,
God said, well, stop this now.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, OK.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that I
would be an engineer.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I was one
of the first women

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
data communications engineers
in the airline industry.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And I designed satellite
systems and air-to-ground radio

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.030 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And I did that for
about 18 years.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.550 align:middle line:84%
And then about three years ago,
God said, time to shift again.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:90%
And he said, let's go.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And one thing led to
another, and I resurfaced

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:90%
with my psychic abilities.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.897 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been
blossoming since then.

00:03:03.897 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think
we're finding that some

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.550 align:middle line:90%
of the greatest healers now on--

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.790 align:middle line:84%
healers from-- in
all aspects are

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:84%
receiving a lot of their wisdom
through divine appointment.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're going
to a college or a university

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:90%
to gain this knowledge.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:90%
I find it interesting, though.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
engineering is left-brain,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:90%
as I'm always joking about.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the intuitive, the
psychic, is back over here

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.052 align:middle line:90%
on this other side.

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, I think--
and this is the word according

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to Linda, which may mean
absolutely nothing, OK?

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.990 align:middle line:84%
But I think that the
psychic ability is somewhere

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:90%
between the two.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
See, I believe that we
use 10% part of our brains

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.780 align:middle line:84%
and when we learn to balance the
left side with the right side,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
that we create an
access or a pathway

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.940 align:middle line:90%
to the 90% part of the brain.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's where psychic ability
comes from and self-healing.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
interesting story.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
In 1987, I had the
chronic fatigue syndrome

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:90%
or Epstein-Barr virus.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And after five months of
hectic search by the doctors,

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:84%
from brain tumors to whatever,
they told me what I had.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And they told me to go home.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:90%
And there was no help with that.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And so through hypnosis
and nutrition and vitamins

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and herbs, I've healed myself.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.138 align:middle line:84%
And I've been
sickness-free since 1992.

00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You think that launched
what you're doing now?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it did,
because it also--

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.440 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
God wanted me to do

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
was to tell people that
there is hope in life,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
that we must face our fears, and
for me to give out information.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.690 align:middle line:84%
So everything I do in
this life from now on

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.790 align:middle line:84%
is to give out information,
in truth and integrity.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You have such a personal
relationship with God.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.530 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to
those people that

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.290 align:middle line:90%
are seeking the same thing?

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Look to your heart.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Trust in your heart, and
know that he's there.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.280 align:middle line:84%
There's really-- it's
very simple, actually.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:90%
Surrender.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%
In every aspect of your
life, body, mind, spirit,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.780 align:middle line:84%
emotional, mental,
whatever you want to do,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
if you surrender and
know that God is there,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:84%
he'll be there
100% at all times.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And surrendering takes
different shapes, doesn't it?

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And different times--

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in--

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm still in the path of
surrendering, you know?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the growth and
the change process, you know?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:90%
So-- and it-- and it gets tough.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.712 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes, you surrender.

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:50.785 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it
hits you again,

00:05:50.785 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
and you gotta learn
to surrender again.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But don't we learn by every
time that we do surrender?

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And I-- I know it's
true surrender.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.780 align:middle line:84%
It's truly being
in a place of not

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
knowing what the
next step is and not

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.270 align:middle line:84%
relying on just the intellect or
experience to show you the way,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:84%
but really trusting that
there can be a paradigm shift.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be
changed and rearranged

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle line:90%
and do things differently.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:90%
That's a true surrender.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
another key points

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.410 align:middle line:84%
when we want to be on our
path and whichever that is.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
something great, because what--

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:84%
if we're contributing
to society and helping

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
people, however small, we're
doing what we're meant to do.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
So-- but some of the tricks of
it is to live in the moment.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're-- if
we live in the past,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
it stops us from
healing, even healing,

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.980 align:middle line:84%
because illness is
associated with remembering.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, illness is
associated with forgetting,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.520 align:middle line:84%
and health is associated with
remembering in the brain.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.980 align:middle line:84%
I am going for my PhD in
clinical hypnotherapy.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.410 align:middle line:84%
So if I talk a lot about
the left and right brain,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.790 align:middle line:90%
this is where that comes from.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to live in
the moment, forget the past,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
because it's over, and the
future has so many variables.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.090 align:middle line:84%
So if we live in the moment,
we can enjoy each moment

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.060 align:middle line:84%
as it unfolds, like
a petal of a flower.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can use all our
senses and tastes and--

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy it for what
it is or learn from it.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.280 align:middle line:90%
>> What is forgetting the past?

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.120 align:middle line:90%
Or what does it feel like?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.405 align:middle line:84%
How can I experience
forgetting the past?

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a good question,
because I think it's different

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:90%
for everyone.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And everyone is different.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.150 align:middle line:90%
The way we heal is different.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.320 align:middle line:90%
Our spirits are different.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Our minds are different.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need
to acknowledge that.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling of letting
go of the past is, to me--

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.790 align:middle line:90%
I can speak in my context--

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:84%
is to-- it's like having
a breath of fresh air

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.060 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that everything
around you is in focus.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
You can taste and touch
and smell and just live it,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a fulfilling feeling, like
a filling part in your heart

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.910 align:middle line:90%
and your body and your mind.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and if I have forgotten
something or really released

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it-- and when I think
of "forgetting,"

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
I think of not entertaining
those thoughts about the past

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.160 align:middle line:84%
that create any sort of
blocks for us going to-- being

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.650 align:middle line:90%
in the moment or going forward.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.419 align:middle line:84%
But then I'm in a position or a
relationship or reenter family

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.799 align:middle line:90%
situations or whatever.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I
have let that go,

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:90%
and I find out that I'm still--

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
I haven't.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if you look at it,
there's another little piece

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
acknowledge first.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.440 align:middle line:84%
So before we let
anything go, we need

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge that it's
there, that it exists.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Then we can let it go.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And then-- and my big words
on all my tapes and all my

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
is to feel, trust, and know.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And in your
engineering background,

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.328 align:middle line:84%
I know you were quite
I'll say popular.

00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot of
people that still know you

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:90%
from that reputation.

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Was it a subtle shift?

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Or was it a major awakening?

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a major.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled me kicking
and screaming into this--

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> They--

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, well, you
know, my girlfriends--

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>> God--

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> God, as well.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:84%
But my girlfriend
is an astrologer,

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:28.700 align:middle line:90%
and she did my chart.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you need
to be doing readings.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.650 align:middle line:90%
You need to be out there.

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, well, you
know, I'm not sure about this.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I helped
all the way through.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't quite sure.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so she's well, I'm
sending you people.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And people started
calling me from England.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.160 align:middle line:90%
And then I started--

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:90%
I manufactured 110 products in--

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.480 align:middle line:84%
in alternative
medicine and awareness

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.720 align:middle line:84%
to give out information
in a positive light

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.080 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate fear
of something new,

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
because the only constant
in life is change.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.840 align:middle line:84%
So-- and I seem to be
changing every-- every day,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:90%
you know, into something.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always doing the
thing that I'm supposed to do,

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:90%
and I trust that.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:84%
So I started out with
manufacturing some products.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.530 align:middle line:90%
And then I went and--

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and manufactured some tapes.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.960 align:middle line:84%
And-- and they were
all on healing.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And I started going on radio
and did this as guest spots.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And I went for my clinical
hypnotherapy degree,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:90%
and they heard on the tapes.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I had
combined the top three

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.480 align:middle line:84%
methods in hypnotherapy
innately on the tapes.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:90%
And they put--

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Naturally--

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Naturally, just, you know.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
And-- and then they
went ahead and put me

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.330 align:middle line:90%
in their PhD program.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I went into radio,
and I started my own show.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And we've been on the
air now for about--

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:84%
oh, about a year and
a couple of months.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Been very successful.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I have helped over 1,066
people in a year in one hour

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:90%
on a Sunday.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.910 align:middle line:84%
>> My goal is to help
one person a day,

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.950 align:middle line:84%
so I'm very ecstatic
about all this, you know?

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel that or think
that other people can learn

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:84%
to be psychics or can
learn to be more psychic?

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And they also need to
trust their own selves

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.850 align:middle line:84%
and their own heart,
OK, because there

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:25.980 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of
different ways to get

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.710 align:middle line:84%
to God, which is really what
being psychic is about, OK?

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And it is--

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Take some of the scary stuff
away from it when you say like

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.677 align:middle line:90%
that, when you really--

00:11:35.677 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And I am a God-based psychic.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean-- and I'm right
there, and he's with me.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And I talk to him,
and he guides me.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:90%
And I trust him.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And-- and I have a lot
of peace from that.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.270 align:middle line:90%
So you know.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.230 align:middle line:90%
In this way, I--

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.440 align:middle line:84%
I get to help other
people all of the time.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's wonderful.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So when someone
trusts in their heart,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
that helps in order to develop
their own psychic awareness

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.955 align:middle line:84%
or their channels to
receive information?

00:12:03.955 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And I lose the word--

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
use the word "channel" lightly,
but receive information

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:90%
from God?

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:09.313 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:90%
And there's a knowing.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, everyone has this knowing.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
the concept of truth.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Whether we choose
to use it or not

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is, again, up to that individual
because God is very good, OK?

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:27.540 align:middle line:84%
He gives us the methods and
ways to control our own lives.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:90%
We control our own lives.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.380 align:middle line:84%
However, if we do
make a mistake--

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:84%
where there is no mistakes,
by the way, because it's only

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
a path to take a look at what
we've done so we can progress

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:90%
to our next step.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But say we decide that
we've taken a wrong path.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get to
relive it over and over

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and over again, as if you're
picking the wrong man all

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.780 align:middle line:84%
You'll get him again and
again, because he'll give you

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:90%
lots of opportunities to learn.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good to hear, too, when
you were saying earlier about

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:84%
the surrender, that
there are plateaus.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And we might go back
into a situation

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
and still have a
feeling or an experience

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.400 align:middle line:84%
that we haven't
forgotten or let it go,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.782 align:middle line:84%
but just to know that we
haven't lost ground in any way.

00:13:11.782 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be right back.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I do want to let
our viewers know

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
that you have a book
called "Inner Insights--

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.150 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Charts" by Linda
MacKenzie, alternative medicine

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and awareness
quick-reference charts.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be talking more
about this when we come back.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:90%


00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Welcome back to "A
World of Wisdom."

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.060 align:middle line:10%
And I'm speaking
with Linda MacKenzie.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.800 align:middle line:10%
She's the author of "Inner
Insights-- the Book of Charts."

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And a wonderful question
is to know why you wrote

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:90%
the book in the first place.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty thorough.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, no one had a reference
book on alternative medicine

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:90%
and awareness.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And so what we want to do is
educate people and eliminate

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:90%
fear, OK?

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We want to-- the only constant
thing in life is change.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And so to effect
positive ways to change,

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to give people
alternate methods

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.570 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at,
rather than just some

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
of the standards that don't
seem to be working quite as

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:90%
well anymore.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes a lot of the
scare out, too, the book does,

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.920 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of the
different charts.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.650 align:middle line:10%
>> But it's very easy,
because what I've designed is

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:23.630 align:middle line:10%
a reference book that has 78
quick-reference charts on 40

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.060 align:middle line:10%
different topics, from
acupressure to Western

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.060 align:middle line:10%
elements.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.935 align:middle line:10%
So if they-- someone
wanted to know something

00:14:28.935 --> 00:14:32.300 align:middle line:10%
about aromatherapy or
Bach flowers or numerology

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:10%
or astrology or what Native
American animals mean

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.810 align:middle line:10%
in your dreams or kabbalah,
it's all in one book.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And so what it does is it
allows people to figure out

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.840 align:middle line:84%
what they would like
to be interested in,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.390 align:middle line:84%
go out and buy more books on the
subject, and when they're done,

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
they can go ahead and
use the-- my book again

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:84%
as a quick-reference
chart again.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think this also speaks
to your earlier statement,

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
that they're all
different paths,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:84%
many different
ways to get to God.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, Linda, you've
talked about God is a "him."

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:90%
what-- why is that so for you?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:15:08.728 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've all said,
"Mother/Father God."

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.270 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.470 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you know,
that I believe

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is that there are many
paths to get to God.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.637 align:middle line:84%
And in my vision growing
up as a Catholic,

00:15:20.637 --> 00:15:22.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, and when I saw God
when I was eight years old,

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:84%
he manifested himself
in my vision, OK?

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So-- and it was a man, with
a white beard and whatever.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I am blessed
to be in the presence of God,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.170 align:middle line:90%
which isn't often--

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:90%
you know, he's pretty busy.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Yet he's there for each
one of us at all times--

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:90%
he's always in this man.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Or I see his robe or
his foot or wherever I'm

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:90%
supposed to be at at the time.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So-- but I believe that
God will manifest himself

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to you as you perceive
him, because perception

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:90%
is a very big thing in life.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:03.180 align:middle line:84%
When I do healing
or psychic readings,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'll say the "Our
Father," which is my standard.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:90%
And I get my ego out of the way.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.660 align:middle line:90%
And then I kind of feel.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm a clairsentient.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
kinds of psychics and--

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>> "Clairsensient,"
"sentient"-- what is that?

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>> That-- I probably
pronounced it wrong, because--

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I know I did, so--

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, coming--

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
being born in New York
and living in California

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
and traveling the
world, we never

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:24.635 align:middle line:84%
know how I'm going
to pronounce things.

00:16:24.635 --> 00:16:27.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:90%
What is a clairsentient?

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:90%
I feel what you're feeling.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK?

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's
comprised of energy.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's that
engineering mind, as well as

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:84%
the right-brain,
creative side of me.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.180 align:middle line:90%
We're all comprised of energy.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's either electromagnetic
or electrical energy, OK?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And everything has energy, trees
and flowers and everything.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, you know,
as we are using this energy,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I go into your energy path.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost
like the way I do it

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.475 align:middle line:90%
is like a cellular telephone.

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:02.850 align:middle line:84%
It's the best way
to describe it.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the
signal, but I'm there.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of go in, and I feel.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a sense, a knowing.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:84%
And then whoever's
connected to you is--

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:84%
there's a cord of energy to
that person that-- or people

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.779 align:middle line:84%
that are coming into your
life, there's energy.

00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:20.621 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doubting anybody.

00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:23.020 align:middle line:84%
Say, that's true, but
I have heard that.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what I do is
I've-- it's like microseconds

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:26.750 align:middle line:90%
or milliseconds.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.248 align:middle line:84%
And I'm over in
their path, and I

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:90%
can sense what they're feeling.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> There isn't a sense of
time, though, is it, for you?

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Time is-- time is human.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It is, though,
when you get this.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>> God doesn't have time.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:42.685 align:middle line:84%
And most psychics, when
you're talking to them,

00:17:42.685 --> 00:17:44.060 align:middle line:84%
if they're giving
you a time, you

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.477 align:middle line:84%
have to give them
a little leeway,

00:17:45.477 --> 00:17:49.220 align:middle line:84%
because we're in a space or a
realm where time is irrelevant.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there-- and I'm
going to use this word.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even like
to use it, but good

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.540 align:middle line:84%
and bad or good and
not-so-good psychics?

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not asking you to
make any judgment on someone

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
else, but in general.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, most of the readings
that I do are for other

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:90%
psychics.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:90%
That was very amazing to me.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:10%
And part of my
venue is to get them

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.860 align:middle line:10%
to their next step,
wherever it may be.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the difference.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:84%
There are people that--
who are intuitive

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.993 align:middle line:84%
that are calling
themselves "psychic," OK.

00:18:19.993 --> 00:18:21.410 align:middle line:84%
There's two-- it's
two different--

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.452 align:middle line:90%
>> And the difference is?

00:18:22.452 --> 00:18:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The difference is is
that when you get a psychic

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.450 align:middle line:90%
feeling-- first off, to--

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to reach the levels, you have
to be on a personal growth path

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:84%
to be able to accept the
power and the responsibilities

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a very hard job, because
you cannot interfere with that

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.023 align:middle line:90%
person's life path.

00:18:43.023 --> 00:18:45.440 align:middle line:84%
You need to give them-- and
so I'm a little different kind

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.240 align:middle line:90%
of psychic.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:90%
I tell them, don't call me back.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you the tools
to empower yourself,

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.737 align:middle line:90%
OK, because what better way?

00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
empower themselves,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:90%
they help other people.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little different
than most psychics.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
physical manifestation

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.290 align:middle line:84%
when you're having a
psychic experience, in lieu

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.640 align:middle line:90%
of an intuitive experience.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.313 align:middle line:84%
For me, the small of
my back gets numb, OK?

00:19:11.313 --> 00:19:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Other people, their
stomach may flutter.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.647 align:middle line:84%
Or their eyelids may
flutter, or they'll

00:19:14.647 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:90%
get a sensation in their hands.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know at that point,
you are connected with this

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:90%
other individual or--

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> With God.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And God is doing-- or with
whatever he's chosen to provide

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:84%
for me at that time, you know,
because sometimes, it's not.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's the path.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, he'll let
me do it on my own.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
>> So how is this different,
then, from intuition?

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Intuition can only go so far.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's intuitive.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:41.660 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has hunches.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's psychic.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in the world
has psychic abilities.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And your stockbroker will
tell you that all the time.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>> So would you see yourself--

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not touting you or
patronizing you in a way.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.040 align:middle line:84%
But would you see
yourself among the many

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and yet, compared to the
whole population, the few that

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:06.380 align:middle line:84%
might be showing us some
examples of how we can find

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:90%
that ability within ourselves?

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What seems to be happening
with my life is that whoever

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:90%
needs me comes.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:18.890 align:middle line:90%
So I don't question.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't put myself
on any kind of level.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.440 align:middle line:90%
I just am who I am, you know?

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:90%
And-- and everyone has value.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The power of the
thought, I think,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful thing
that we can begin to understand

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.870 align:middle line:90%
in our waking state.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And as our-- our human
being evolving state,

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:42.130 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the most
powerful things we can.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Every day I work
with this, what is--

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in
my thoughts right now?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.800 align:middle line:90%
What am I manifesting?

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.300 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the things that you

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:57.470 align:middle line:84%
can say to us about getting
a grip on those things that

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
are going through our
heads at all times?

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have a
little exercise I give,

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.420 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, there's a
lot of stress in the world,

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.220 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
As-- and there's
all sorts of stress.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
emotional-- electrical stress

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:84%
from the wires and
environmental stress.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's nutritional stress
when we don't get our vitamins.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And-- and this stress
makes our power of thought

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.250 align:middle line:84%
erratic, because we're
getting hit on all sides.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very hard today
in all walks of life, you know?

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.500 align:middle line:90%
It's just very, very tough.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is
say, take a minute

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.680 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of the stress.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.155 align:middle line:84%
And how you do that is you say
to yourself, I've got a minute.

00:21:38.155 --> 00:21:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give myself
a break in one minute.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to allow
all the emotions

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:45.000 align:middle line:90%
to come out and process.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that minute,
I am going to be centered,

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.840 align:middle line:84%
I am going to be whole, and
I'm going to be at peace.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And you close your eyes,
and you take a look

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
at the clock, before you
close your eyes, at the time.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.650 align:middle line:90%
And you close your eyes.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And you'll-- I see
fantastic colors.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.410 align:middle line:84%
When I get emotional--
and you know,

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.080 align:middle line:84%
because I'm processing
emotion all the time,

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll see all this
red light and--

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:07.950 align:middle line:84%
you know, and different
colors, you know?

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.005 align:middle line:90%
And so it's an amazing thing.

00:22:10.005 --> 00:22:12.360 align:middle line:84%
So-- and then that will
get me back to center

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:90%
and back to peace.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.540 align:middle line:84%
There's another--
there's another way

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.890 align:middle line:84%
to do that is to think of
your stomach chakra, OK?

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.843 align:middle line:84%
You think of your stomach
so that it centers you.

00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:23.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:23.643 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.258 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's all
sorts of little tricks.

00:22:26.258 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and that's part of
my thing is to give out.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:90%
And my radio show does this.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:33.288 align:middle line:84%
We do nothing but short
stuff on information,

00:22:33.288 --> 00:22:35.330 align:middle line:84%
alternative medicine,
awareness-- let's learn it.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We're glad to have you
on "Wisdom Radio," too.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
to close this time.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.195 align:middle line:84%
And we will have another
segment with you.

00:22:44.195 --> 00:22:46.320 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, I want
to let our viewers know

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.830 align:middle line:84%
about the "Inner Insights--
the Book of Charts"

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:84%
by Linda MacKenzie, alternative
medicine and awareness

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.668 align:middle line:90%
quick-reference charts.

00:22:53.668 --> 00:22:56.043 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to be
seeing a little bit of this

00:22:56.043 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:90%
during the break.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.165 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a pleasure
meeting with you.

00:23:00.165 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:84%
And till next time, you've been
watching "A World of Wisdom."

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft
with Linda MacKenzie.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:15.798 align:middle line:90%
