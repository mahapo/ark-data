00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.850 align:middle line:10%
>> What is really going on when
some meaningful coincidence

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:10%
occurs in your own life?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.950 align:middle line:10%
How do you recognize the
message of synchronicity?

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
My guest today will
show you how to watch

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:84%
for the little hints in
life that are guiding you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:90%
to your next step.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.650 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of
"Synchronicity as Spiritual

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Guidance" and 16 other
books on spirituality,

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and an honored guest
at the Wisdom Network.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Mark Thurston.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.723 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being with us.

00:00:54.723 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carolyn.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are a lot of
synchronistic events happening

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and you say there
are ways that we can recognize

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:90%
those.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.450 align:middle line:84%
There are hints that
are being given.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.780 align:middle line:84%
What are some of those hints
that we can pay attention to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.803 align:middle line:90%
in our own life?

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, some of their hints are
things that happen in our inner

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:10%
life, our dreams,
our intuitions,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:10%
our meditation experiences.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:10%
But just as surely,
there are things

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:10%
that happen in our outer life,
little coincidences, things

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:10%
that happen that by themselves,
would just be random,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:10%
but because they touch
us in a certain way,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.100 align:middle line:10%
it's suggested that it may be
guidance that's flowing to us.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.050 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the word
synchronistic came from--

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.022 align:middle line:90%
was it Freud?

00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:35.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Carl Jung
coined the term.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And he recognized,
as we all do,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that cause and effect is a
spiritual law and a physical

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.850 align:middle line:90%
law that shapes our experience.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
But he suggested there was
also a complementary law,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.940 align:middle line:84%
the other side of the coin,
and that life is connected,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.340 align:middle line:84%
that there are meaningful
coincidences where things don't

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:84%
really cause each other,
and yet, we experience them

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:90%
as being linked in some way.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like this is
something that as we move from

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe a life of
numbness or on the path,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
trying to keep up with
day to day activities,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.090 align:middle line:84%
if we back up and really
see that there's some order

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:90%
in things in our life.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And I like to think that
noticing synchronicity is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.920 align:middle line:84%
a matter of developing another
kind of attention that we

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.690 align:middle line:90%
typically have in life.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Our lives get so busy.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
We rush from one
thing to the next.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And we often don't stop and
pause to listen inwardly

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
or to really watch outwardly
for these synchronistic events.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Give us an idea.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Like, in your own life,
say, today or a typical day,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
where you might be paying
attention when maybe 20 years

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%
ago you weren't.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me tell you
one story of a synchronistic

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.835 align:middle line:90%
experience that I had.

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:45.770 align:middle line:84%
I had hoped to make
a trip to Europe

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to put on some workshops,
but I knew in order

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to pull that off I
would need a sponsor.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.475 align:middle line:84%
I especially wanted
to go to Germany,

00:02:52.475 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't really know who
could do that for me-- help me

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was driving home from work
thinking about this problem,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
and as I was sitting
at a red light,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I happened to notice the license
plate of the person right

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.440 align:middle line:90%
in front of me.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
It was a so-called
vanity license

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.370 align:middle line:84%
plate, where the person pays a
little extra money every year

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and they can have their
license say whatever they want.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.305 align:middle line:84%
And that license plate
in front of me said Rose,

00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
R-O-S-E space M. And I suddenly
remembered that I knew someone,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.270 align:middle line:84%
a friend in Germany, whose
name was Rose Morath,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and it occurred to me she might
be the very person who could

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.372 align:middle line:84%
help me put this series
of workshops together.

00:03:30.372 --> 00:03:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, about a year
later, they happened,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.105 align:middle line:90%
and she was the sponsor.

00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think Jung
would call that

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:90%
a synchronistic occurrence.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.980 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't caused-- it
wasn't as if the person who

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
had that license plate thought
several months earlier,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.400 align:middle line:84%
there's somebody in Germany
named Rose Morath, and surely

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
several months from
now, a guy named

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Mark Thurston's
going to be sitting

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:84%
behind me at a red
light, and he's

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:84%
going to need to
think of her name.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.850 align:middle line:84%
That's crazy to imagine
that cause and effect would

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.260 align:middle line:90%
have caused this.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But how are we more receptive
to these things happening?

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:90%
You paid attention to that.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's a
matter of developing a certain

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.700 align:middle line:84%
alertness-- inner
and outer alertness.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.200 align:middle line:84%
I know in my own
life that trying

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
to keep a regular meditation
time, at least daily,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.700 align:middle line:84%
is important for developing
that kind of sensitivity.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I think watching my
dreams, and sometimes I

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.200 align:middle line:84%
think synchronistic things
can come to us via dreams,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
but just being attentive to
one's soul life through dreams

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
can also attune us and
awaken us to that kind

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.220 align:middle line:90%
of daytime alertness as well.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.047 align:middle line:84%
Just watching for it,
keeping a journal-- keeping

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual journal of some
sort, what you're recording,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.297 align:middle line:84%
what's happening in your
inner and outer life,

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:44.110 align:middle line:84%
all these are tools that
can make it more frequent.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.083 align:middle line:84%
>> And the journaling, too,
you're actually asking for--

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:49.750 align:middle line:84%
journaling what's
going on in your life.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps you've got a
question that you are pondering

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and you're asking for insight.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
That's a time to be
more aware, isn't it?

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And I advocate working in
a very intentional way with

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:90%
getting guidance.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Like how?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me describe an
eight step sequence that I

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
encourage people to follow,
and it's part of my book,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:84%
"Synchronicity as
Spiritual Guidance."

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
The steps are pretty
straightforward.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:84%
The first is to have a
core value for your life,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.730 align:middle line:84%
or what Edgar Cayce, as
a spiritual philosopher

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual
psychologist, called

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:90%
setting a spiritual ideal.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.120 align:middle line:84%
But a core value,
what you're going

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
to put at the heart of your
life, that's the first step.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that something that
you automatically know?

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:29.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think
you can intuit it,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.850 align:middle line:84%
but I think it often
involves some self-study--

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.500 align:middle line:90%
some self-examination.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
For one person, it's
peace, for someone else,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
it's love, for someone
else, it's fairness,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.530 align:middle line:90%
for someone else, it's joy.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So before we go
to the second one,

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.590 align:middle line:84%
how would we find out
what our core value is?

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's a
matter of asking yourself,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.870 align:middle line:84%
what do I want to have
at the center of my life?

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.725 align:middle line:84%
What is the spirit or what
is the value or the quality

00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that, more than anything
else, I would like to have

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:90%
guiding and directing me?

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it have to be
somewhat of a spiritual ideal,

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:04.820 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual attribute,
if you will?

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It could be something
as simple as fairness.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I think for many people,
a core value of fairness

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.815 align:middle line:90%
is a good starting point.

00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And they're not ready to
say Christ, consciousness,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:90%
or Buddha.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.490 align:middle line:10%
>> But simply being
fair for them--

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.508 align:middle line:10%
>> Honest and harmless.

00:06:18.508 --> 00:06:19.800 align:middle line:90%
>> All those are possibilities.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.965 align:middle line:84%
>> And in this
guidance sequence,

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have that
as the starting point.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.965 align:middle line:84%
Because as potential guidance
comes into your mind,

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:28.340 align:middle line:84%
comes into your
attention, you've

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.980 align:middle line:84%
got to have some point of
reference to evaluate it.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Would it change?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Would you have a core
ideal today or value

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
today that in 10 years
would be something else?

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Definitely.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I think we grow and
develop and we mature

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:90%
spiritually, emotionally, sure.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I can see even having a
core ideal or value today,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.210 align:middle line:84%
and then tomorrow having
something else as well.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would hope one's
core value wouldn't change quite

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.380 align:middle line:90%
that often.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it finds
ways of being applied

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.960 align:middle line:90%
a little bit differently.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.860 align:middle line:84%
If my core value
was love, the way

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I express it in my relationship
with my son or daughter

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.815 align:middle line:84%
might be a little bit different
than the way I express it

00:07:02.815 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:90%
at work with a colleague.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So we can have ideals and
aspirations that are more

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:90%
situational.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
What I'm advocating is a core
for this spiritual ideal that's

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:84%
going to be the starting point
for working with guidance.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.905 align:middle line:84%
Then a second step is
to formulate a question.

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And you'd be surprised
how often people

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get that
specific about their question.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
They just want to say,
well, tell me what to do,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.190 align:middle line:84%
or what should I
do next in my life?

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.452 align:middle line:84%
But as we make that
question much more specific,

00:07:30.452 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and even write it
down in a journal

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
or on a piece of paper,
what is it you want to know?

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And actually to write
it out, pen or pencil

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.820 align:middle line:90%
on a piece of paper.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it that we don't
want to write it out sometimes

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.810 align:middle line:90%
and really ask the question?

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, sometimes we
have to confront our fears

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
or our doubts or our
lack of self-esteem,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
or there's probably a
myriad set of reasons.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> That we might get what
we want, I would think--

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Or that we don't deserve
what we're seeking for.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Lots of possibilities for why
we avoid that second step.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But let's suppose we
can get a core value,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
we can really write out
exactly what our question is.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Then before we start looking
for spiritual guidance,

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.220 align:middle line:84%
the next couple of
steps involve working

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.590 align:middle line:84%
with our conscious,
rational minds.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So step three is to collect
all the information or pieces

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
of data we have access to in
the waking, logical, analytical

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.038 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to even go
back to the third step.

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:25.330 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the one we're on now.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:25.580 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.830 align:middle line:10%
I guess the second step, then.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
What would be a kind of
question that we might ask?

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.603 align:middle line:84%
I think it might help
in following along.

00:08:33.603 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:10%
What would be something-- if
our core value was love, then

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.299 align:middle line:10%
what would be a question that
we might ask in the second step?

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.129 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe you have a
question about your career.

00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Should I continue
in my current job?

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.510 align:middle line:84%
Or is it time to
retire from that

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:90%
and start on a second career?

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a very specific question.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that one can be
posed in a yes, no answer.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
And many people find as they
work with spiritual guidance

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.360 align:middle line:84%
in the fifth and sixth
step in this sequence

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that if the question has
been worded in a yes, no way,

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
it's easier for them to discern
the guidance as it comes.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But I've often worked
with open ended questions,

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.720 align:middle line:90%
and it can work that way, too.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
So with step three,
we're just going

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.720 align:middle line:84%
to use our common sense
and our conscious minds.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:84%
We collect information, get all
the pieces we can consciously.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And then for step
four, we arrive

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.510 align:middle line:84%
at a tentative or
provisional decision.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
We're not going
to act on it yet,

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
but we've said, from the
best I know so far, here's

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:90%
what my decision would be.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What I'm hearing,
too, at this point,

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
you still have not focused on
any obstacles or any reasons

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
why I cannot have
what I want in life.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:84%
You're really
co-creating, if you will.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.770 align:middle line:84%
You're actually getting
in touch with what it is

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.640 align:middle line:90%
that you actually want in life.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, some of the obstacles
may come up as you think about

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.840 align:middle line:84%
what information you
have access to right now.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.180 align:middle line:84%
That third step,
you may recognize,

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.845 align:middle line:84%
well, I can't really quit my job
because my paycheck is so good

00:09:56.845 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and I have these
financial commitments.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.928 align:middle line:84%
It would be a real
stretch to think

00:09:59.928 --> 00:10:01.355 align:middle line:90%
about starting a second career.

00:10:01.355 --> 00:10:03.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Or it may require a
move in order to advance,

00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:04.770 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Or my family members
don't support this.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
These could be obstacles
that are pieces of the puzzle

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.783 align:middle line:84%
that you consciously
know about already.

00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.047 align:middle line:84%
>> But again, before you start
looking for the unconscious

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to give you guidance or
synchronistic signs all around

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.500 align:middle line:84%
you to point the way,
you do this homework.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, in step number five, with
a tentative decision already

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.140 align:middle line:84%
sitting over here waiting,
you begin to open yourself

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:90%
to your dreams.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
You ask in meditation
for promptings,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
you begin to watch for a
little synchronistic events,

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
like my license
plate, and so forth.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And you try to collect
as much as you can

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:42.070 align:middle line:84%
from these more non-traditional
ways of getting input.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And I always say to people,
use more than one source.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I even recommend working
with things like the "I

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Ching" or astrology,
or tools that

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.710 align:middle line:84%
can help us to
elicit or recognize

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.790 align:middle line:90%
some of this guidance.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we've got to
evaluate the guidance,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want to become
superstitious about it.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to pick and choose
what resonates and feels right

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.660 align:middle line:90%
to us.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>> When it feels right to
you, what is the experience?

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It feels to me as if my
best self is being called

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.640 align:middle line:90%
to the surface.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
It feels as if
something within me

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that knows what I
really ought to be doing

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.120 align:middle line:84%
is being reminded
of that knowledge.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't there a fraction,
too, the time that there is no

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:90%
self-doubt in that moment?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.980 align:middle line:10%
Maybe the doubts
may come up later,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:10%
but in that moment
of pure knowing--

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, invariably,
the doubts creep in.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And even at step
number seven, where

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
you now have formulated
a guided decision

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and you measure that against
your ideal, your core value

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.995 align:middle line:84%
to make sure it's
pointing you in a way

00:11:44.995 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
that you can live with in
keeping with your best self,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.630 align:middle line:84%
there's still obstacles
that creep in,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.310 align:middle line:90%
there's doubts that creep in.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And then step eight
is to act on it.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.185 align:middle line:84%
But even as you're
acting, you've

00:11:55.185 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:84%
got to deal with some of these
obstacles you're referring to.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:00.050 align:middle line:10%
>> I'd love for
you to go through--

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.775 align:middle line:10%
in our next segment, to
go through a good example

00:12:03.775 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:10%
or an example we
could relate to,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.790 align:middle line:10%
maybe it's the changing
jobs or whatever,

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:10%
and give us an idea of how
we can go through each step.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm understanding,
too, it doesn't necessarily

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.650 align:middle line:90%
happen in a day or two days.

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:90%
That you may go--

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I know I've done the
40-day journal before.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
You may go a period
of time where

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.863 align:middle line:84%
you're working on a
particular question

00:12:22.863 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and looking for the
synchronistic events

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.515 align:middle line:90%
I'll have an example.

00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.200 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with Dr.
Mark Thurston, the author

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
of "Synchronicity as Spiritual
Guidance, All of Life

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.040 align:middle line:84%
is Working Together to
Leave You Little Hints."

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.994 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:12:38.994 --> 00:12:42.473 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:42.473 --> 00:12:43.970 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for joining us.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft, speaking
with Dr. Mark Thurston.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
spiritual guidance.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.105 align:middle line:10%
Now, Mark has written the book,
"Synchronicity as Spiritual

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:10%
Guidance," and I think
one of the things that

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.690 align:middle line:10%
came to mind
earlier was, what do

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:10%
you say to people who
receive spiritual guidance

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:10%
or awareness of synchronistic
events from other people?

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Is this something that only
we can know the synchronicity

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.240 align:middle line:90%
in our own life?

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
We can't know it for
someone else, can we?

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think sometimes
we get messages that are

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:90%
for our own self--

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we do with that,
and how do we know it has some

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:90%
value?

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're on
a path yourself,

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.500 align:middle line:84%
when you're working on
your own spirituality,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:84%
I think that you are open and
receptive to others sometimes

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
having a piece of
the puzzle for you.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, we
know because it fits.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.770 align:middle line:84%
You ever put together
a jigsaw puzzle

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.750 align:middle line:84%
and you find one
that fits because

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.348 align:middle line:84%
of the context of the other
pieces arranged around it?

00:13:39.348 --> 00:13:41.390 align:middle line:84%
In a similar way, when
you're working on yourself

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and you're getting some
of your own pieces,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:84%
then when somebody else
has a piece to offer you

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and it fits, then it's with a
greater sense of reliability

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.810 align:middle line:84%
you can say, boy, thank you,
that was really of help to me

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:51.230 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be
important, I imagine,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
to understand our own
intent in sharing that,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as perhaps the intent
of someone else and sharing

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.880 align:middle line:84%
the information to
really know if it fits.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:10%
>> As skillful as I think Edgar
Cayce was for more than 40

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:10%
years in giving spiritual
advice to others,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:10%
it's not surprising
people sometimes ask him,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:10%
what should I do if I think I'm
getting guidance for someone

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:10%
else?

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And his answer was, if you
feel like you've gotten a dream

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.878 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
about somebody else,

00:14:17.878 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
or if you feel like you're
getting a meditation insight

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
for someone else,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
you should be willing to
share the information,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.512 align:middle line:90%
but never press the issue.

00:14:26.512 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So if I've had a dream
and I think, maybe

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:84%
it's really about Carolyn,
be willing to share it,

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:84%
but do it in a way that
leaves it open for you to say,

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm sure
that's not about me.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Or if I say I've had a
meditation experience where

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:40.913 align:middle line:84%
I heard a little voice that
said something for you,

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
I would share it in a
way that left you plenty

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.690 align:middle line:84%
of outs to say, well,
that's not for me,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.370 align:middle line:90%
that must be your own message.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:90%
To never press it.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I would think in my own
life, I think that if I do get

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
something, that I'm really
aware of how this might impact

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.870 align:middle line:84%
the other person as well, and
to share it from a harmless

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:90%
intent.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't feel
like that, to not share it.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
You said you had an example
that will help us understand

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the eight steps
that you delineate

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.710 align:middle line:90%
in your book on synchronicity.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Give us an idea--

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm going to
tell a story on myself.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.350 align:middle line:84%
>> This goes back more
than a couple of decades,

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.670 align:middle line:84%
when I was just getting
out of undergraduate school

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.580 align:middle line:84%
in the last couple of weeks
of my senior year of college,

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and I realized I faced
a very big decision.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.643 align:middle line:90%
What was I going to do next?

00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through
those eight steps,

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.102 align:middle line:84%
which really come out
of the Cayce material

00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:28.970 align:middle line:84%
that I'd been studying
already in college.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.405 align:middle line:84%
And my spiritual ideal at
that time was loving service.

00:15:32.405 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to do
something with my life that

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:90%
would bespeak loving service.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.030 align:middle line:90%
I wrote my question out.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.550 align:middle line:84%
What should I do
next upon graduation?

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.160 align:middle line:90%
That's step two.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Step three was to collect
all the information

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
that I could just at a
commonsense, rational level.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:90%
And I began to look for options.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
One was to go to
graduate school.

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Another was to take a year off
and travel around the country,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and try to find myself,
as people back in that era

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:90%
used to call it.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And a third was to go get a
job right away, heaven forbid.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.490 align:middle line:84%
But I saw at least
those three options,

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:06.872 align:middle line:84%
and I was looking
into each one of them.

00:16:06.872 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And the only place
that I can think

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:84%
of where I might be
interested in getting a job

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
was to move to Virginia
Beach, Virginia

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.215 align:middle line:84%
and try to work at the
Edgar Cayce Center.

00:16:15.215 --> 00:16:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But I was also considering
a graduate school,

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.270 align:middle line:84%
and also this traveling
around a year.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And I finally made
a conscious decision

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
that I would move
to Virginia Beach,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and see if I could
get a job there.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Then I began to look
for guidance about

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.780 align:middle line:84%
whether that would be an
appropriate decision or not.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you aware of all these
steps that you were doing

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:90%
during the time?

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
>> At that time, you
were aware of exact--

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew about this
eight step procedure,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and I was doing it very
intentionally and consciously.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And I began to ask at the
end of every meditation time

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:90%
for a prompting or an intuition.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I began to watch my
dreams very carefully.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I began to watch for little
signs of things that happened

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.240 align:middle line:90%
and things people said to me.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the most dramatic guidance
was a dream that I had,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:59.210 align:middle line:84%
and I dreamed just a couple
of weeks into this process

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
that I was sitting at a
table, just as you and I

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.069 align:middle line:84%
are sitting here, and
across the table from me

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
was Edgar Cayce's grandson,
Charles Thomas Cayce.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And I had met him
at some conferences

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.880 align:middle line:90%
when I was a college student.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
He was working there
in Virginia Beach,

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and he told me in
this dream that he

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:84%
was getting ready to hire
somebody to work with him.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream I said, I'm
available, hire me, hire me.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.430 align:middle line:84%
And we talked and we talked,
and the last thing I remembered

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
him saying when I
woke up from the dream

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
was he had somebody else in
mind, and I could forget it,

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.160 align:middle line:90%
there was no job for me there.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up from that dream,
and I was very discouraged,

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.600 align:middle line:84%
but I remarked to myself
how this process works,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.453 align:middle line:90%
and I wrote the dream down.

00:17:37.453 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that dream, I began

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.550 align:middle line:84%
to set in motion one
of the other options.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, eight nights later,
I had a second dream.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I was walking down a
sidewalk in the second dream,

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and here came this same
man, Charles Thomas Cayce.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.990 align:middle line:84%
He's still 100 feet away or so
when I hollered to him, hey,

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:84%
I had a dream about
you the other night.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And as he's approaching
me, he hollers back,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:90%
I remember that dream.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to approach
each other, and he says,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.783 align:middle line:84%
but you forgot the
second half of the dream.

00:18:07.783 --> 00:18:09.200 align:middle line:84%
Mind you, I'm still
in this dream.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that I'm dreaming.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what
part did I forget?

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And he said, when I told you
you couldn't have the job,

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.320 align:middle line:84%
you didn't like my answer,
and you went and got

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
a file of everything you had
been doing for the last five

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And I looked through that
and I liked it so much,

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.290 align:middle line:84%
I changed my mind and I told
you you could have the job.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, that's
great, what is the job?

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
And he said, in charge of
college age young people

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:90%
looking for God.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I said,
when does it start?

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Christmas
day this year.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, mind you, this
dream was in May of 1972,

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
it's predicting months and
months into the future.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I woke up from the second
dream, wrote that down.

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
I was very excited.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
I had other forms of guidance
as well that I evaluated.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, I made what
I felt was a guided decision,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.700 align:middle line:84%
took a risk, moved 1,000 miles
to Virginia Beach, got there.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you pointed out,
sometimes there's obstacles.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.260 align:middle line:90%
There was no job.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.140 align:middle line:84%
That was all I could do to
keep from going up to see him

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.730 align:middle line:84%
in the waking flesh
and blood state

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.355 align:middle line:84%
and telling him the
dreams, and saying,

00:19:12.355 --> 00:19:13.700 align:middle line:90%
where's the job you promised?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>> But I didn't do that.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And I hung around for a while
and found some little odds

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:90%
and ends jobs.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody
announced he was going off

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to graduate school, and
I applied for that job

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:90%
and I got it.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was youth
activities coordinator,

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:84%
and it began New
Year's Day 1973.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:35.270 align:middle line:84%
It was within seven days of
what that dream had predicted.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Where was the
spiritual guidance?

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.420 align:middle line:90%
Where was the synchronicity?

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:84%
I know in various places,
but how would you say--

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
what is the difference
between the synchronicity

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.030 align:middle line:90%
and the spiritual guidance?

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, synchronicity,
as Carl Jung describes it,

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
is a law of the universe that
just describes the way in which

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.700 align:middle line:84%
things are meaningfully
connected to each other that

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.220 align:middle line:84%
couldn't be explained by
physical cause and effect.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.990 align:middle line:84%
And Jung always pointed
out that these outer signs

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
need to correspond
to inner signs

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
as well, if it's
truly synchronistic.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Just the coincidence of noticing
that the baseball score today

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:14.390 align:middle line:84%
was 7 to 3, and
then you get home

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and you receive something
in the mail that

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
says you're lucky
number is 73, and then

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:84%
you are watching channel
73 on television tonight

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.835 align:middle line:84%
and something
interesting happens,

00:20:24.835 --> 00:20:26.210 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to know
how any of that

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to an
inner soul event.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So in the deepest sense,
that's not synchronistic.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But as I was wrestling with
this deep question of what

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
am I going to do with my life,
and as I'm having dreams,

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.753 align:middle line:84%
or in this case, a series of
dreams that's pointing the way,

00:20:40.753 --> 00:20:42.170 align:middle line:84%
and as there were
other signs that

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.910 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
things people said

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.397 align:middle line:84%
or somebody moving to
Virginia Beach right before me

00:20:46.397 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and saying if you ever
need a place to stay,

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.260 align:middle line:84%
even for a month at a time,
my house is open to you,

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.710 align:middle line:84%
those other little things
that fell into place to me

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:84%
were suggestive of this
being the right path for me.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're following
synchronistic events also.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.740 align:middle line:84%
If we've got a question and
wanting to find the answer,

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:84%
we pivot towards the
synchronistic events,

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.512 align:middle line:84%
paying attention to them
to know our next step.

00:21:08.512 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you can invite them, you
can make yourself more alert

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.100 align:middle line:84%
for them by doing something
like the "I Ching,"

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.330 align:middle line:84%
which is a 3,000 year old
Chinese Daoist divination

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.580 align:middle line:84%
method, where you
can throw coins--

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.620 align:middle line:84%
three coins six
consecutive times,

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and you, by the way they
fall heads and tails,

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:90%
build a hexagram.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you look in this book
of wisdom called the "I Ching,"

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:84%
because there's 64 possible
ways in which those tosses can

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:90%
turn out.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And in an uncanny,
synchronistic kind

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.330 align:middle line:84%
of way, what you read in
the book for the hexagram

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:84%
you've thrown is often
deeply related to the issue

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:43.160 align:middle line:90%
that you're wrestling with.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I've often heard it
said that God doesn't work

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.490 align:middle line:90%
in hypothetical situations.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But I'm wondering,
when you're getting

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.670 align:middle line:84%
the synchronistic
events and you're

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
paying attention to
them, that they can also

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:90%
direct you on the right path.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:84%
But could you also see
in synchronistic events

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe the steps that
you do not need to take?

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you can get
warnings, for sure.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I think you can get
indications that we can learn

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:90%
from whichever path we take.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.542 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, there's
never a wrong decision,

00:22:12.542 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
but that there's
something that can

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.208 align:middle line:90%
be learned from any decision.

00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:16.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:16.008 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> But there are some pathways
that are less painful,

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.990 align:middle line:84%
more graceful, and they
really optimize our learning.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think as we become
alert for these signposts,

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find the more
optimal way to chart our lives.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Mark Thurston, thank
you for being with us today.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Your book, among many others--

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:90%
is it 16, the total now?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:90%
Or we have a--

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.402 align:middle line:84%
"Synchronicity as Spiritual
Guidance, All of Life

00:22:39.402 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is Working Together to
Leave You Little Hints."

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.950 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being with us today.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for joining
us on a world of wisdom.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.280 align:middle line:90%
Until next time, stay tuned.
