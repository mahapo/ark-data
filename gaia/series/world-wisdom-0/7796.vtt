This is Elda Hartley of the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Elda has devoted and
dedicated her life

Welcome, Elda.

>> Happy to be here.

Well, we're looking forward
to having a lot more of you

00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
around the Wisdom
Channel here as you

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
work with us to provide all
the messages from your films.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to know, how long
have you been a filmmaker?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.030 align:middle line:10%
>> I have been in film
for more than 60 years.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.570 align:middle line:10%
But I've been a film
maker for about 30.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I mean doing the kind
of film that I have devoted

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:10%
my life to for
the last 30 years,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.640 align:middle line:10%
films that I used to
call films for a new age.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.180 align:middle line:84%
But now people seem to
think that new age--

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:90%
a lot of people--

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.583 align:middle line:84%
at least, it's had
bad press with some

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:90%
of the things that happened.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
There are always people on the
fringe, who give it a bad name,

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and publicists like
to play that up.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
But actually, the new age
is the old wisdom, really.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So my films have been about
the legends of the world,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to have people understand
that at the core of all

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.880 align:middle line:84%
the religions, it's the
same, that we really

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:84%
do love our neighbors
as ourselves,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
and to treat other people
as we'd like to be treated.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.710 align:middle line:90%
That's the basic.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:90%
That's basic to every religion.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
So we've made films on
all the major religions,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
and then we've
made a lot of them

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.190 align:middle line:84%
on alternative medicine, what
we used to call holistic health.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And on meditation and
everything to do with personal

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.360 align:middle line:84%
growth, with helping
us to become more,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.657 align:middle line:84%
to reach the consciousness
three as Reich said in his book.

00:02:55.657 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And you've traveled
throughout the world,

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and you've gotten
different cultures.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.983 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about some
of the variety of films

00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:90%
that you've made?

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I started
out doing films--

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
a film with Alan
Watts on Zen Buddhism

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and did six with him
before he died in '73.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I started doing
films on psychic research.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:90%
Elmer Green had come--

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
I'd done some work with
him, the Meniger foundation

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.760 align:middle line:90%
on biofeedback.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And then when Ed Mitchell
came back from the moon

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and had had this
religious experience.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.740 align:middle line:84%
He wanted to change
the world, because he

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.410 align:middle line:84%
had seen this big blue
marble out there that looked

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:90%
so beautiful from the moon.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to believe that
this gorgeous looking thing

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
when you get down to it
is full of so much strife.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.030 align:middle line:84%
So he wanted to
make a difference,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
and he formed an
organization which

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.860 align:middle line:84%
is now called the Institute
of Noetic Sciences.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been with them
from the very beginning.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.090 align:middle line:90%
I now serve on their board.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And I did do two films with
Ed when he first came back

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
on psychic research,
because there

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.090 align:middle line:84%
was a lot of psychic research
going on at that time.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:84%
The funding, though, kind
of dried up after time

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
from the things that
were being done.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
I did things with
[INAUDIBLE],, the great healer,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:90%
how she could take--

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:84%
as a healer, hold the water
in her hand and water plants

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And those plants
would grow better

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
than the ones that
didn't have this water.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was proving really that we
are so much more than we think

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:84%
we are, that we
really, all of us,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
have this potential to become
more, to become more in touch

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:84%
with the forces, the
energy that's out there,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:84%
trying to drive us to
make a better world.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But we get bogged down so
much by all the bad stuff

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.140 align:middle line:84%
that we see so much, so little
emphasis on the good stuff.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm so happy
to be involved with the Wisdom

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Channel, because we are
going to change the world.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:10%
We are going to bring
back the good views.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:10%
>> All right.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, we're certainly
glad to have you here.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:10%
And I'd just like
to ask you, too,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:10%
you're such an inspiration in
terms of your life's mission

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:10%
and purpose and using
this to fulfill.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:10%
Can you tell me--

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:10%
I know you've done some studies
on how people stay young,

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:10%
young at heart, young
physically, body, mind,

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:10%
and spirit.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.350 align:middle line:10%
You certainly are
an example of that.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:10%
What have you found in your
films and research about that?

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh I did that
film 10 years ago.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
It's called "Green Winter."

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was the last year
of my husband's life.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And he had gotten
so old, so old,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and was only a few
years older than I.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
examine why is it

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.460 align:middle line:84%
that I've been able to
stay as young as I have.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm 86.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And I still really
love life, you know?

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And his life has
become really a burden.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
because I have always

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
had this work that I
love so much, you know?

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It's having something to do
that you really love to do,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
because when I get
up in the morning,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to get started.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And an awful lot of
the people that I

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
know that are even younger than
I am, life is a bore to them,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.167 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
They don't know what
to do themselves.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what am I
going to do today?

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:90%
They wake up, you know?

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is a shame,
because here, they

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.370 align:middle line:84%
have arrived at a
time in their life

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
when it should be the
best years of their life.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
It really should
be, because they've

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
gotten past all that
period when they

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:84%
had to worry a lot about money
and bringing their children up

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.010 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
They're now at a spot
where they can really

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
begin to think about
their own growth,

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and that should give them
a lot to do every day.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:90%
>> You'd think.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What have you found in
visiting some of the different

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:90%
cultures?

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been to Soviet
Georgia and some other places,

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.938 align:middle line:90%
where people live many years.

00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Is there a common
denominator to longevity?

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:11.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there is.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that's really
important is to eat frugally.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.060 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat much.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.240 align:middle line:84%
They eat probably at
1,200 calories a day.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may be because
their economy doesn't allow

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.300 align:middle line:90%
them to eat very much more.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a lot
of fats and sweets

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
and things, no fast
food restaurants.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
They have to eat
what's available.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:90%
And they all continue to work.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And when they get too old to
go out and work in the fields--

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because most of these
are agrarian societies--

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.660 align:middle line:84%
they then can still feel
needed, because they

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.640 align:middle line:84%
can take care of the children
while their parents are out

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.440 align:middle line:90%
working.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe you say on that
film that work is a life

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:90%
enhancer.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it definitely is.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.770 align:middle line:90%
Work that you enjoy--

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.170 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be kind
of deadly to have a job you

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.430 align:middle line:90%
hated, but you see you--

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:84%
that's a matter
of your attitude.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.840 align:middle line:84%
You can make yourself like
whatever you're doing.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.780 align:middle line:90%
That's important, too.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I know we were talking
about before enlightenment,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.308 align:middle line:84%
after enlightenment,
the chop wood.

00:08:13.308 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to elaborate?

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, chop wood, carry water.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's all the
same before and after.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
I ran across an
acronym one time that's

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
PALACE in talking
about longevity.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:10%
It's P-A-L-A-C-E. Had
a positive attitude,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.540 align:middle line:10%
the ability to deal with
loss, being active, committed,

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:31.640 align:middle line:10%
and engaged.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's something I think
that really as a quick reminder

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.757 align:middle line:84%
and helps just what
you've been saying.

00:08:36.757 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very good.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.965 align:middle line:84%
I'll have to make
a note of that.

00:08:38.965 --> 00:08:40.565 align:middle line:90%
I'll do another film with that.

00:08:40.565 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:90%
>> The PALACE series.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:10%
But we were talking
about your films

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:10%
that you've done on
alternative healing

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:10%
and also on religions
of the world.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.730 align:middle line:10%
Can you tell us
some of the people

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:10%
that you have profiled
in those films?

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I did three
with Houston Smith.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't profiled
in it, you know.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:84%
I did one on Tibetan Buddhism,
the very first thing with him,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:13.170 align:middle line:84%
shot at a Tibetan refugee camp
in North India in Dalhousie.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And there, we
filmed these monks,

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
lamas who could sing chords,
who have since now been

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:84%
on the entertainment channel
here in the United States.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.530 align:middle line:84%
They were in New York just
a few months ago, you know,

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE] monks, who
one man can sing three notes

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:90%
at a time, you know?

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, Houston
discovered these monks

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
when he was in India the
year before, and he wrote us,

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and he had heard about
us because of the films

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.900 align:middle line:84%
with Alan Watts and said
that he was at that time,

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.920 align:middle line:84%
he was a professor
of philosophy at MIT.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.890 align:middle line:84%
And he had recorded them
when he was in India

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
and brought them back and put
them on all their machines

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to see that a monk really
could sing a chord.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.950 align:middle line:84%
So he wrote us and said that
these monks were so photogenic,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't we like to go with him?

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, my husband and I had--

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.370 align:middle line:84%
in our days of making
films for money,

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
we'd done a lot of sponsored
films for Pan American Airways.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So we were always
ready to travel.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Our passport is ready and
our bag is ready to go, too.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.200 align:middle line:10%
All I have to do is throw two
things in, and I'm ready to go.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:10%
So we said, sure, we'll go.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:10%
So we went off to do India
and filmed these monks.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:10%
And that was
"Requiem for Faith."

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:10%
Then Houston said, you know,
you should do something

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:10%
about Sufism.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what Sufism was.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, it happens to be the
mystical element of Islam.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
So I had an opportunity to go
with Inayat Khan [INAUDIBLE],,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.930 align:middle line:90%
no [INAUDIBLE] Khan.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
The father was [INAUDIBLE] to
his father's [INAUDIBLE],, which

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.100 align:middle line:90%
was in India.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And we traveled all over the
Islamic world in India, Turkey,

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.050 align:middle line:90%
Morocco, Tunisia, wherever.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.927 align:middle line:84%
And that film turned
out to win some awards.

00:11:09.927 --> 00:11:11.510 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
so did "Requiem."

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, all three
of those films won awards.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And the third one was
"India and the Infinite,"

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and that is all of the religions
of India, Hinduism, Buddhism,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Jainism, Zoroastrian,
the whole bit.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Also, to talk about your
book that you written that talks

00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
about the religions
of the world,

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.950 align:middle line:84%
the six major religions of
the world, "Perennial Wisdom."

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And that will certainly
be available for--

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.717 align:middle line:90%
can you tell us about the--

00:11:37.717 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, the film
was called "The Perennial

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Philosophy," and the book is
the narration of that film.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And the film has six
sequences of five minutes each

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:84%
of each of the major
religions, and again, showing

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.330 align:middle line:84%
that the core of all
religions is the same.

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:06.710 align:middle line:84%
The idea was to try to help us
realize that we are much more

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.600 align:middle line:90%
connected than we think.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We seem to have always the
things come up that divide us,

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
and we really are
truly are connected,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.720 align:middle line:84%
and we need to find that
out so that we can make

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.175 align:middle line:90%
this world much more peaceful.

00:12:20.175 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's a common thread
among all of the religions.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.455 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to make sure we
get a good shot of this book,

00:12:24.455 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:84%
because I particularly like
the fact that it has wisdom

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.910 align:middle line:90%
in the name.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You must have had
that planned long before

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:90%
our association.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, nothing
is an accident, you know.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.333 align:middle line:90%
>> There are no accidents.

00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:90%
>> No coincidences.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:37.797 --> 00:12:39.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we need to
take a quick break here.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.974 align:middle line:84%
But we'll be back in just
a minute with Elda Hartley.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.050 align:middle line:10%
We're back with Elda Hartley
now from the Hartley Film

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:10%
Foundation.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.290 align:middle line:10%
And I just wanted
to ask you, Elda,

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.827 align:middle line:10%
your films are distributed
in a variety of ways.

00:12:57.827 --> 00:12:59.535 align:middle line:84%
I know that, for
instance, hospitals have

00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:90%
used them, some of the healing.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Those are used
on closed circuit,

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:13.020 align:middle line:10%
and they're mainly meditation,
things that inspire meditation,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.740 align:middle line:10%
guided meditation for
the patients, you know.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And then some of the
others are mainly

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.902 align:middle line:84%
ideas about how to
stay healthy, you know.

00:13:25.902 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that's such
a testimonial to Western

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.030 align:middle line:84%
medicine, accepting some more
of the Eastern philosophies,

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.830 align:middle line:90%
perhaps.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.705 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a
real tribute to the fact

00:13:33.705 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
able to get that

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.580 align:middle line:84%
into the more conventional
mainstream, healing

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:90%
places, our hospitals.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I did the first film, "Holistic
Health and New Medicine," back

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.880 align:middle line:84%
before I even knew what
holistic health was,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:90%
and nobody else knew either.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.270 align:middle line:90%
But you know, it's grown.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:90%
It's in the mainstream.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is aware of holistic
health or alternative medicine.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Lots of books are
being written on it.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And as a matter of fact,
some of the best sellers

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:84%
now are books on
that whole subject.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think, too, when we're
seeing the transformation

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.760 align:middle line:84%
of medical doctors that
are going over into that,

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.292 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some very
popular people today

00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:16.500 align:middle line:84%
that are espousing some more
of the Eastern theories.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's just all bringing
lifestyle choices and changes

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:90%
into the whole of our being.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's not just
Eastern, because actually,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.780 align:middle line:84%
the idea is to treat the
body, mind, and spirit.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And most of the doctors in the
past, just treated the body,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, it was like
it was a machine.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:90%
And we really are all three.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have to know something
about the emotions that

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:84%
might have made that
person sick, you know?

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.430 align:middle line:84%
That has a lot to do
with your health is

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:90%
your attitude toward life.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:84%
I've heard it said,
too, that if you

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.770 align:middle line:84%
can get to the
source of right there

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.133 align:middle line:84%
with the emotional
conflict, that often,

00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:57.300 align:middle line:84%
things don't have to manifest
themselves physically.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And that has been brought
out without any question

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:02.970 align:middle line:90%
that it's true.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, doctors cannot pooh
pooh that idea anymore,

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:84%
because there have been too many
studies that show that if you

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.750 align:middle line:84%
get your act together
body, mind, and spirit,

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
you can many times bring
yourself back to health.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's so much
work, as you mentioned,

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that's being done
in that field today,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.360 align:middle line:84%
from Bernie Siegel,
who I know that you've

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.620 align:middle line:84%
done some films with, Dr.
Deepak Chopra, Andrew Weil.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.205 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people today are
out there with that message.

00:15:32.205 --> 00:15:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think just healing
and the whole self has so much

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:90%
to do with where we go today.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's very
encouraging that a channel,

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:52.500 align:middle line:84%
like Wisdom, is going to be
devoted to just this one thing

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.640 align:middle line:84%
of getting our body,
mind, and spirit together,

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.710 align:middle line:84%
because I think many people have
been crying for a long time.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult,
very difficult to get

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
any of the networks to play
these things because they feel

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
that they lose their audience,
that the average person is not

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:90%
really interested.

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are at
least 25 million people

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
in this country, who, once
they know about our channel,

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
will want to tune in, because
it's going to be all about just

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that, about how to
make yourself more,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.000 align:middle line:84%
how to be happier That's the
main thing, how to be happy.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:90%
And who isn't looking for that?

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's not as far
away as we might think.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:90%
It's within.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:90%
We can look within.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've been
indoctrinated with so much

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:90%
negativism in this culture.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's all
you see, really.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And we are brought
up on television.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And it's just full of
nothing but and criticism

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.190 align:middle line:90%
and putting people down.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you ever hear anybody
talking saying anything good

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:90%
about anybody?

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
It's always gossip, always
to put somebody down.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But we need to have people
that people can look up to.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.829 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the other
night, I needed

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.760 align:middle line:84%
to have something to inspire
me, so I went and got Gandhi.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.599 align:middle line:84%
That is the one film that's
been made in the last decade

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that I know over a long
time, it's really inspiring.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.300 align:middle line:84%
That man-- I mean, I could
look at that over and over,

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.633 align:middle line:90%
because he was so noble.

00:17:26.633 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
other noble people

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.182 align:middle line:84%
in the world right today,
but we don't hear about them.

00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And the Wisdom Channel is
going to bring those people

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.660 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.070 align:middle line:84%
And we know you're out
there, you 25 million people.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.210 align:middle line:90%
So this is the place to turn to.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And I think you're right.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's such a yearning
for this information and wisdom

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.140 align:middle line:90%
of the ages.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're excited to be able
to bring this programming

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.105 align:middle line:90%
to our viewers and listeners.

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:10%
If you could tell us
a little bit more,

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:10%
too, about the studies
that you've done with--

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.720 align:middle line:10%
let's do the
alternative religions,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.580 align:middle line:10%
or comparative
religions, that series

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.870 align:middle line:10%
that you've done on that.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.245 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a
little about that?

00:18:05.245 --> 00:18:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
perennial philosophy.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's the narration of from
that video is in that book

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.450 align:middle line:90%
that you showed.

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you anymore
about it than I already have,

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
unless you have a
specific question.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, just I know if we were
looking at it in your book,

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:31.145 align:middle line:84%
you go through the
six major religions.

00:18:31.145 --> 00:18:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Could you just outline
those, mentioned those for--

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you know what they are.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The three Western religions
Christianity, Judaism,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:90%
and Islam.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And the three Eastern religions
are Hinduism, Buddhism,

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.530 align:middle line:90%
and Taoism.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've capsulized
that pretty well.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.757 align:middle line:84%
And there's the universal
thread that flows through--

00:18:54.757 --> 00:18:55.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Through them all.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I like the--

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.670 align:middle line:84%
>> But the emphasis is
different, you know.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.010 align:middle line:90%
The emphasis is different.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, the emphasis
is on compassion.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.550 align:middle line:84%
In Christianity, the
emphasis is on love.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.230 align:middle line:84%
They're the same, but
a little different.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:84%
In compassion, it's
about putting yourself

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.150 align:middle line:90%
in the other person's shoes.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:84%
With love, it's a
feeling that you

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:84%
get that makes you love
everything and everybody.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.930 align:middle line:84%
It's difficult to
really describe,

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:38.340 align:middle line:84%
but many people have had
religious experiences,

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and they last for a
little while, you know?

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I had one when I was
about 18 years old.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.500 align:middle line:90%
It lasted for about three weeks.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I loved
everybody and everything,

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
and the world was
so beautiful, and I

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:84%
have been trying to
get that feeling back

00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:90%
for these 65 years.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that awful?

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And I've never felt able to
really get it back like that.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.462 align:middle line:84%
But the memory of it makes
me keep trying, you know?

00:20:08.462 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the things you've
talked about in terms of death

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and dying and near-death
experiences and how you really

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
don't have a fear of dying, and
if you could talk a little bit

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.220 align:middle line:90%
about that.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
if you don't fear death,

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
then it makes your life
here so much more pleasant.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- you
know, Christians really

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't fear death, because
we were told that we were going

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
to go to heaven if we were good,
and most of us try to be good.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And so why do we hang
on to it the way we do?

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
Why do people hang on
when really and truly,

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:90%
their life has lost all its--

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.210 align:middle line:84%
it's lost its usefulness
and its value, you know?

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that if they
weren't afraid of death,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:90%
they'd be willing to go, no?

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm kind of looking forward
to it to tell you the truth.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.270 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to leave.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.170 align:middle line:90%
I like it here now.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>> You have more work to do now.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and I'm in good health.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
But if I were ill, I would
think I would say, please,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:90%
let me get there.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Let me go and have a little
better life, you know?

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And I don't understand
why people feel--

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
they obviously do not
believe in life after death,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.150 align:middle line:84%
or they wouldn't hang
on the way they do.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's a shame, because
there's plenty of proof

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:90%
that there is life after death.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of proof.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:90%
Just go to the library.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:84%
Just ask the librarian
to direct you

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to some books that
talk about this.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:84%
There are just dozens of them,
and you can't read those books.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.720 align:middle line:84%
The one that I read lately was
so marvelous called "Letters

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:90%
from the Light."

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.460 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the
name of the author.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It is a judge who died and
wrote these letters back,

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and they're so meaningful.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I've given it to
friends of mine,

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.860 align:middle line:84%
who are on their
deathbed, and they all

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:84%
say it just does
them so much good.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:07.710 align:middle line:84%
That's a book we ought to
try to have on this program,

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:90%
because it's a wonderful book.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And nobody who read
that could possibly

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:84%
doubt that they're going to
continue and continue really

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.287 align:middle line:90%
in a very interesting life.

00:22:17.287 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you talk, too,
about that we're here to learn

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:90%
life's lessons.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And you may come back for that
till we learn those lessons.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.820 align:middle line:84%

It's not-- it wouldn't upset
me terribly if somebody proved

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:36.540 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't true, but I think
there's plenty of proof

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.650 align:middle line:90%
that it is true.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%

I'll get another chance,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
because I know I haven't
made it in this life time.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:45.600 align:middle line:84%

enlightened, and I

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.307 align:middle line:84%
intend to be enlightened
before I finish.

>> Well, we're certainly looking
forward to having you with us

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.880 align:middle line:84%
more on the Wisdom Channel and
fulfilling your life's purpose

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.780 align:middle line:90%
and mission.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:57.572 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for being
