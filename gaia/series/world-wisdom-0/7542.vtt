00:00:04.464 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello and welcome
to a "World of Wisdom."

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce was a Christian
mystic and a pioneer

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.550 align:middle line:90%
in holistic healing.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
He not only was a
spiritual guide or guru

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.660 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of his
people of that day,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
but he taught us in this
day so much about how

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
we can tap into our
own inner wisdom,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:90%
our own spiritual guidance.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
My guest today Dr. Mark Thurston
is the Executive Director

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.730 align:middle line:90%
for the Edgar Cayce Foundation.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:84%
And he is an author, a lecturer,
and I think a psychologist.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.023 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful for
you to be joining us today.

00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carolyn.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to zero in this
time together on this book,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.370 align:middle line:84%
"Synchronicity as
Spiritual Guidance."

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the lines in
here is, "All of life

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
is working together to
give you little hints."

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.440 align:middle line:84%
The intent underneath this
was to really help us all.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.200 align:middle line:84%
How has it helped your
own life in sorting out

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.880 align:middle line:90%
synchronicity events?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think in many ways
spiritual guidance has shaped

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
my life.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.602 align:middle line:10%
At the critical
junctures of my life,

00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:15.560 align:middle line:10%
as many people could say
about their own lives,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:10%
there have been little signs,
whether it came through a dream

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:10%
or prompting at the
end of meditation,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:10%
or an event or a series of
events happening around you,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:10%
or perhaps, words
that someone says

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:10%
that seemed to have wisdom
to them that didn't really

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:10%
intend to be as profound as
they were heard by you to be.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is a book
that was really

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.400 align:middle line:84%
meant to try to collect
some of those tools

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:84%
and some of those methods
into a handbook of sorts.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.800 align:middle line:84%
It's also tied back into an
Eastern form of guidance,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.190 align:middle line:84%
an oracle called the Yijing,
which some of your viewers

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
may have worked with
in their own lives.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
The Yijing is
thousands of years old,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
and it involves 64
different life themes that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
are created through the throwing
of coins or yarrow sticks,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and in a way, that seems
to be totally illogical,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.210 align:middle line:84%
one finds themselves
reading one of these 64 life

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.270 align:middle line:84%
themes and the guidance and
the message that's there.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And I took those themes and
found in the Cayce material

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.328 align:middle line:90%
those same principles.

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And so in this book,
there's a chance

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
to work with this
form of divination

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
or this kind of an
oracle, but also

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
bring in some of the words
of Edgar Cayce himself.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe a little later to get
into specifically how we look

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:10%
at the Yijing.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.940 align:middle line:10%
But tell us now, how do we
begin to develop the awareness

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:10%
of synchronicity in our life?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, synchronicity is a term
that was coined by the great

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that it
was a complementary law

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:90%
to the law of cause and effect.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
Like any good scientist, he saw
that cause and effect clearly

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.650 align:middle line:90%
governs much of materiality.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:84%
But he felt, especially
from watching

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
the experiences in
his own life and those

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
of his patients or his
clients, that oftentimes, there

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
was another
principle that seemed

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.030 align:middle line:84%
to be at work of
meaningful coincidences,

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
where things seem to happen
two or three or four times

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
in a way that
matched each other,

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:90%
but didn't cause each other.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And those kinds of
meaningful coincidences,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
when they related to a personal
issue or some sole pattern

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:84%
that we're wrestling with, often
had a certain guidance quality

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>> We also have in
developing our awareness,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
I know I hear this a lot, too,
and in my own life, practice,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.240 align:middle line:90%
practice, practice.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
We begin to trust that
we are receiving guidance

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.670 align:middle line:84%
through the various
ways, don't we?

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We do without
becoming superstitious.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And our willingness to be
alert for inner and outer signs

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.560 align:middle line:84%
to direct us and to guide
us shouldn't slip over

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:84%
into an abandonment of our
own rationality and our common

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.480 align:middle line:90%
sense.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:84%
We become superstitious
if we say, well, I'm

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.215 align:middle line:84%
going to do this
because a sign told me

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I ought to be doing it,
rather than asking ourselves,

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
does it measure up to the best
I know to be doing in my life?

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> One clue I know my own
life, if I had to defend it,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.477 align:middle line:90%
then there's something not--

00:05:07.477 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:84%
it's not really coming
from that true place,

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:84%
when I feel that I've got
to explain it or defend it.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:84%
But when it's really
a synchronistic event,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:90%
I know and trust it.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:90%
And I'm open for more, too.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a systematic enough
person that I've tried

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:84%
to assemble certain steps where
a person could work with either

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.510 align:middle line:84%
dream guidance or these kind
of outer signs or meditation

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:90%
guidance.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.045 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got an
eight step formula.

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, maybe we could
go over that briefly.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>> The first step is to get
real clear about your core value

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.500 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Cayce usually call that
setting a spiritual ideal.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But it's a matter
of asking yourself,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:84%
do I put peace at the
center of my life or love

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.880 align:middle line:84%
or oneness or creativity
or joyfulness?

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.150 align:middle line:84%
What's the core
value for your life?

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use
that as a measuring rod

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.385 align:middle line:84%
as we move through
the other steps.

00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:55.185 align:middle line:90%
>> You also give--

00:05:55.185 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I'll just stop you
just for one second.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.773 align:middle line:84%
You also give a way to
identify your core value, which

00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:02.690 align:middle line:90%
is real key, isn't it?

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> By going back to some of
your peak spiritual experiences.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Those have been hints to
you about your best self.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And if we'll recall those
peak moments in our lives,

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
they often give us an
inkling about what's

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:84%
really at the core of
our own spiritual nature.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>> An example of a
core spiritual value,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.142 align:middle line:90%
a core value would be like what?

00:06:20.142 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some of the
things I just named.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.220 align:middle line:84%
You could set peace
as a core value,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.932 align:middle line:84%
or fairness or
joyfulness or love,

00:06:26.932 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
or if you need a
few more words, it

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.350 align:middle line:84%
could be a phrase,
peaceful creativity,

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:90%
oneness with the Buddha.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can come
up with anything

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.980 align:middle line:90%
that feels right to us.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And would you just
have one core value,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:90%
or would you have several?

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>> There are certainly
supportive values and behaviors

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.200 align:middle line:90%
that grow out of that.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce's his
recommendation was

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
having a kind of focal point
or a kind of central value.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's open to
growth and development

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:90%
as the months and years go by.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So after you've clarified
your spiritual value?

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Second step is to
formulate the question.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we want
to skip over that step,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.223 align:middle line:84%
because we say, well, I
know what the question is.

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:07.180 align:middle line:84%
But actually writing it down
and getting clear what it is you

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.980 align:middle line:90%
want to know.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:90%
What's your question?

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Once you've got
that written down,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.780 align:middle line:84%
then a third step before you
start looking for guidance

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
is to do your homework
with your conscious mind.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Collect the facts.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Collect all the
information you can

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:90%
at a conscious, rational level.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.950 align:middle line:84%
And then at step four, make
a tentative decision, just

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:84%
a provisional decision
that uses rationality,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.300 align:middle line:84%
the analytical
mind, common sense.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And you say, without having
yet gotten any guidance

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
on this, what do I think
the best answer probably is?

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
But before you act on it,
then the remaining steps

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
involve working with
inner and outer guidance.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So with step five, we
begin to watch our dreams.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.660 align:middle line:84%
We begin to ask at the end of
a prayer, meditation session

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.610 align:middle line:90%
for some type of a prompting.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
We begin to watch for
signs in the outer world.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.540 align:middle line:84%
We begin to perhaps
consult with a friend

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.822 align:middle line:90%
or professional intuitive.

00:08:03.822 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
There are many different
ways, consulting

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.730 align:middle line:84%
an Yijing or the runes or
many of these other oracles.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:84%
And then as we collect
this information,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:84%
and we begin to assemble
it, the next step

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is then to formulate what we
feel like is a guided decision.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we're beginning to
put together rationality

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.808 align:middle line:90%
and intuition as well.

00:08:24.808 --> 00:08:26.350 align:middle line:84%
And as we come up
with something that

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
feels like a guided decision,
that in step number seven,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.140 align:middle line:84%
we want to measure
that and make sure

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:84%
it's consistent with
our spiritual ideal.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And this is just sort
of a silly example,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.610 align:middle line:84%
but one time at a workshop
on meditation for guidance,

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.679 align:middle line:90%
a woman went into meditation.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:44.277 align:middle line:90%
She had a question.

00:08:44.277 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
The workshop leader said,
now, at the end of meditation,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.095 align:middle line:84%
pose your question inwardly
and listen for an answer.

00:08:50.095 --> 00:08:51.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said later
that she heard

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
a little voice that said, why
don't you just kill yourself?

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, she asked the workshop
presenter afterwards,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.400 align:middle line:90%
what should I do?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And if she doesn't
have a step in there

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
where she takes what looks to
be something coming from within,

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.900 align:middle line:84%
but then ask does it measure
up to my spiritual ideal,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
then she's going to act on
something that surely is not

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:90%
coming from her best self.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Surely that's coming from
her subconscious and some kind

00:09:16.698 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:84%
of a fear or insecurity
or self-doubt.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.740 align:middle line:84%
>> What did she do with
that then at that point?

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:84%
She measures it
against her ideal.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And if it doesn't measure up,
then you go back and you look

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:90%
for guidance further.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:90%
We all--

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:90%
>> And explore that message?

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And you would explore
that message--

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did that
message come from?

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
That could be part of the
clearing out or the cleansing

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.710 align:middle line:84%
process in order to allow
the more accurate intuition

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.120 align:middle line:90%
to come through.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
I always encourage
people to work, though,

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.260 align:middle line:90%
with multiple forms of guidance.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Don't just look at your dreams.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Don't just consult the Yijing.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Don't just watch for
synchronistic signs.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't just meditate
for guidance.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.970 align:middle line:84%
Try to get two or
three or four streams,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
and then see if they
begin to dovetail.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes like my
fingers fitting

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.390 align:middle line:84%
together, one
builds on the other,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and you get a fabric where you
get a bigger picture, a more

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
comprehensive understanding.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the eight
steps, we're asking--

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The eighth we need
to add, which is to act

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.440 align:middle line:90%
on the guidance.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Go ahead.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the eight steps,
that we are asking--

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:24.630 align:middle line:84%
we have a definite formula for
discerning spiritual guidance,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:84%
but we have to be pretty
specific, don't we?

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to be specific
with that question.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.940 align:middle line:84%
We need to be discerning
with what comes.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
We need, as we act,
which is step eight,

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.940 align:middle line:84%
also leave the channels
for further guidance open.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes what comes
to us sort of points us

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
in the general direction, and
then as we begin to act on it,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
another dream can come or a
further prompting in prayer

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
life can come or another
synchronistic set of signs

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.060 align:middle line:84%
can come that kind of
refines that guidance.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And so it's, in a sense, a
flow that keeps recycling.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And Mark, it appears
that it's continually asking

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
the individual to go to the
their inner self to really

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
check in right there,
moment by moment.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:84%
It's not about, well,
I've got this information,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.523 align:middle line:84%
now I can go forward, but
really to check it out.

00:11:16.523 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I think spiritual
guidance becomes a matter

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:84%
of your lifestyle
on a daily basis.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you won't
walk out of your bedroom

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:84%
until you have gotten
a voice from somewhere.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But it just means you build
into your daily rhythm,

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.400 align:middle line:84%
just as surely as you build in
eating or watching the evening

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
news or looking at the
newspaper, time for quiet to

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.980 align:middle line:90%
tune in.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.762 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we take a
moment for a break,

00:11:41.762 --> 00:11:44.780 align:middle line:84%
what do people do when they get
guidance that they think is not

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.700 align:middle line:84%
for themselves and
maybe for someone else?

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Edgar Cayce was asked that.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:90%
>> We give ideas.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
We tell everybody else how
they need to live their life.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.073 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps we have
received something.

00:11:55.073 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I liked what Edgar Cayce said
when he was asked that question

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.780 align:middle line:90%
in one of his readings.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, be willing to
share the information,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.107 align:middle line:90%
but never force the issue.

00:12:05.107 --> 00:12:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So if I had a dream, maybe
you appear in my dream,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
it's possible you just
symbolize an aspect of myself.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
But maybe there's a telepathic
element to the dream.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I might be willing to
share the dream with you,

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:84%
and if you immediately
give me signs

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.825 align:middle line:84%
that you're defensive about
it being about you at all,

00:12:19.825 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
force the issue.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll back off.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you show that
you'd like to explore

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.540 align:middle line:84%
that it may be a
psychic dream, I'll

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.130 align:middle line:84%
take it as far as
you want to go.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> And would we always know?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we may not even
be sure if it is about me

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.820 align:middle line:84%
or if it's about someone else
until we begin to trust that.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I would like to take a little
bit and talk about telepathy

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other things
included in "Synchronicity

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:90%
as Spiritual Guidance."

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:84%
We need to take a
break right now.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft speaking
with Dr. Mark Thurston,

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.950 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be back
in just a moment.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:54.870 align:middle line:90%
And welcome back.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm speaking with Dr. Mark.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Thurston, the author of
"Synchronicity as Spiritual

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Guidance," and we were talking
about synchronicity and how

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
it shows up, how we receive
some of our spiritual guidance,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and you've, in your
book, highlighted

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:90%
a number of different ways.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Why don't we begin
with meditation

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and how do we use
meditation to increase

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.010 align:middle line:84%
our synchronicity events or
at least be aware of them?

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we can get guidance
directly in meditation,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.850 align:middle line:84%
in addition to our meditation
life making us more alert

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.010 align:middle line:84%
and sensitive to the
things going on around us,

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:90%
that may be presenting guidance.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a specific
meditation time,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
whether it's five minutes
or 10 minutes or longer,

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
at the very end of
that quiet focus time,

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.840 align:middle line:90%
you can pose a question.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:10%
You're can ask a question
to your inner self,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:47.200 align:middle line:10%
and then be open and
receptive to a response.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.700 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you've asked
the question so

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:10%
it can be answered yes or no--

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.930 align:middle line:10%
and that's what Cayce
often recommended--

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.360 align:middle line:10%
then we can sometimes get
a feeling of rightness

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:10%
or a feeling of
warning, depending

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.940 align:middle line:10%
upon what our inclination
is terms of a decision.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Even a body response.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's a
pressure in a certain part

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:90%
of their body.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:84%
For some people, it's
just an emotional feeling.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.472 align:middle line:84%
But in that eight
step procedure,

00:14:09.472 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
you'll recall that
one of the steps

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.270 align:middle line:84%
was a kind of provisional
or tentative decision.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And so you may get some feedback
of rightness or wrongness

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:90%
about that tentative decision.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.700 align:middle line:84%
If your question
is more open-ended,

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.572 align:middle line:84%
like should I moved
to California,

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:25.030 align:middle line:84%
that would be a
yes or no question.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.710 align:middle line:84%
If your question
was more open-ended,

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
like should I change jobs, and
what should I do if I change,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.590 align:middle line:84%
then what comes in meditation
could be an answer.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
You may hear a
still, small voice.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
You may suddenly
have a memory that

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:84%
is relevant to what you're
dealing with right now.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:84%
You may move in consciousness
where you look back

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.580 align:middle line:84%
at the problem from
a different angle

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:90%
or a different perspective.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>> New perspective, yeah.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.373 align:middle line:84%
>> And that different
perspective helps you to see

00:14:52.373 --> 00:14:54.580 align:middle line:90%
your own answer more clearly.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Or you may get nothing at all.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:90%
And that often happens for me.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet having made
the effort makes

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.220 align:middle line:84%
me more alert in daily life
for it coming through a sign

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
or makes me more sensitive to
receiving a dream that night.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:10%
You know, when I
was reading this,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:10%
it brought up a method that
I have used that I think ties

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:10%
in with the fourth idea,
inspirational writing somewhat.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But often when I've
got something major,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.210 align:middle line:90%
I'll do a 40 day journal.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed in the
different ways of receiving

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.880 align:middle line:84%
spiritual guidance
through meditation

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.000 align:middle line:84%
or upon meditating on
that specific question,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.130 align:middle line:84%
that you may get your
answer the day later,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.990 align:middle line:84%
or it may be 40 days
later or an hour later.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Something is incubating
in us, and the intention,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
the desire for an answer,
the meditative work we do,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:84%
other spiritual disciplines
we do may just set something

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.595 align:middle line:84%
in process that could take
weeks before it really hatches.

00:15:53.595 --> 00:15:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this what you say to
someone that says I want

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.110 align:middle line:84%
an answer and I want it
now, and they get nothing?

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I say trust that you've
really started a process going.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and the time and
season is very much a factor,

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.900 align:middle line:90%
God's time.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes we're not
ready to hear the answer.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes the answer would
be so disarming to us that

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.510 align:middle line:84%
it's going to take a matter
of time and maturation before

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:84%
we're really ready to hear
the answer and act on it.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I talk about baby steps,
but you talk about increments.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:84%
Incrementally there
are times when,

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
if we receive the
whole answer, like

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.990 align:middle line:84%
you're saying, it might
be somewhat devastating,

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and we have to experience
some small baby steps

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
or letting go of this or letting
go of that or facing a fear.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the right answer isn't--

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.028 align:middle line:90%
we're not quite ready.

00:16:38.028 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I've noticed that especially
in working with my own dreams

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and working with other people on
their dreams that we want just

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.190 align:middle line:90%
the dream that answers it.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, especially
when we've had one that gave

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.380 align:middle line:90%
an answer at one time.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are occasions
where we get the big dream.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> But more often, dreams
come like layers to deepen

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.900 align:middle line:90%
our understanding.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And you look at a series of
dreams that incrementally

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:90%
reveal the guidance.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And so we may need to
keep a dream journal.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.185 align:middle line:84%
We may need to have a dream
journal and then a place

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:08.560 align:middle line:84%
where we're also doing the
inspirational writing that you

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.790 align:middle line:90%
referred to.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:84%
So these guidance modalities
can kind of interact

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and in a synergistic
way support each other.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Mark, I continue
to get the idea of trusting,

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.260 align:middle line:84%
just to trust that any of these
steps might be one and all

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.880 align:middle line:84%
of these steps are
the one, the ones.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned with
dreams and guidance,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:90%
you get a new perspective.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
But there are other kinds
of dreams that we have.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we have precognition
or something like that.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we can have
precognitive dreams,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:84%
thinking back again to
that eight step sequence,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.502 align:middle line:84%
where the fourth step was
to set a tentative decision.

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But you're not going to act on
it, until you've checked out

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:90%
with guidance sources.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
We may have a dream
that, in essence, says

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.050 align:middle line:84%
here's what's likely
to unfold in your life

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.745 align:middle line:84%
if you follow your
tentative decision.

00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And then based on what you're
seeing there in that dream,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.953 align:middle line:84%
you can get a sense of
whether you're headed

00:18:05.953 --> 00:18:07.935 align:middle line:90%
down the right road or not.

00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I would like
to reiterate, too,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:84%
that often the dream sort of
has an open ended nature to it,

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
that you mentioned in the
book that there are steps.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So there are times when you
don't have the full answer,

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
but you've got a most
powerful insightful dream

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:28.013 align:middle line:84%
or a vision that gives you
only that next step to take.

00:18:28.013 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:84%
>> And then as you act on it,
perhaps the next step can be

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.605 align:middle line:90%
revealed to you.

00:18:31.605 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Other times, the dream
only takes you deeper

00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:35.210 align:middle line:90%
into the question.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:36.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.272 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes you deeper
into the of your life,

00:18:38.272 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:84%
even though there are occasions,
and we love to have these,

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:84%
where a dream is like a little
message being slipped under

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.610 align:middle line:84%
your bedroom door at
night or a fortune cookie,

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.070 align:middle line:84%
where you open it up, and
it says, here's what to do.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:84%
On other occasions,
dreams just take

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.410 align:middle line:84%
us deeper into the soul mind and
into the mystery of who we are,

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:57.860 align:middle line:84%
but that deepening of
the question, sometimes

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:84%
is what's required before
an answer can ever emerge.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was going through my
divorce, I wanted to answer,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:90%
you know, whether--

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:90%
do we stay together, do we not.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.740 align:middle line:90%
I was really wanting an answer.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I had a dream of
some antique furniture

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that I absolutely loved, but
they were small little pieces,

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:90%
and they grew.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:90%
They were like larger.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And upon reflection after
that, part of the message

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.220 align:middle line:84%
was that there were going
to be more things that I

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:90%
was going to be dealing with.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And it did feel
very heavy before I

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:84%
got to the place
of the real answer.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:90%
But I was just so frustrated.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.757 align:middle line:90%
I wanted the answer.

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to know exactly what
it was going to look like.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would bet that dream,
along with some other signs

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.680 align:middle line:84%
that you got or prayer
life promptings led you

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:90%
to a decision.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Most definitely.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to people
that say they don't dream?

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I say, I believe you that
you don't remember your dreams.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I certainly can't discount
the way you're experiencing

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.570 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:84%
But there's pretty
reliable sleep and dream

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:84%
laboratory research to
show that we're all having

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.420 align:middle line:90%
these experiences at night.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And psychology is
not really clear

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.388 align:middle line:84%
why some people don't
remember dreams very often.

00:20:07.388 --> 00:20:08.930 align:middle line:84%
There's been a little
bit of research

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to suggest it's
motivated forgetting.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So there may be some motive
why we don't remember.

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps as a child, we
had traumatic dreams.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And so something in our
minds associates dreaming

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
with scary experiences,
or maybe something in us

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
senses that there's stuff just
beneath the surface that's

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.680 align:middle line:84%
coming out in our dreams we're
not ready to deal with yet.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the recollection
is blocked.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And there are ways to
help someone who maybe

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
isn't remembering their dreams,
as long as the motivation is

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.210 align:middle line:84%
there to want to know what
their dreams are revealing.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.440 align:middle line:84%
They can put a
journal by their bed

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.080 align:middle line:84%
or to say to the subconscious
I'm ready to receive.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I encourage people to
have their dream journal

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:84%
and to write something
in it in the morning,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
even if it's just how they
were feeling when they woke up.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Or take your question
with you to bed.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe write it on
a piece of paper.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:90%
Put it under your pillow.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:90%
You wake up in the morning.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.680 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's no dream.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But your mind's been working
on that issue during the night.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:90%
And what is your intuition?

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.527 align:middle line:84%
What's your prompting
in the morning?

00:21:10.527 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And your dreams may
have played a role

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:84%
in shaping that prompting,
even if you've forgotten

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.530 align:middle line:90%
the details of the dream.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.040 align:middle line:90%
Write that prompting down.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Good advice.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:90%
Professional intuitives.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Going to a psychic to
help you with your problem

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.400 align:middle line:90%
or your question.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, what do you say?

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that can play an
important role for many people.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, over 43
years, Edgar Cayce

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.600 align:middle line:84%
was help people to
help a lot of people.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.490 align:middle line:84%
I have over the years
gotten readings on occasion.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:39.700 align:middle line:84%
I think you can become
dependent upon a psychic

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.450 align:middle line:84%
where you don't make
any move in your life

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:84%
until you've consulted
your psychic.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.330 align:middle line:84%
In the research work that I've
done with some colleagues,

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
we found that people were
most satisfied with what

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.970 align:middle line:84%
they got from psychic readings
if they would ask questions

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that requested more information,
rather than asking psychics

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.160 align:middle line:90%
to give decisions.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And so let's suppose I'm
dissatisfied in my career.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Instead of asking the psychic
what job should I change to,

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I instead say, what
are my sole talents

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.470 align:middle line:84%
that I need to find some way
of weaving into my life's work?

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I ask that
kind of question,

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm more likely to be
satisfied with the help

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:84%
that intuitive or that
psychic is going to give me,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
rather than turning over to
them the decision making process

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.565 align:middle line:90%
in my life.

00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carolyn.

00:22:28.357 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>> For being here.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
recommend to our viewers

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:84%
to look for more information
on "Synchronicity as Spiritual

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:37.790 align:middle line:90%
Guidance--

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.450 align:middle line:84%
All of Life is Working Together
to Leave You Little Hints."

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:84%
We've just tapped into a
little bit of this today.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.170 align:middle line:84%
Also, "Millennium Prophecies--
Predictions for the Coming

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Century" from Edgar Cayce.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And Mark, this
has been a delight

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:52.770 align:middle line:90%
speaking with you today.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for
joining us in wisdom.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.095 align:middle line:84%
And thank you on a
"World of Wisdom."

00:22:57.095 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And until next time,
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.520 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you then.
