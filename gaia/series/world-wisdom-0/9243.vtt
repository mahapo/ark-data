00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:05.456 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.456 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:90%


00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:90%
My name is Linda Rachel.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to the
"World of Wisdom."

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Today we have, as our
special guest, Guy Finley,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.330 align:middle line:84%
who is the author of a new
book, "The Intimate Enemy."

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.650 align:middle line:90%
Guy, welcome to our show.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.807 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Today I'd like for us to talk
a little bit about your book.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you would,
if you could give us

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.560 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of a
background about how

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:84%
you got into this field of
self-help and self-discovery,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
what was it in your own
background that brought you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.270 align:middle line:90%
to this realization?

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know
of a specific instance.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
It was, for me, from the
time that I was small enough

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that there was
these terrible inconsistencies

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
between the people
that I was raised with,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
and around what they
said was good and true,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and how they felt,
and how they acted,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
there was this huge gulf
that I couldn't reconcile.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:10%
And as I continued to
grow up, I continued

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:10%
to have more and
more experiences that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:10%
proved to me that, taken at
face value, just what you see

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.720 align:middle line:10%
and what you're
told, that I would

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:10%
make a terrible
mistake if I tried

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.450 align:middle line:10%
to find myself in that life.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it became imperative that
I begin reading and studying.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.310 align:middle line:90%
And I traveled.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's been one sort of a
wild, fruitful, and grateful

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.630 align:middle line:84%
adventure for me,
this spiritual life.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and your father was
a pioneer in radio, talk show.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.065 align:middle line:84%
>> And and you grew up
in Hollywood, around--

00:02:52.065 --> 00:02:54.430 align:middle line:90%
>> (SINGING) Hollywood.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And with these people
as you were growing up,

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.490 align:middle line:84%
do you think that had a major
influence on your life then?

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I like to think that the
advantage that I had was that--

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.620 align:middle line:90%
and how do I say this?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not being acrimonious.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.250 align:middle line:84%
This is not putting
anything down,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.180 align:middle line:84%
but I was born at the
top of the garbage heap.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I was.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I had every advantage
a child could have.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in an
affluent family.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.540 align:middle line:84%
My father, whenever, wherever
we went-- it wasn't just radio.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
He invented late-night
television talk

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
show before Jack Paar
and Johnny Carson.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I had an access
to a world that,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:84%
by and large, everyone on this
planet, in one way or another,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:90%
aspires to, almost everyone.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet there I
was, and all I saw

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.800 align:middle line:84%
was anger, and fear, and
nervousness, and addictions

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:90%
of one kind or another, a dis--

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.000 align:middle line:90%
to use a popular word--

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.410 align:middle line:84%
one giant, dysfunctional
society that I could see I

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.210 align:middle line:90%
don't belong here.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not doing
anything for them.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Why would I go into it?

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't go
into that, which

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:84%
in one respect, the creative,
social ladder towards the top

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.410 align:middle line:90%
of the world, where do you go?

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:84%
So it turned out to be not
outward for me, but inward.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And that, it did drive
the point home for me.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the problems
that many people in the world

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:84%
see today, and
especially parents,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
is that outwardly they
are living lives that

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.620 align:middle line:84%
aren't fulfilled, and
they're not finding meaning.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to find meaning
through attachment to things,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
the money, the work,
or recognition.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And the young people
who are coming up

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
see that this isn't bringing
them that necessary element

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.990 align:middle line:90%
of self-importance.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And how do we speak
to these parents

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.460 align:middle line:90%
and to these young people?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to begin with, what
you're saying is so true.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:10%
There is such a
disenfranchisement.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.210 align:middle line:10%
And the younger people are so
disenchanted with the world

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:10%
that we're getting
ready to hand them.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And yet don't you see?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The same-- it just
keeps repeating itself.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.080 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I talk about

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:90%
is what it means to learn.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
How can you tell anyone
what they should do?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
All right, let's
make this personal.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I hope I don't get too personal.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's fine.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you ever been really
in a bad mood or depressed?

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And then a friend
called, and they said,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm in the worst way.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:90%
What can you do?

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.440 align:middle line:90%
How can you help me?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And then you just pick
yourself up off the floor.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And here you are telling
someone else what

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.090 align:middle line:90%
to do to make their life work.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And we don't see any
contradiction in that.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm suicidal, and you call me.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I know,
I'm telling you what to do,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
how to be a happy person.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.850 align:middle line:84%
See, it takes a healthy person
to help a person get healthy.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.670 align:middle line:90%
So our work is a self-work.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:90%
It's an individual work.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.257 align:middle line:90%
And it is not a selfish work.

00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:10.840 align:middle line:84%
This is one thing I
hear all the time.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, isn't this
selfish if you just

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
work for yourself, and on
yourself, and toward yourself?

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:84%
It's selfish if the end result
is that somehow or other

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm going to be some
glorified being, that flowers

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:84%
are going to bloom behind me
when I walk down the street.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But if the work that I'm
doing is educating me

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.610 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that within me
is dwelling something that

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.400 align:middle line:84%
can't wait to give bad
information because it makes

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.450 align:middle line:84%
me look good, that can't
wait to believe in itself

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
as an answer to a present
pain that I have, then

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
I can begin to do
for my children

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
and for the young
people that I'm

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.140 align:middle line:84%
involved with what no
one has done for them,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:90%
which is simply tell the truth.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Say, look, things aren't right.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I know that I'm part
of what isn't right.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But by God, and I
mean that reverently,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I am beginning to
understand what

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I need to do to put it right.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And it begins with stopping
this blame business.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And it begins with the end of
this investment that all of us

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.520 align:middle line:84%
have in the next thrill,
the next excitement.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when's it going to end?

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
the pattern of things,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:84%
the way the world is
going, our thrill meter

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:84%
is escalating and escalating
to the point where,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle line:84%
my god, the things you
can see on television now,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and it looks like it's
broadcast from hell itself.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And we don't notice
the difference

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
because we need
increasing thrills

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
to get us through the
disenfranchisement

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:84%
and the disenchantment we
have with our present life.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So the beginning of it is for
the children, for human adults,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to start being honest,
to start saying,

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
look, I didn't do it right.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to work
to find out what is true.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
follow me, but let's

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:84%
you and I agree to
learn what is true.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And if we'll do
that, then, surely,

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.940 align:middle line:84%
fearlessness, confidence,
and real success will follow.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.930 align:middle line:84%
And it will because we're
willing to put the truth first.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think part of the problem
is that we are afraid of not

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.508 align:middle line:90%
having all the answers.

00:08:11.508 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you hit a big one.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're afraid
of not being right.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you hit a big one.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Does fear know
anything intelligent?

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:90%
See, that's the intimate enemy.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid not to
know the answer.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I will supply
myself with any answer

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:90%
that seems to fit the moment.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Take the drink.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.750 align:middle line:90%
Say the cruel thing.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.299 align:middle line:90%
Buy the thing you can't afford.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Agree that loneliness is
your doom and the prophecy

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.980 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Because that answer, at least,
I recognize myself within it.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that who we
are doesn't need an answer

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:84%
it recognizes as being true
because the very absence

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.030 align:middle line:90%
of fear is truth.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:90%
So you see the difference?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
One, I'm listening to fear tell
me what answers are possible,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.870 align:middle line:84%
what will work, where I
can find myself and be safe

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
finding myself that way.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.170 align:middle line:84%
The other answer shows me that
fear can't know anything good,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and to drop the
fear, and then allow

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%
the momentary loss of myself--

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:84%
listen to this-- to be replaced
with a new sense of self that

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:84%
floods into me that
is free of the fear

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.910 align:middle line:84%
that I was having
a moment before.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.614 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to protect myself.

00:09:34.614 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you
think that this is--

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:90%
what is the opposite of fear?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.252 align:middle line:90%
Is it love?

00:09:40.252 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes and no.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
In this world-- and we
can just put it this way.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Right now, what
happens is a person

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.440 align:middle line:84%
goes through a terrible
moment of some kind.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's say they're
afraid of their future.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So they come up with
the idea, and they

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:84%
start doing this imagination
work where they're coming up

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
with a loving scene,
the sound of the waves,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and all of the things that
we use as affirmations.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And that has a
place, for instance,

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.050 align:middle line:90%
in healing the physical body.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.790 align:middle line:84%
There are certain techniques
visually that are important.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
freeing ourselves,

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.030 align:middle line:90%
which has be the aim--

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
because without freedom,
there can't be love--

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:84%
then that kind of
love is not something

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.330 align:middle line:84%
that comes to us out of
resisting a painful state.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:84%
See, we tend to want God,
love, Christ, light in our life

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
when we tend to have
the darkness, the fear,

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:90%
and the worries.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And these moments where,
suddenly, I'm looking out,

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.030 align:middle line:90%
and I want to have truth.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.590 align:middle line:84%
I want to walk in
the steps of Jesus

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that I
say is this truthful life.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.810 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, I am actually
being sent out, as it were,

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:90%
from a fearful state.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And my longing for this
moment where I won't be afraid

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.230 align:middle line:90%
perpetuates the fear itself.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.350 align:middle line:84%
It takes true
spiritual courage that

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
is born out of spiritual
wisdom, spiritual knowledge,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.470 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that if
I plant a lemon seed,

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to grow a lemon tree--

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and not know whether or not
a peach tree is going to grow

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:84%
but, by God, refuse to
water the lemon seed.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And when you start doing
that, the weed seed dies.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And in its place, believe
me-- you know the manna that

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:90%
came down to Moses?

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, the water from the
rock, all of that business?

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.950 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is get
the garden freed and cleared

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.520 align:middle line:84%
of all the stuff that
the wrong parts of us,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.820 align:middle line:84%
that the intimate enemy, keep
us nourishing, and fertilizing,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and then sustaining
ourselves on,

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.620 align:middle line:84%
which only sustains that
wrong part of ourself.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, is denial a big part
of the intimate enemy in that we

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:84%
deny that we have a
problem with something,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:84%
or that we deny that
we are at war at all,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:84%
just by saying that
it's not there,

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that we hope that
it's going to go away.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Denial is a large river
that runs through the--

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:07.750 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a joke-- denial.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:90%
Denial.

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I get it.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Denial is a huge
part of this problem.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the machine that
drives the circle of self.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.070 align:middle line:90%
And what is denial other than--

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.930 align:middle line:90%
let's take a negative state.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Denial is on the
false part of myself,

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.900 align:middle line:84%
this intimate
entity, the refusal

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:90%
that says, oh, boy I better--

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.660 align:middle line:84%
gee, if I go into that meeting
dressed in this outfit--

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.580 align:middle line:90%
this is just a simple example--

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.928 align:middle line:84%
everybody's going to
see that I'm an idiot.

00:12:45.928 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, and
people maybe they

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:84%
think that they
don't think that way.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
We're always concerned
with the way we look.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many times have you
and I dressed to the nines,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.450 align:middle line:90%
to use an old expression.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And instead of being more
comfortable in a meeting,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.550 align:middle line:84%
found ourselves
more uncomfortable?

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, denial is something
that operates in us when

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:84%
we refuse to see that
that solution to that pain

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:90%
doesn't provide any real relief.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do?

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.220 align:middle line:84%
We just keep going
back through it.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:18.663 align:middle line:84%
But what's the machinery in
it is that the pain comes up,

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:20.830 align:middle line:84%
and the fear comes up, and
it says, but you have to.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.060 align:middle line:90%
You've got to change that shirt.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.977 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do this.

00:13:22.977 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:90%
You gotta do that.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
And that pain drives
us around and around

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:32.475 align:middle line:84%
and around, and we deny the
fact that that answer works.

00:13:32.475 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:84%
If we could wake
up a little bit,

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.443 align:middle line:84%
we'd see that answer doesn't
work, drop it, and go on

00:13:36.443 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:84%
to something that
does, which is letting

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
go of the whole wrong
idea that who we are

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
depends upon what other
people think about us,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.477 align:middle line:90%
just as one example.

00:13:44.477 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to
take a little break.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll come
back and go further

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
into the insights of
"The Intimate Enemy."

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:58.940 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the
"World of Wisdom."

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:84%
We're here with Guy Finley,
author of "The Intimate Enemy."

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
some of the insights

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.110 align:middle line:84%
in helping us to understand the
negative states that we find

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.200 align:middle line:84%
ourselves in and to
understand how we can

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.790 align:middle line:90%
take charge of our thoughts.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Guy, it's nice to have you here.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:17.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:20.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Guy, one of the things that
we've talked about is the fact

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:10%
that some of the thoughts that
we have can seem to multiply,

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:10%
and almost like multiple
personalities that we have

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:10%
as they take control of
us or take charge of us.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We even have expressions
like, the devil made me do it,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.290 align:middle line:84%
or I don't know
what got into me.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:90%
Just something came over me.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know why I thought
that way or why I said that

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:45.450 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it that we can take
charge of these negative states

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.240 align:middle line:90%
that we get in?

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The simple answer is by
getting sick and tired of being

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:10%
someone who always feels sick
and tired after they've done

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:10%
something they
didn't want to do.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:10%
And really, the spiritual
life, in a way, is very simple.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I like to say that the child
finds the classroom when he

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.720 align:middle line:90%
or she tires of the playground.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Our sense of self that comes
from having said stupid things

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.090 align:middle line:84%
to someone else or to ourselves,
the sense of that self,

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.240 align:middle line:84%
eventually, it gets so
wearisome, so tired.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.630 align:middle line:84%
You get so tired of being
tired and frightened and tired

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:90%
of being anxious.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.450 align:middle line:84%
At a certain point,
that's the simple answer.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But there are
spiritual principles.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.180 align:middle line:84%
There are great truths
that are available

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:84%
for a sincere
individual that can

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.667 align:middle line:90%
lend to that person certain--

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to hesitate
to use the word "powers"

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.410 align:middle line:84%
because it's not their power
any more than it's the plane's

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.970 align:middle line:90%
power that lifts it.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.300 align:middle line:84%
The rules for being
lifted exist already,

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:84%
just as the hawk uses
the solar eddies to rise.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you go out and you
look at a beautiful sunset,

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.560 align:middle line:84%
in the moment of that awareness,
are you not exchanging

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.840 align:middle line:90%
something with that sunset?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Isn't there, in the awareness,
an energy that you bring to it,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and that the sunset
itself has, and that there

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
is a definite exchange that
takes place between you

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:90%
and the thing you're aware of?

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.785 align:middle line:90%
Or you agree with me?

00:16:19.785 --> 00:16:20.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:20.585 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.400 align:middle line:84%
That means that at
the moment that I

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:28.470 align:middle line:84%
can be aware of anything,
it is possible for me

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.650 align:middle line:84%
to experience an
exchange of energy

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.690 align:middle line:90%
because of the awareness.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
It's like an inlet into
a tide, into an ocean.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That awareness
produces an exchange.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the exchange,
I can taste what

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
it is that I am in
relationship with,

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:84%
which means, Linda, is that is
I can start wanting to be awake,

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
and then being aware
of myself, and wishing

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.700 align:middle line:84%
to have that relationship
with life instead of the one

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:84%
where I'm always trying
to prove myself in life.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I can start to taste
directly what these thoughts

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.060 align:middle line:90%
and feelings are really doing.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts and feelings either
serve us or they steal from us.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Our problem right now is we
don't know the difference.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.720 align:middle line:84%
Being awake and aware
allows us to start

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:84%
at least discerning
the difference

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:84%
between these energetic states
that are giving us something

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
or that are taking
something away from us.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And this has to be
experienced, but all of us

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:84%
have the features
and the capability

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
to do this kind of
inner self-discovery.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.840 align:middle line:84%
>> In your book, you talk about,
it's an expression, TPICs.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> The Temporary
Person in Charge, TPIC.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Temporary person in charge.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And this temporary
person in charge,

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.440 align:middle line:84%
or it's the temporary
thought in charge?

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's a
way of putting it.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:56.043 align:middle line:84%
This idea of a temporary
person in charge is not new.

00:17:56.043 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
new under the sun.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
The Sufi's, for instance,
call it a commanding self.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.900 align:middle line:84%
But the essence of it is, as
with all teachings have always

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.500 align:middle line:84%
talked about, that we have
within us multiple selves.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.700 align:middle line:84%
We are not a unified being that
is capable of being directed.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:84%
A whole new series of
thoughts just came to me.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:84%
Here we want have a
relationship with God.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.545 align:middle line:84%
Well, which one
of us is it going

00:18:17.545 --> 00:18:19.587 align:middle line:84%
to be in relationship
with, the one who loves him

00:18:19.587 --> 00:18:22.087 align:middle line:84%
or the one who doesn't think
about him because it's thinking

00:18:22.087 --> 00:18:23.530 align:middle line:90%
about money or sex or whatever?

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.330 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
So all of these divided natures
waiting their opportunity

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.600 align:middle line:84%
to get hold of my
mouth and my mind

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.340 align:middle line:84%
until certain circumstances
allow that relationship

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.140 align:middle line:90%
to exist.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of a sudden,
I'm this kind of person.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm out at a party.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:90%
And I'm whatever it is.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day, I am someone

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:84%
who is beating himself up for
being such an exhibitionist.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm at a meeting,
and I'm taking charge.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I don't
want to go to the meeting

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:49.590 align:middle line:84%
because I don't know who I
am, and I'm afraid someone

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
will see I'm stupid.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
All these rotating
personalities,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and every one of them
has my life for as long

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.860 align:middle line:90%
as it's in charge of me.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.850 align:middle line:84%
The answer is not to
dominate one rotating self

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.770 align:middle line:90%
with another rotating self.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.220 align:middle line:84%
It's to see the presence
of these multiple selves,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:84%
these energetic states,
as being what they are,

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:14.880 align:middle line:84%
which is not a self
but something that

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
is lending a certain
energy to me that

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.180 align:middle line:84%
produces a sense of myself
that I'm deriving my life from.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Then from that awareness,
a whole new eye,

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.780 align:middle line:84%
a whole new self starts
to reveal itself.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, this is what
that line is created with.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:84%
This is how God gets
in touch with us

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
is through that part of
us that has laid down

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.170 align:middle line:84%
all the other parts, in
a manner of speaking.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, a lot of
times when people are talking

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.880 align:middle line:84%
today in the area of self-help,
they're saying positive

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
think positively.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.673 align:middle line:84%
And that, eventually, you
will get to that point,

00:19:55.673 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
even if you don't feel that
way that you should just

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:90%
go ahead and think that way.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.560 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it connects with
what I was saying earlier.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
If I wake up in the morning,
and I look in the mirror,

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
and I say, you're so strong.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:90%
You're so strong.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:90%
You're good looking.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.670 align:middle line:90%
You're going to make it.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything's OK.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything is OK.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:84%
Where does that thought
come to me from?

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
What is it that urges
me to say something

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:24.450 align:middle line:84%
like that if not the fear that
I am not those things now.

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
See, that's what I mean by these
secret pair of opposites living

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.360 align:middle line:90%
inside of this intimate enemy.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.480 align:middle line:84%
I think to myself, boy, I'm
really not worth anything.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle line:90%
But I don't catch that thought.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I catch that
thought's extension,

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
which says I better
affirm how good I am.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I affirm how
good I am, and it's

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.910 align:middle line:84%
the secret opposite of the fear
that I'm not good enough, what

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is really being
strengthened other

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.570 align:middle line:84%
than this secret, sad,
self-defeating picture

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.090 align:middle line:84%
I have of myself as
not being good enough?

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:10%
Linda, you and I are
not thought creatures.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
We are creatures that are given
a gift of thought through which

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.640 align:middle line:84%
we can communicate and
extend our understanding

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of the physical
universe that we're in.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
But we are intended to be
human beings that are being.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.940 align:middle line:84%
What man taking thought can
add one cubit to his stature?

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
That means we are not
intended to grow in thought.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.390 align:middle line:84%
We are intended to grow in a
nature by its expanded presence

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.870 align:middle line:84%
allows different qualities of
thoughts to come in and out

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and for us to choose what
serves us and see what doesn't.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a matter of
observing our thoughts,

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:84%
observing our fears, and
just taking a look at them,

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
where it's putting our
attention to them--

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> --whether it
feels good or not.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really that simple.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.870 align:middle line:84%
To become awake, aware
of ourselves-- and see,

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.060 align:middle line:84%
it's popular today that
you shouldn't be afraid.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's like saying you
shouldn't be a human being.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Because the human being
is a very unique creature

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:17.040 align:middle line:84%
upon this Earth that the
higher and lower meet within.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Heaven and hell connect
in a certain place,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
and we can call it
our consciousness.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
So here is all of
this kind of energy,

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
and here's all this
kind of energy.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.080 align:middle line:84%
But we have something in us
that can be awake and aware

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.025 align:middle line:84%
and choose what it serves, what
it is in relationship with.

00:22:32.025 --> 00:22:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And we must understand
the necessity

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
for doing the kind
of spiritual work

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that produces within us, first,
the need to be different,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.400 align:middle line:84%
and, in the awakened need,
the new relationship that need

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.430 align:middle line:84%
produces with what
can help us become

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:90%
different kind of human beings.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And my book is an
interactive book.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And by that I mean it is loaded
with ways in which individuals

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
can take certain ideas,
certain principles,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.772 align:middle line:84%
and see them at
work within them.

00:23:08.772 --> 00:23:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that is a message I
think that we all need to hear.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And we thank you
so much for being

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
with us today and for
sharing your book with us.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I couldn't have
been in a better place.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.
