00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, this is Louise Hay.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.650 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to share
some ideas with you.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:10%
First, please remember that
all teachers are merely

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:10%
stepping stones on
your pathway of growth.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:10%
And this includes me.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I am not a healer, I
do not heal anyone.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I am here to help
you empower yourself

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.940 align:middle line:90%
by sharing ideas with you.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.000 align:middle line:10%
I urge you to read
many books and to study

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:10%
with many teachers, for no
one person or one system

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:10%
can encompass it all.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.890 align:middle line:10%
Life is too vast for us
to totally comprehend.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And life itself is always
growing and expanding

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.484 align:middle line:90%
and becoming more of itself.

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the most powerful
seminar I have ever been

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:90%
to, and I have been to many.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But this is the first
one of this kind, which

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
I think we need more of to
see leadership in women,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.550 align:middle line:84%
and women that can inspire
us, and the spirituality

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:90%
is in there.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> All I can say is I've come
away excited and challenged.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I have some more
information to work on

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to get my life in
a better place.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And my life is in a good
place now compared to what it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.140 align:middle line:90%
was a couple of years ago.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's partially because
of good people and good women

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
finding space to love
and care for one another.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.992 align:middle line:90%


00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:01.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to follow up on
the point you just made about

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.080 align:middle line:84%
the integration of the
holistic approach to medicine

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.280 align:middle line:84%
and the traditional
Western approach.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain a little
bit about your experience

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:90%
with that?

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I can.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Western
medicine is the best emergency

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.050 align:middle line:84%
medical care ever
known on Planet Earth.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And holistic medicine embraces
conventional medicine,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and then adds some of the
ancient wisdom, inner guidance

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:84%
wisdom that people
have always known.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So let's make a
real life scenario.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.610 align:middle line:84%
If you go in and have a
pap smear, what you're

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
having in conventional
Western medicine

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
is cells taken from
the cervix to test

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.830 align:middle line:84%
for pre-cancer or
cancer, and that uses

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:90%
good solid Western techniques.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
However, that is
disease screening--

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.520 align:middle line:84%
it is not creating
health in the cervix,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
it's not preventing
anything in the cervix.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.480 align:middle line:10%
However, if at the same time
that you were doing the pap

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:10%
smear you as the physician or
nurse practitioner were saying

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.620 align:middle line:10%
to the patient, your
cervix looks wonderful,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:10%
then your body is getting
an affirmative message

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:10%
that instantly sends chemicals
associated with hope and joy

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:10%
to the body and actually
helps heal the cervix.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, to take the
holographic thing further,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.760 align:middle line:84%
because we're a hologram
where everything is connected

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.940 align:middle line:84%
to everything else, you
would also say to the woman,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
to keep your cervix
healthy it's very

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:84%
important to get enough
antioxidants in your diet.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend either
a supplement or of course,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.780 align:middle line:84%
the best is fresh fruits
and vegetables every day

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.060 align:middle line:90%
organically grown if possible.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So that at that one visit, you
could be empowering the woman,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.790 align:middle line:84%
doing the best of
conventional Western medicine,

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.360 align:middle line:84%
and also teaching her how
to keep the cervix healthy,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.130 align:middle line:90%
all simultaneously.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:90%
And that is holistic medicine.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's not one or
the other, it's both.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, and so often we're
just giving those negative

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.990 align:middle line:90%
screenings or disease screening.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
Or you're told you don't
have a heart disease yet.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, a lot of Western
medicine, what I was taught

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.700 align:middle line:84%
is, to do disease screening,
but wait for the inevitable,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:90%
you see?

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't have it yet,
come back next year.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.460 align:middle line:90%
So what messages are we sending?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you really want to
do is let people know that they

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.180 align:middle line:84%
have the ability, day to
day, with their thoughts,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.450 align:middle line:84%
with their actions, to create
health and renew their cells

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.565 align:middle line:90%
daily.

00:05:30.565 --> 00:05:34.350 align:middle line:10%
>> I think you mention in
your book too that releasing

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:10%
our emotions and giving
birth to ourselves,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:10%
I thought that was such
a wonderful concept.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Releasing the emotions,
feeling your emotions is

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.600 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
First of all, the emotions
are our soul's guidance system

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:84%
or our inner wisdom's
guidance system.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.542 align:middle line:84%
So if you are incredibly sad,
it's telling you something.

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:57.000 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, whatever
you're doing,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're
thinking is not really

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with true joy.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But you must feel the
sadness and release it

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:90%
through tears or whatever.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.850 align:middle line:90%
You can't push it down.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.080 align:middle line:10%
So often we're taught, don't
feel it, take a stiff drink,

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.200 align:middle line:10%
or keep a stiff upper lip.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> And keep on, keeping on.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
It's what I call the
military metaphor.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And it works if you're
out in the field

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.050 align:middle line:90%
and the enemy is coming.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:84%
You can't let yourself
dissolve in tears.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:10%
But sooner or later, you
must express and release

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.870 align:middle line:10%
your emotions, particularly the
ones we call the negative ones,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.545 align:middle line:10%
of anger and fear and rage.

00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:36.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, we never have those.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:90%
>> We've got it.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.930 align:middle line:84%
We've got to have
those and release them

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:84%
because then they
don't stay in the body

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.365 align:middle line:90%
and affect us adversely.

00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.080 align:middle line:84%
That's the thing I
find so fascinating,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
that the physical
diseases may not

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.255 align:middle line:84%
have to manifest if we can
deal with the emotional.

00:06:51.255 --> 00:06:53.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the main message.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there are
at least 15 studies

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:10%
in the medical
literature that have

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.130 align:middle line:10%
articulated the emotional
patterns associated

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.320 align:middle line:10%
with breast disease.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:10%
Well, now if you
knew those, and you

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:16.020 align:middle line:10%
were able to work with
transforming those, then to me

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:10%
that, plus eating
your vegetables--

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Is the best prevention for
breast disease that I know of.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's the important and
exciting part of the holistic

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:10%
paradigm.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.575 align:middle line:10%
It's not just wait
for the inevitable.

00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:29.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Right,

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Accidents are associated with
rage and anger and depression.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:84%
That's well known in
the medical literature.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Accidents don't
just happen, they're

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
almost attracted to people who
are in certain mental states.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you knew that,
you could pull over

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
to the side of the road, calm
down, do a little meditation,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.725 align:middle line:84%
call somebody,
don't keep driving.

00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.413 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned too about
feeling those emotions, having

00:07:58.413 --> 00:07:59.705 align:middle line:90%
a breakdown, do a breakthrough.

00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And that means
sometimes for people,

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
especially if they
have been brought up

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:13.010 align:middle line:84%
in families or environments that
reward emotional calmness all

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.360 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
We must all never let
them see you sweat.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's how we say
it in this culture.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes then
you'll have an event

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.370 align:middle line:84%
hit you in which
you'll start to cry.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:10%
And if you allow yourself
to go with those tears,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:10%
to go with those feelings,
to stay with them

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:10%
for 10 minutes, 15
minutes, an hour,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.309 align:middle line:10%
you will often find
yourself weeping

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:41.299 align:middle line:10%
tears that needed to be shed
when you were five years old.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And you will actually
cleanse your entire body.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.880 align:middle line:84%
You look younger
when you've finished

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:90%
one of those situations.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.140 align:middle line:84%
But we're a little
terrified of that kind

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.203 align:middle line:84%
of emotional expression
in Western culture.

00:08:54.203 --> 00:08:55.245 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's changing.

00:08:55.245 --> 00:08:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It is changing.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, we're not the
sensitivity and all that.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't mean do
this in the middle of work.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.545 align:middle line:84%
You do it when you
have a good time

00:09:03.545 --> 00:09:05.795 align:middle line:84%
and you feel safe and
protected, and it's appropriate.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.200 align:middle line:84%
One thing I wanted
to ask you also

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.480 align:middle line:84%
is, this really expands far
beyond our physical bodies,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.055 align:middle line:84%
even in terms of
our life's purpose.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:16.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:18.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And being on
purpose in our lives,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.803 align:middle line:90%
and how that affects our health?

00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you see I believe
that each of us has a purpose,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.240 align:middle line:84%
a life's purpose, a plan
that we're here to fulfill.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.480 align:middle line:10%
Now I don't think that's
preordained from someone

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.650 align:middle line:10%
outside of yourself.

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:10%
You know that plan.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.910 align:middle line:10%
When you're doing
the things you love

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:40.250 align:middle line:10%
to do, then your emotional
body, your mental body,

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:10%
your physical body, your
hormones, your immune system,

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.248 align:middle line:10%
your endocrine system
all work at their best.

00:09:47.248 --> 00:09:48.540 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's the message.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And now I have
talked to educators.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:10%
And one woman in particular
started a school,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.370 align:middle line:10%
and she said, it has taken me
20 years to really believe this,

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.910 align:middle line:10%
but if you take children and
allow them to follow what

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:10%
they're naturally
attracted to, they

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.580 align:middle line:10%
will, in fact, go right for
what they are meant to do,

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:10%
what brings them the most joy,
and what they are best at.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.395 align:middle line:84%
They do not need
to be controlled.

00:10:12.395 --> 00:10:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
I know you mentioned some
examples in your books

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.640 align:middle line:84%
about people who have
switched careers or gotten out

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:84%
of relationships and
followed that inner guidance,

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:84%
and the physical symptoms
are the diseases.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:25.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Go away.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.630 align:middle line:10%
I had one patient in
particular whose mother

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.320 align:middle line:10%
had died of breast cancer.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And she realized that she
was exactly the same age

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.470 align:middle line:90%
that her mother had been.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:10%
And she was in a job she did
not like, and in a location

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.420 align:middle line:10%
she didn't like.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.590 align:middle line:10%
And she changed everything and
realized that, in so doing,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.910 align:middle line:10%
she changed the
script in her cells.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.210 align:middle line:10%
And I think we need to look
at family history of disease.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
People see that as
a sentence, and it's

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:90%
really more like a script.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:10%
You can play it
any way you want,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:10%
but it isn't a sentence
that a judge gives to you.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
When I have a woman
who says, well,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
every woman in my family had
a hysterectomy before the age

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
of 40, I'll look at the
family history and say,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
what about Sally
here, she didn't.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And oh, she's not
like the rest of us.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:16.910 align:middle line:90%
She's a black sheep.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:23.330 align:middle line:10%
So again, our biology, no matter
what we inherited in our genes,

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:10%
is determined by
our belief system

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.630 align:middle line:10%
and how we live our lives.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:90%
It is not predetermined.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.570 align:middle line:84%
We have an incorrect
non-scientific belief system

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:84%
going on in society
now about genetics.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Identical twins
are not identical.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:10%
They have identical DNA.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:10%
They do not have identical
diseases or potentials at all.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't,
certainly if you

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.042 align:middle line:84%
have a family history of
breast cancer or heart disease,

00:11:53.042 --> 00:11:54.875 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to follow
that script either.

00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And so many of those
statistics get ingrained

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.010 align:middle line:90%
in us-- one in nine.

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they do.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially with
family histories.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:84%
I know in your work with Women
to Women, your center in Maine,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.850 align:middle line:90%
you do an extensive form.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:90%
And I was reading that.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.600 align:middle line:10%
It's not just the
family, it's how

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:10%
do you feel when
this is going on,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.730 align:middle line:10%
and lifestyle
things, and emotions.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:15.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when a
patient feels that out,

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:90%
there's a lot of ding.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Aha.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Little bells go off
because she realizes, oh yeah.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And taking the time to
really look at your life,

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
to write in a journal, to
fill out a questionnaire,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.190 align:middle line:84%
to do the Myers-Briggs,
whatever it is,

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:39.320 align:middle line:84%
taking the time to have
introspective relationship

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.495 align:middle line:90%
with yourself in that way.

00:12:40.495 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Quiet the mind.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Quiet begins to
change the pattern.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the exciting part.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to wait
around, you can do it today.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Or if tonight
you're feeling low,

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I
do when I get my mind,

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.830 align:middle line:84%
I call it gerbil
wheel in the brain--

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
goes around and around and
around in a negative pattern.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes just going
to a funny movie is all

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:04.045 align:middle line:84%
that's needed to
get me out of that.

00:13:04.045 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And it doesn't
really take a long time.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not as if we have to set
aside half a day or a weekend.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Just a break, just
whatever works for us.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do it in a minute.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:10%
You can do it through
breathing fully

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:10%
through your nose,
which gives you

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.020 align:middle line:10%
an automatic physiologic
breath where you aerate

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.618 align:middle line:10%
the bottoms of your lungs.

00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:24.160 align:middle line:10%
Just breathing in through your
nose and out through your nose

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.870 align:middle line:10%
three times will
change the brainwaves

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.145 align:middle line:10%
and change the immunity.

00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:32.620 align:middle line:84%
>> See, I think that's
something we don't always get.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.347 align:middle line:84%
We think it needs to be a
massive effort, and set aside.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:84%
>> That's how we're
trained in this culture.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
We're trained in an
emergency mentality.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Just watch "ER."

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the show is fabulous
because it's so accurate.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:10%
And what that show
does that I really love

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.330 align:middle line:10%
is it shows you that all the
medicine in the world, all

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.090 align:middle line:10%
of the surgical
skill in the world

00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:10%
does not impact the lives
of those people that

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.470 align:middle line:10%
lead up to that emergency,
that it can't that.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:05.770 align:middle line:84%
I remember in your
book you said you never

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:84%
felt comfortable saying the
gallbladder in trauma 3,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it might be.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.950 align:middle line:84%
That's a person,
that's a whole set of--

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a whole
volume of knowledge.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Every time a person
comes in, it's

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:10%
a whole volume of knowledge.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.670 align:middle line:84%
We're taught to take
our bodies to doctors

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:90%
when there's a problem.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think some
of that is good.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.270 align:middle line:10%
A lot of that though
is an overstatement.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.150 align:middle line:10%
With managed care and so on,
now the average doctor spending

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:10%
10, 15 minutes with a patient.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.510 align:middle line:10%
You know yourself so much
better than any professional can

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.350 align:middle line:10%
know you in 15 minutes.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.560 align:middle line:10%
So if you take the
time to know yourself,

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:10%
if you take the
time to know what

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.930 align:middle line:10%
you can do to change
your body, then you

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.100 align:middle line:10%
can use medical care
very selectively.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.103 align:middle line:84%
You can keep your
bills way down.

00:14:53.103 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's Encouraging.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:10%
Do you have any tips
for us on creating

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:10%
that doctor-patient
relationship and going

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:10%
in as an advocate
of our own bodies

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:10%
and having the medical
practitioner respect that?

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, first of all, it's very
helpful to find a physician

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:14.230 align:middle line:84%
who's philosophically
aligned with you.

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.270 align:middle line:84%
So you can call
beforehand and say,

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.680 align:middle line:84%
look, I'm a big believer
in natural medicine,

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:90%
whenever possible.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:10%
And then you just
say to the staff,

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.290 align:middle line:10%
is this doctor
interested in that.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:27.970 align:middle line:10%
Now I'll tell you
a biggie, and that

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.100 align:middle line:10%
is if the doctor or
the nurse practitioner

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:36.430 align:middle line:10%
or whoever practices this
in his or her own life--

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:10%
that's going to be
your biggest tip.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Or they had a
personal experience

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:84%
with a family member or
a near-death experience

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:45.820 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.580 align:middle line:10%
The American Holistic
Medical Association

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:10%
keeps a directory of physicians.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
Another good way, frankly,
is to go into a health food

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.700 align:middle line:84%
store in your area and ask who
the simpatico practitioners are

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:90%
in your area.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.708 align:middle line:90%
And you'll find out that way.

00:16:00.708 --> 00:16:02.770 align:middle line:90%
Word of mouth is the best.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:10%
I maintain a referral list
for my newsletter subscribers

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:10%
when I go around the country
and I meet a simpatico doctor,

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:12.310 align:middle line:10%
I always say, give me your
card, I want your name.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Now I want to know
who's doing the work,

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:90%
because I agree with you.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.750 align:middle line:10%
It's one thing to follow these
principles in your own life.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:10%
It's quite another
and wonderful thing

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.620 align:middle line:10%
to have a partnership
with a practitioner who

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.590 align:middle line:10%
understands good solid
medicine and also

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:10%
knows how to add these other
things, and who can say to you,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.590 align:middle line:10%
OK, I'll do this part, I
was trained in this part.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to add
this stuff to your diet,

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.065 align:middle line:84%
keep breathing, do
exercise, and so on,

00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have this
partnership relationship.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.513 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that is so vital.

00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And I know for our
audience that's

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:52.427 align:middle line:84%
going to be so helpful in
just creating our own health.

00:16:52.427 --> 00:16:54.010 align:middle line:84%
Just switching gears
a little bit too.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
I found something interesting
in your book about our life's

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
energy and our attitudes toward
money and just that whole thing

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.375 align:middle line:84%
and how it can affect
our emotions and being.

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little?

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, here's the thing.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.457 align:middle line:10%
If people were to define
the word money, what

00:17:12.457 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:10%
we learned from the
time we were little kids

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:10%
is there's not enough.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.079 align:middle line:84%
So it creates this feeling
that there can never be enough.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:10%
And even in people who
have a whole lot of money,

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:10%
there's still a feeling
often that it's not enough.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.670 align:middle line:10%
We need to think in terms
of the term abundance.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:10%
And what I have found
with many patients

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:10%
and with myself is the more
I'm focused on abundance

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:10%
in my life, what's working,
the amount of time I have,

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:10%
what I love, the
friends and so on,

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:10%
and as my self-worth improves,
then my income improves.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.142 align:middle line:10%
And this has happened
for hundreds of people.

00:17:53.142 --> 00:17:54.600 align:middle line:10%
There's a wonderful
book out called

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.240 align:middle line:10%
"Your Money Or Your Life," by
Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And what they have done is
create a formula whereby you

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:10%
assign a dollar amount to each
hour of your life's energy

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.570 align:middle line:10%
after determining how many
more hours you have to live

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.110 align:middle line:10%
in your life.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And once you have
made a dollar amount,

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
then you begin to realize that
your life energy is the most

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.080 align:middle line:90%
important thing you have.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:10%
And when you follow their
program, it's only one

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.050 align:middle line:10%
of many, what happens
is people's expenses

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:29.550 align:middle line:10%
tend to decrease by 30%.

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Is that right?

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Within a month or two, yes.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Because they begin to focus
on what's really important.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.710 align:middle line:10%
Now you don't need to live
so frugally that you're

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:10%
counting every penny.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.970 align:middle line:10%
>> But what you need to do
when you are going to work,

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.560 align:middle line:10%
you need to say, if I
had six months to live,

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.350 align:middle line:10%
would I stay in this job.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
I was recently in
Idaho and there

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:84%
was a bus driver who just
won the Idaho State Lottery,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.040 align:middle line:90%
won a lot of money.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.990 align:middle line:90%
And what he said--

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
I was told this by
the staff-- was,

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
this is the best job
I ever had in my life,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:90%
there is no way I'm stopping.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>> If you--

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a connection
there with his--

00:19:12.175 --> 00:19:12.975 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:19:12.975 --> 00:19:13.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Prosperity.

00:19:13.775 --> 00:19:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that he opened up
the channels to prosperity

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.940 align:middle line:84%
in winning the lottery just
because he already felt that

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:90%
abundance.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's what we
need to feel every day.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's focusing
on what's working

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:10%
and what we do mostly
in this culture

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.260 align:middle line:10%
is we spend a great deal of
time on what's not working.

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to the
news every night,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.990 align:middle line:84%
it's as though they have
scouts out all over the planet.

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And they have to bring in all
the bad news for the planet

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.830 align:middle line:90%
to your living room every night.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.580 align:middle line:10%
And if there is none
in your neighborhood,

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.430 align:middle line:10%
you've got to go across
the seas to find it.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.220 align:middle line:10%
Physiologically, we're
not set up for that.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.100 align:middle line:10%
So one of my
creating health tips

00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.450 align:middle line:10%
is be very careful about
what you let into your living

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:10%
room on television.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.540 align:middle line:10%
And that certainly includes
the media, the news.

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:04.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Particularly the news.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us in closing
here a little bit about

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:84%
your Women to Women Clinic in
New England and how we can--

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Women to Women is a
center in Yarmouth, Maine,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:84%
where women come from
all over the world.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
It's about to open
a center in Israel.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
We're also working on a
concept called the Meta

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
Resorts in Anguilla
where people can

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.420 align:middle line:84%
go to get a complete
creating health profile.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:10%
In other words, go
to a beautiful space

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:10%
and get blood work
and tests and so on,

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:42.300 align:middle line:10%
but the ones that will help
them start now to create health.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So that's the Women to Women
Center and outreach programs.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Then I have a newsletter called
"Health Wisdom for Women"

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:84%
published by Philips
Publishing International.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a monthly newsletter.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.290 align:middle line:84%
It's actionable
information you can

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:84%
use right now to make your
life healthier regardless

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:90%
of your starting point.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.270 align:middle line:10%
And then I've got I wrote the
book, "Women's Bodies, Women's

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:10%
Wisdom," which I'm currently
in the middle of revising.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> It's wonderful.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, we'll give our
viewers and our audience

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.970 align:middle line:84%
here information on how to
get more information from you

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.768 align:middle line:84%
and on the subject and
numbers to call and such.

00:21:15.768 --> 00:21:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Are there any other
points you'd like

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:21.120 align:middle line:84%
to make while we're here
just on your whole area,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:90%
your whole sphere of work?

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, right now I'm currently
writing another book on mothers

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
and daughters because I can't
think of a better way for women

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.150 align:middle line:84%
to promote health than to
start with their own bodies,

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:35.800 align:middle line:84%
their own babies,
their own daughters.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And I think what we
teach to our daughters

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:42.630 align:middle line:84%
becomes their
emotional inheritance,

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.810 align:middle line:84%
that which is passed down
through the maternal line.

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And that sets the stage
for health or illness.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
women are the ones

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.640 align:middle line:84%
who make most of the
doctor's appointments,

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
go to 75% of
doctor's visits, are

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
the ones making the health care
decisions for their families.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman gets
healthy, her whole family

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.520 align:middle line:84%
gets healthy usually,
and I think ultimately

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.990 align:middle line:90%
her whole community.

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:90%
And even the planet benefits.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:09.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:84%
And your opinion too is
that our culture and society

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.673 align:middle line:84%
is starting to accept more
of the alternative healing,

00:22:15.673 --> 00:22:18.090 align:middle line:84%
the holistic approach, integrate
it with Western medicine.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.880 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I go, doctors are
more and more interested in.
