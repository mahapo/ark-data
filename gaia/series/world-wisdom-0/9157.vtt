00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And welcome to
"A World of Wisdom."

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you have ever wondered
if a little more money,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
or a whole lot of money, or
a new partner, or a partner,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
would help make
your life complete,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:84%
working from the inside out or
working from the outside in,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.140 align:middle line:84%
then you are going to
love my guest today.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:90%
She is an entrepreneur.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:90%
She's a graphic designer.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:84%
She is a transformational
educator.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:10%
And she has written the
book, "All I Ever wanted

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:10%
Was a Lot of Money
and a Husband,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:10%
And Instead I Got
Enlightenment."

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:84%
It gives me a pleasure
to welcome you,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Catherine, Catherine
Lenard, to our show.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.252 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being with us.

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:05.127 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you Carolyn.

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> You have had a journey.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And your book is filled with a
lot of different relationships,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.990 align:middle line:84%
a lot of risk taking,
where you have left jobs.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I think you worked with
Playboy as a graphic designer

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.520 align:middle line:90%
early on in your career.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And you took a courageous
move to take a step.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And in looking back and
writing your journey,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.600 align:middle line:84%
there have been tremendous
lessons along the way

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.070 align:middle line:90%
that you have learned.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Has it been from the risk
taking, or really trying

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:84%
to go for that guy
with all the money?

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Initially, it was from
trying to get the right man

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and to have a lot of money.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, initially
that's what the whole gist

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:90%
of my existence was.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.300 align:middle line:10%
I was very focused on trying to
create these things in my life.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:10%
And it absolutely
wasn't happening.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:10%
And as things
moved along, then I

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:10%
began to see that
perhaps maybe it

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.820 align:middle line:10%
had something to do with what
was going on with inside of me.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.947 align:middle line:84%
>> But you didn't
get that overnight,

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:06.780 align:middle line:84%
that perhaps it has
something to do with me.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:84%
What were some of the things
that you saw along the way?

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.509 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my gosh.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.470 align:middle line:84%
No, this is over years and
years of personal growth.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it was motivated
by tremendous discomfort

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
within my own skin and not being
able to create what I wanted.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't even aware that
I did have any power

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:84%
to create what I did or
didn't want at that point.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And primarily, it was
a journey of trying

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
to become comfortable within
myself in any way that I could,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle line:84%
whether it was therapy
or group therapy or books

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
or introspection
or anything that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.690 align:middle line:84%
had to do with personal
growth or spirituality.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was along those
lines that I finally

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.350 align:middle line:84%
began to understand that going
within was a key to that.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Catherine, you know that the
know the salaries that are paid

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
to women versus men are still
lower for the same position,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.410 align:middle line:84%
as research is showing
this right now.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:90%
And many of us--

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
I know when I was growing
up, the idea even of college

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
and my going to college in my
household was not a necessity,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:84%
that I really was to, it was
sort of an understatement.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't stated overtly, but
that we had to, as women, find

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.660 align:middle line:90%
someone to take care of us.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds
really primitive.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But could that still be in
some of our genetic makeup

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.770 align:middle line:84%
that that is important to find
someone else to take care of,

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:90%
whether it's a man or a woman.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm hoping that it isn't
in the genetic makeup.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I would choose to
not use that belief.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
But I do believe that it
is still prevalent as much

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.420 align:middle line:84%
as when women are
independent, I talk

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of different people
where the idea is, again,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.380 align:middle line:84%
to get married and have the
husband take care of them.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.817 align:middle line:84%
So I found that sort of
surprising in this day and age.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.650 align:middle line:84%
But yes, I do believe
that it's still there.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we reconcile that
with the idea that children need

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
our nurturing and our
taking care of them?

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And yet we want
to have a career,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:84%
and not that finding that
perfect relationship is

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.990 align:middle line:84%
the total answer, but
it seems like we almost

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.380 align:middle line:84%
have to lean in that direction,
that for several years

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have children,
I need to stay home,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
and I need somebody
to take care of me.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't particularly
follow that line of thinking.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I really-- in fact, I get
away from gender specific.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Because what's
happened is I've begun

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.920 align:middle line:84%
to look at people as individuals
and as powerful creators

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:90%
in their own right.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And so those kinds of models,
yes, they're out there.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's something that I
don't put a lot of attention

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:90%
and energy on.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I think more of
personal development

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.240 align:middle line:90%
and what flows from that.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We come from all different
areas of being told when we

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.630 align:middle line:84%
were very young that we've
got it all in ourself,

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.650 align:middle line:90%
we can make it happen.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
But for many of us,
we weren't told that.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
Our belief system was that
we needed to find someone

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.700 align:middle line:90%
to take care of us.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.250 align:middle line:84%
We needed to find someone that
could make a lot of money,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and that it was
outside of ourself.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Where did the
shift come for you?

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The shift came for me as
I went within more and more

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.710 align:middle line:84%
and began to understand that
I had a true hand in creating

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:90%
my outside world.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
is I began to change

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:84%
my beliefs about money and about
needing to be taken care of.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you change them?

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>> The way I began to change
my beliefs is number one,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.490 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of
what I was thinking.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.730 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was
over a course of time.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And now it's become rather
innate, so to speak.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is, again,
become aware of thinking.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
If I'm thinking that I need
someone to take care of me,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly the
experience that I'm

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.970 align:middle line:90%
going to draw to myself.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if I acknowledge myself
as a powerful creator who's

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.060 align:middle line:84%
able to change
those beliefs, I can

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
begin to manifest that
in my outer world.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a study done
years ago, Harvard did this.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And it showed that those people
that went to Ivy League schools

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.190 align:middle line:84%
grew up in families where
the belief was never,

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.550 align:middle line:84%
ever anything other than they
would go to Ivy League schools.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So it seems like you're
saying the same thing.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that we're all
indoctrinated in different

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:90%
ways.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:84%
But the beautiful thing
about indoctrination

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.440 align:middle line:84%
is that when you become aware
of what you're believing,

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.750 align:middle line:84%
you can change those
beliefs and create anything

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
you want, even if you
didn't have the benefit of,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
yes, I will have this in my life
as a normal course of affairs.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a critical point
where we learn that we are

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
believing one thing and
wanting something else?

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.920 align:middle line:90%
How do we recognize that?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Believing one thing and
wanting something else.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell
you, for the longest

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
time I wanted desperately
to find the right person.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
until I began to go

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.420 align:middle line:84%
within that I
began to understand

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.650 align:middle line:84%
that I had a belief that
attachments create pain.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So although I wanted these
things in my life so much,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.780 align:middle line:84%
I was attracting
relationships that

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:84%
were painful, very difficult,
or no relationship at all.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Because again, this was
all under the umbrella

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:90%
of attachments create pain.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.910 align:middle line:90%
So my world was reflecting that.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The attachment to, I think
we were talking earlier,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
the attachment word
for you meant--

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
you're referring to that as
far as it's a connection,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.150 align:middle line:84%
that connection with
someone else, especially

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
a significant other,
creates pain, or pain

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.040 align:middle line:90%
goes along with it.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Or any kind of
closeness with people.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:90%
It was a fearful thing.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.300 align:middle line:90%
It was dangerous.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:90%
It hurt to be close to people.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you know that you
were carrying that belief?

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It was through a process.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was through just becoming
aware of what I was thinking.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
And also becoming aware of what
my life was presenting to me.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There are-- you
talk about this.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.270 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you use
this term specifically.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I related to it as far as
the chemicalization, that

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
when a new belief or a truth
belief, belief of a truth,

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
hits an old belief, that there's
something that physiologically

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.840 align:middle line:90%
is taking place, isn't there?

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I know the word
chemicalization.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
But I would also
like to say that I

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:84%
hit a great deal
of resistance when

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I began to see what
I was believing

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to bring
in a new belief.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:84%
There was huge
resistance, whether I'd

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.059 align:middle line:84%
want to go to sleep, or just
didn't want to go there,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.530 align:middle line:84%
didn't want to deal
with it at all.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.634 align:middle line:84%
It's, again, because that new
belief is becoming infused,

00:08:39.634 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and the old doesn't want to
give up the ghost, so to speak.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
resistance to that.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Some of the--

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of some of the
ways that we can understand this

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.540 align:middle line:90%
more deeply and more personally.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:84%
What would be a belief where
we're standing in the moment

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and we finally get it that
our situation is horrible,

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.560 align:middle line:84%
either at work, in our
finances, in our family,

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.750 align:middle line:84%
in our relationships
or something,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.000 align:middle line:84%
what could we be
holding on to and what

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
would be a new
belief that we really

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.080 align:middle line:84%
want to gravitate
to and incorporate?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be
whatever you choose.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.345 align:middle line:84%
You know, once you
become aware, you

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
have that choice to either
stay in the present with where

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.580 align:middle line:90%
you are or create a new one.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.520 align:middle line:84%
Say, if your finances are
in miserable condition,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
you know, I really love
the belief about abundance

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:90%
and it's an unlimited universe.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And boy, I sure didn't have
that one for a long time.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
It took a lot of awareness and
a lot of trials and tribulations

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.630 align:middle line:84%
to get to that point
and to be able to see

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.430 align:middle line:90%
that I had beliefs about lack.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I was creating
a lot of roller coaster

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.100 align:middle line:84%
income in my life or
no income, or just

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.230 align:middle line:84%
this whole consciousness
that there isn't enough

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:90%
or there's only just so much.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:90%
And I needed to hang on to it.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So when I began
to change and say,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think I'd prefer to
have a belief about abundance

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and that all these wonderful
things can come to me,

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.750 align:middle line:90%
my reality began to change.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it's true.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I know in my own life
with a relationship,

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.447 align:middle line:84%
I continued to want
to change this man.

00:10:07.447 --> 00:10:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that I
was trying to change him.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I was just critical of
what he did, how he did it.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And I thought if he would
just do it differently,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:84%
it would be different,
we would be different.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was told to look
at this man and say,

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I accept you exactly as you are.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And as Pollyanna as that sounded
to me, it took more courage,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:84%
more strength within a
24-hour period to continue--

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:90%
it became a mantra--

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:90%
to continue saying that.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:84%
But the chemicalization,
or the shift,

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.952 align:middle line:90%
really took a lot of effort.

00:10:45.952 --> 00:10:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It was, like I was saying,
get thee behind me, Satan,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
But it took that in order
to shift what I had always

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
believed, and the new
belief that I wanted to--

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.270 align:middle line:84%
is that the kind of thing
you're talking about?

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what's coming
to mind right now--

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to add this-- is
that in our relationships,

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
if someone is really
pushing your buttons,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.590 align:middle line:84%
something that they're doing
is affecting you adversely,

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
know that that is something
within you that needs

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.590 align:middle line:90%
to be addressed or healed.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it really has very
little to do with them.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:21.010 align:middle line:84%
They're serving as a
mirror for you and for us.

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And what a beautiful
gift that is.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:84%
To begin to ask ourself if
I'm not feeling this person

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
is being a certain way,
intimate, joyful, or whatever,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:84%
to turn that back around
and say, well, where

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:90%
am I not expressing intimacy?

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Where am I not?

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.947 align:middle line:84%
And it isn't Pollyanna, it
really, it's magic, isn't it?

00:11:40.947 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It absolutely is.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
>> The universal law
really works for us.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:90%
You have also been introduced--

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.280 align:middle line:84%
I think it was David that
introduced you to experiencing

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
the celestial tones.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And that was quite eye
opening, body opening,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.260 align:middle line:90%
heart opening for you.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It was one of the most
magnificent experiences

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.020 align:middle line:90%
in my life to that point.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.350 align:middle line:84%
It was being in a state of
absolute unconditional love

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.100 align:middle line:90%
for another person.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And I found that having a
very open heart allowed realms

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
that are normally not accessible
to be accessed and experienced.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:90%
It was tremendous.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:22.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Beyond the third
dimension then.

00:12:22.868 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to pause a
moment and hear from some

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:90%
of our supporters.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.405 align:middle line:84%
And when we come
back, I'd like for you

00:12:28.405 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
to share a little bit more
about that with our viewers,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:90%
if you would, please.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.690 align:middle line:84%
You are watching "A
World of Wisdom."

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft, speaking
with Catherine Lenard.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.703 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:12:40.703 --> 00:12:43.421 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm Carolyn Craft, speaking
with Catherine Lenard.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:84%
She is author of the
book "All I Ever Wanted

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Was a Lot of Money
and A Husband,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and Instead I Did
Get Enlightenment."

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.407 align:middle line:10%
I think we all go after that
at some point in our life,

00:12:58.407 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:10%
that there's something
outside of ourselves that's

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.207 align:middle line:10%
going to help us have
the happiness and success

00:13:03.207 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:10%
that we really want.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're really
understanding and learning

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.520 align:middle line:90%
that it is an inside job.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:10%
You had an experience with
a relationship, David,

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:10%
where he introduced you
to the celestial tones.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And you said it was a
beautiful experience.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea of what
that was like for you.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, Carolyn, it was
absolutely awesome.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.740 align:middle line:10%
You know, again, it was being--

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.280 align:middle line:10%
we were under extreme
circumstances.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:10%
There were some physical things
that were going on with him.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And I just felt incredible
unconditional love

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:90%
for this person.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And he, having the ability
to see into other dimensions

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:46.450 align:middle line:84%
was able to call my attention
to interdimensional beings that

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:90%
began to fill the room.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain
point, I saw light

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.940 align:middle line:84%
streams that were
coming down toward him.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And I saw an actual
grid formation

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.690 align:middle line:90%
that was around my body.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:90%
Some might know it as a merkaba.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know exactly
how to term it.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I would just prefer to
say that it was beautiful,

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
with tetrahedrons
spinning in it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling was just of
amazingly incredible love.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And actually heard
celestial tones,

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.470 align:middle line:84%
which was, I don't know how
to explain that exactly, it's

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.800 align:middle line:90%
just I've come to recognize it.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Music not of this world.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Oh, subtle vision,
subtle hearing,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.120 align:middle line:84%
something not seen or heard
with the regular five senses.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a privilege
and such an honor.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.900 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me the
knowledge, bar none,

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
that there's so much more than
this third dimensional reality

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're all
walking around in.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What, for you, what
was the purpose, the gift,

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.200 align:middle line:90%
in that experience?

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.780 align:middle line:90%
How did that change your life?

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I began to understand
that the more that I could open

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.410 align:middle line:84%
my heart by being vulnerable
and honest in my day-to-day

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
dealings with people, that
would allow the heart to open,

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.020 align:middle line:90%
let the defenses come down.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And through that open heart,
all kinds of magical things

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
open to us that
aren't really there

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:84%
for walking around,
like defensive and upset

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and just keeping
people at a distance.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
So the more that I found
that I open my heart,

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:90%
the more that became accessible.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.320 align:middle line:84%
>> When you open your heart and
you feel that vulnerability,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.735 align:middle line:84%
how do you balance the
things that come up from that

00:15:30.735 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
openhearted space, where
you're out there where you

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.700 align:middle line:90%
haven't been before?

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're in a
relationship with someone,

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.140 align:middle line:84%
a business
relationship, and you're

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.960 align:middle line:90%
really vulnerable with them.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And the heart is just wide
open and you feel such love.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a
comment or a voice inside

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.390 align:middle line:84%
that says, this isn't
safe, it's got to be--

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
you've got to do
something different.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.350 align:middle line:90%
How do you handle that?

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.780 align:middle line:84%
>> I find that from the
space of the open heart,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't get that so much.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
It just feels so good to
be touching heart to heart

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
on a real true, intimate
basis with someone,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.410 align:middle line:90%
just sharing that moment.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It's so beautiful that
those thoughts don't even

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.257 align:middle line:90%
enter my mind.

00:16:10.257 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You've got the ball with you.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Because you use that as a
demonstration in your work.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:90%
I love using this ball.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
demonstrates beliefs,

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
as we were talking
about earlier.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
And I use it as an
illustration for self.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:84%
If I think of myself as my name,
my job, my friends and family,

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
the people that I
love, everything

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that comprises my
personal universe

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:90%
is contained within this ball.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:84%
What happens is, this
contains all the beliefs.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it's what I'm walking
around with day to day.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And I find that if I can
step outside of my universe

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:84%
and began to watch
what I'm thinking,

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.060 align:middle line:84%
watching those thoughts,
the thoughts create beliefs.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.310 align:middle line:84%
I can choose to
change those thoughts,

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.650 align:middle line:90%
and therefore change my reality.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to want to have
a life that is pain-free.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:06.460 align:middle line:84%
And the great avatars and
gurus and sages of the ages

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:12.640 align:middle line:84%
suggest that there is a
burning, that gold is refined

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.438 align:middle line:90%
when there's a burning off.

00:17:14.438 --> 00:17:15.730 align:middle line:90%
I don't know if that's correct.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But that we do walk
through a fire at times,

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.359 align:middle line:90%
and that fire is painful.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:84%
So do you see a place
for pain in our life?

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It served me greatly
in my past experiences.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, being absolutely
seared to the core.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:84%
Because that levels the
playing field and then

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I was able to go from there to
entirely different experiences.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
But that old truly
needed to be burned away.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Now it's not to say that I don't
have painful experiences now.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Because certainly, there's
always more to work on.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.212 align:middle line:84%
But the valleys aren't as
deep as they were before.

00:17:50.212 --> 00:17:51.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's just not
quite as devastating.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:90%
>> --more gentle.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:52.730 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.190 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be a painful
experience now in a more subtle

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:90%
way for you, Catherine?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think to be away from
love would be very painful.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And I speak in a
more universal way,

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
to go back to living
very defensively

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:90%
and being very closed.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And that sort of re-emphasizes
that cosmic separation

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:90%
that's within all of us.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
But that, to me,
is very painful.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Then how do you feel safe?

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
What do you do to support
yourself in experiencing safety

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:90%
in the world?

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends what's going
on on a particular day

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
at a particular
moment, quite honestly.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes I
just want to cocoon

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and I find the safe
place in my home

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.880 align:middle line:84%
and just do whatever I can to be
very kind and loving to myself.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:90%
That creates safety.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:90%
Again, it just depends.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> When you wrote the
book, what was your intent?

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And is that the same intent now
in sharing it with the world?

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The intent is absolutely
to be of service.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And that intention has
expanded and grown.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's my absolute
delight and joy

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.900 align:middle line:84%
to be out talking with people
and sharing what I've learned.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So your experiences,
you're pretty much,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
you've gone pretty
naked, then, haven't you?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, in
writing this book,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I really debated about whether
I wanted to be that emotionally

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.690 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable,
spiritually vulnerable.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Did I want to, number one,
be that way toward myself,

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and number two, share that with
those that would read my book?

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.830 align:middle line:84%
But what I found is that if I
can be very honest about what's

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:84%
going on in my own
experiences, it

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.070 align:middle line:84%
creates a safe space for others
to become honest about what's

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.480 align:middle line:90%
going on in their lives.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And through that honesty,
we all find freedom.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we are continually
being asked by the universe,

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
by God, the God of
our understanding,

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
to come back to the moment and
be so present in this moment.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something that
we could go to the university

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and come out four years later
and know how to do this.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You do work with people and
help them understand about time

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:90%
and their own rhythms.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.052 align:middle line:84%
What can you share with
us today about that?

00:20:08.052 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:84%
>> That there are rhythms
in each of our lives.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.190 align:middle line:84%
There are seasons
in each of our lives

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:84%
There is time to
be very proactive

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and create goals and intentions,
and there's other times just

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:84%
go with the flow and be
open to listening to what

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.750 align:middle line:90%
the universe has for us.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you
think is the, I guess,

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:84%
the greatest craving or yearning
from humanity and all the work

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.020 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing?

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:84%
What are you seeing is our
greatest need, our greatest

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:90%
desire?

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Oneness with the creator,
oneness with spirit,

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:90%
the healing.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
We all have this idea of being
unworthy and being separate.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And to not only feel
that and acknowledge it,

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:90%
but then to let it go.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Because in looking for money, a
husband, or anything external,

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of like a cheap fix
for what this real issue is

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
about, which is
experiencing, again, the

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:10.040 align:middle line:90%
oneness that we all once knew.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been a pleasure
having you with us on "A World

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:13.380 align:middle line:90%
of Wisdom."

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much,
Catherine Lenard.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to keep up
with you and your activities

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:90%
and what you're about.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And your book, " All I Ever
Wanted Was a Lot of Money

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and a Husband" Instead
I Got Enlightenment."

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.380 align:middle line:84%
I will say to our viewers,
it is short, easy to read,

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
quick, and quite a roller
coaster exciting ride

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
being with us today.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Sue.
