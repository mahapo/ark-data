00:00:03.984 --> 00:01:06.732 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, and welcome to
the "World of Wisdom."

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
My name is Linda
Rachel, and I'll

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:84%
be your host for
the next 30 minutes.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Today we have as our special
guest author Guy Finley.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:84%
He has just written
a wonderful book

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and shared his insights
in the area of self-help

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.230 align:middle line:90%
and self-discovery.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
The book is called
"The Intimate Enemy--

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Winning the War
Within Yourself."

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.380 align:middle line:84%
This book, it has a wonderful
message that all of us

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
are going to enjoy hearing about
today as we talk to Guy Finley.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Guy, thank you for
coming to join us.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm happy to be here.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Linda.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.500 align:middle line:10%
>> We talk about and an enemy,
the immediate thing that comes

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:10%
to our mind is war, fighting--

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Right, right.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:10%
>> --getting even, being
right, or being wrong.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.740 align:middle line:90%
What is this intimate enemy?

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there is within us--

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.680 align:middle line:84%
and I don't care who you
are, where you have been,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.000 align:middle line:90%
and what your experiences.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
We've all had moments
where from out of our mouth

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
jumped something that we
didn't want to say to somebody.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Our hand has reached and
pulled out of our pocket money

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:90%
that we shouldn't spend.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.770 align:middle line:10%
Or maybe it's just been in
the solitude of our own home

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.310 align:middle line:10%
when a certain painful
thought or feeling washed over

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:10%
us and left us feeling sad--

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:10%
those moments where it's
clear that we didn't

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:10%
choose to do what we did.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.950 align:middle line:10%
Because everybody knows.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.492 align:middle line:10%
You say something
painful to someone.

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Then you go, oh, I'm
sorry, or you feel guilty.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.070 align:middle line:84%
You beat yourself up
for having done that.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:90%
Something spoke.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Something made an action
that was defeating

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:90%
or somehow self-compromising.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Inside of us, we have
a nature whose purpose

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.380 align:middle line:90%
is not our best interest.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.850 align:middle line:84%
Look, I need to
be able to think,

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do my work.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to
being able to relate

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:84%
to another human being,
when it comes to a loving

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
nature, and things like
that, we have another nature

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:84%
that's intended to be in
the forefront of this.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:84%
The intimate enemy is
that part of ourself

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
that meets life from
this conditioned package

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.530 align:middle line:84%
of our own past, who we've
been, and who we hope to be.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
We have another
aspect of our nature,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
of our life, that
is not conditioned,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.040 align:middle line:84%
that isn't trying
to prove itself

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
according to who
it thinks it should

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:90%
be seen as or by other people.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:90%
That's the intimate enemy.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And our job as
spiritual individuals

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
wishing to become a
different kind of person

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
is to begin catching it,
waking up to its presence,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and, instead of letting
it speak for us,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
instead of it letting doing our
thinking for us, to be awake

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:90%
and aware to its presence.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And then because there
is something inside of us

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
that is greater than it, wiser
than it, broader than it,

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
it will begin to put this part
of ourself in its proper place.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:90%
You said something.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't thought about it
quite until you said it,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.525 align:middle line:84%
that we have a nature within
ourself that seems to be at war

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
and that then we seem
to have this other part.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.750 align:middle line:84%
But, you see, they're
not separate parts.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
They're interrelated.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.750 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that,
right now, thought

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.170 align:middle line:84%
life, our who we've been,
this physical existence,

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
it's more dominant than
our spiritual life.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And this book is about
helping the person first

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
recognize that this reversal is
taking place so that then they

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.940 align:middle line:84%
can begin to do the
right kind of inner work,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.140 align:middle line:84%
the right awakening that
will replace and put--

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
allow the natural relationship
to express itself.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you think that this
is something that we naturally

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:90%
know that we have a part of us?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Like, for instance,
someone will say, well,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if she has
a hidden agenda.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Is what you're saying
is that we have

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
our own hidden agenda that we
aren't consciously aware of?

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
There is something in
us, 24 hours a day,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that is perpetrating and
perpetuating its agenda.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And its agenda is the seemingly
safe and secure continuation

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.940 align:middle line:84%
of our presently known
sense of ourself.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Who we really are does not
need to think about itself

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:90%
to know itself.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.250 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
approved or disapproved

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.530 align:middle line:90%
to feel good or feel bad.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.690 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, we are a hidden-agenda
machine that defeats itself

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.820 align:middle line:90%
as often as it helps itself.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And our task is to
wake up to this process

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
because the very awareness
of this nature that

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.440 align:middle line:84%
operates in our unawareness
changes our relationship

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems that in our
society today that the way we

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.720 align:middle line:84%
approach solving problems
is to always blame.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.150 align:middle line:90%
It's the other person.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.680 align:middle line:90%
It's the other guy.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
It's their fault. They're
making me feel this way.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what you're saying is
that this is the reverse of how

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.480 align:middle line:84%
we should be looking
at solutions.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most powerful
spiritual exercises

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of the
earth, or in any universe,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.240 align:middle line:84%
is if a man or a woman would
simply, just as an experiment,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
try to spend 24 hours without
blaming anyone or complaining

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:90%
about anything.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:90%
You know what would happened?

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They would start to become
conscious of the fact

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.810 align:middle line:84%
that there is that wish on their
part to act out what they know

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
is true, while
within them dwells

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
an entirely other new,
different kind of creature that

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%
can't wait to lash out
at someone or something

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.440 align:middle line:84%
or convince itself that the
reason it feels the way it does

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is because of what's
happening outside of us.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
As long as you and
I, or anyone else,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:84%
continue to find our sense of
self from anything exterior

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves, we
will remain not only

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.110 align:middle line:84%
the victim of the
moment in which we're

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
finding that sense of
ourself but addicted

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.610 align:middle line:84%
to continuing to find solutions
to what we say is the problem.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.440 align:middle line:84%
It is an inner
battle, and that's

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.900 align:middle line:90%
where we have to do the work.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of times, if
we are trying to say, oh--

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
if we say, OK, today I am
not going to blame anyone.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Today I will not be judgemental.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:90%
What happens when we do that?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what happens.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like what you had said
earlier about in the Bible

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
about Paul, that he
recognized this in himself.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
The things that he didn't want
to do he found himself doing.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> --doing.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I have a phrase.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.750 align:middle line:84%
It goes, two steps forward and
three steps back, but so what?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Two steps forward and three
steps back, but so what?

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's so
much to talk about.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
Look, I say one day
to myself, you know,

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:90%
yesterday, I was at work.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And I watched old
Bill over there.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And he was staring at me out
of the corner of his eye,

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and he was whispering
to my superior.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure he's
trying to sink my ship.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.000 align:middle line:84%
You sit there at
your desk, and it's

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.430 align:middle line:84%
boil, boil, toil and
trouble, this churning

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:90%
going on inside of you.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.692 align:middle line:10%
And now your whole day is in,
what-- relationship with a fear

00:08:34.692 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:10%
that itself is
trying to figure out

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:10%
how to get Bill to see the light
and then straighten out people

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.880 align:middle line:10%
that Bill may not even
have talked to about you.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.922 align:middle line:10%
You know what I'm saying?

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:10%
So they really
think you're nuts.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.172 align:middle line:10%
When if you were awake
to it, you could say,

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:10%
OK, you know, tomorrow
when I go to work,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:10%
with God as my witness, I'm
going to have my own life.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.680 align:middle line:84%
That's the aim
because I understand

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't have my own life
when Bill's directing it.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:90%
It's not even Bill.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:90%
It's my thoughts about him.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So I sit there, and I say,
I'm not going to do it.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
Boil, boil, toil and trouble.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.800 align:middle line:90%
The energy starts.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I started getting upset.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And in spite of
myself, like Paul said,

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I don't do the
good I want to do.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I do the evil I don't, and
I'm out there fighting again.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.860 align:middle line:90%
But listen to this.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Something else has happened.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I have awakened
for a split second

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and tasted the fact that there
is my will to do what is true.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And within me there
is another will

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.030 align:middle line:90%
that wants to serve itself.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what a moment.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
Because it awakens
inside of a person

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:90%
something I don't have a--

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I call it spiritual intolerance,
when I will no longer put up

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.350 align:middle line:84%
with one part of
myself that wants

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.705 align:middle line:84%
to pursue the ends that punish
me and everyone else around me.

00:09:46.705 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see the
movie "High Noon?"

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:51.120 align:middle line:90%
>> What a great film.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end, when he
was sure he was going to die,

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
he went out to
face the bad guys.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And by his very act of
courage, the townspeople

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:84%
that had abandoned him took
his side, and he won the day.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:84%
When you and I are sure that
of ourselves we cannot do

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
something but will nevertheless
resolve and stand up to that

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.050 align:middle line:84%
which is defeating us,
God himself, truth itself,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:84%
the light, Christ,
whatever word, it comes in.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:90%
It takes your side.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And it knocks all
the bad guys down.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And you stand there,
and you realize,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I have found the secret of life.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.780 align:middle line:84%
I've been afraid
of being defeated,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.410 align:middle line:84%
when the answer was not
to run from the battle

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.560 align:middle line:84%
but to go into it
deliberately to find out

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
me when I do what

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.550 align:middle line:90%
is true for the sake of truth.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And wait until you do.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the greatest
thing in the world.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So actually by just stopping
and recognizing who this enemy

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is, or what this enemy is,
or what this thought is,

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.760 align:middle line:90%
that is half the battle.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>> At least half the
battle, maybe 90%,

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.680 align:middle line:84%
simply learning to
have a new priority.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
Our priorities now all have
to do with our physical life.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what people say.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.780 align:middle line:84%
What can I do to get more,
to be more, have more, be

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
seen by more?

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:90%
On and on it goes.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
When I can start
recognizing that--

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Vernon Howard, this man I
once knew, a great teacher.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.240 align:middle line:84%
he said, it is wise to seek
immortality because time

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.070 align:middle line:90%
defeats all other ambitions.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And when I can start really
getting the drift of that,

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.890 align:middle line:84%
my priorities are
going to change.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I can want to be awake
sitting here more

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:90%
than I want to be approved of.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I can want to be connected
to something higher

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.630 align:middle line:84%
more than I want to
get someplace faster--

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
endless opportunities for me to
change my relationship in life

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and, by doing so,
changing not only

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.220 align:middle line:84%
my experience but
my actual nature.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.728 align:middle line:84%
>> So immortality
actually begins now.

00:11:50.728 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I have another saying.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:90%
It's now or never.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Now or never.

00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, as we look
at who we are, one

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
of the things that you
talk about in the book

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that we
have multiple selves

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and like many, many voices
that are there talking to us

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and giving us
different messages.

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
How do we know which
of these selves

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is giving us the
correct message?

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> There is actually a way.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But everything begins
with intention.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Everything begins with our wish
to be a more whole human being.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And then as that wish
comes to be more whole,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.900 align:middle line:84%
from it comes the
discovery that we're not.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.400 align:middle line:90%
Look, you know, if you talk--

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.207 align:middle line:84%
who would be the most
insane human being?

00:12:39.207 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
The sickest human
being on the surface

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.040 align:middle line:84%
the earth would be the
one who is convinced

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.513 align:middle line:90%
that he didn't have a problem.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:45.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.890 align:middle line:84%
So in proportion to
my ability to start

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
waking up to the fact that
one minute I am this person.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:90%
The next minute I'm that person.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.173 align:middle line:90%
Then I go to church.

00:12:53.173 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm this person.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm all these various
people in some kind

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:84%
of constant scramble
for my mouth.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.990 align:middle line:84%
That very awareness begins to
produce a kind of unification

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:90%
in me.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.340 align:middle line:84%
But more important
than that is that,

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
in my awareness of
this divisive nature,

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.070 align:middle line:84%
I start to long for
something that isn't divided.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Rather than find myself in one
temporary person after the next

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and one temporary
pursuit and purpose,

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I start to long for a
purpose and a person

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:84%
within myself that isn't so
divided and outwardly driven.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we'll come right back
in just a moment and continue

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:34.100 align:middle line:84%
with these wonderful insights as
we share about your great book,

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.012 align:middle line:90%
"The Intimate Enemy."

00:13:35.012 --> 00:13:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm Linda Rachel, and we're with
the "World of Wisdom" today.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And Guy Finley, the
author of the new book

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.330 align:middle line:90%
"The Intimate Enemy--

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:84%
The War Within
Us," is here today.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Would you tell us a little
bit more about this war

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:90%
that we have inside of us--

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
is we all experience
painful things

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.020 align:middle line:84%
in our lives or painful
experiences or problems.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.830 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we can break
away from these patterns

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that we continually follow
that causes these problems?

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.670 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that is
in my new book that I think is

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the least understood
and, on the opposite side,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.760 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful thing a person
could come to understand is

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that the things that drive
us through these negative,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I call them, circles of self
have to do with the advent

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.550 align:middle line:84%
of a painful thought or
feeling that comes to us.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:10%
I'm sitting at home,
and I'm 35 years old.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:10%
I swore, when I was 18, I'd have
$1 million by the time I was 30

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.065 align:middle line:10%
or that I'd be
this or the other.

00:14:49.065 --> 00:14:50.857 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sitting there,
and all of a sudden,

00:14:50.857 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:10%
oh, you know, you're nothing.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.060 align:middle line:90%
Look at you.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.860 align:middle line:90%
You haven't got two farthings.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:90%
No one loves you.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And no one sees
your-- and who doesn't

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:90%
think they're brilliant?

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
No one understands you,
so forth and so on.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.300 align:middle line:90%
Here comes this painful state.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can understand that.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm alone now.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be alone
for the rest of my life.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.650 align:middle line:84%
What do we do when that
negative state comes?

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
The minute that
painful energy gets

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.440 align:middle line:84%
in there, all caused,
incidentally, by thought,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.240 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:90%
I begin to see a new future.

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow I'm going
to start over.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to work harder.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to lose 50 pounds.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.375 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to, God help
me, get plastic surgery.

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do this.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.125 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do that.

00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So this negative thought, this
seed thought, this energy,

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:84%
produces a future for me in
which I will not be suffering

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.660 align:middle line:90%
from what I'm suffering from.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to feel the
promise and the goodness

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:90%
of what I think will be coming.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But if we're honest at all,
we never get to that moment.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.397 align:middle line:84%
And even if we do, it's
hopelessly incomplete,

00:15:55.397 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
meaning that I'm just visited
by something else that tells me,

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
well, the next
thing I have to do

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:00.478 align:middle line:90%
is this, that, and the other.

00:16:00.478 --> 00:16:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Listen to this completely
different answer.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.680 align:middle line:84%
The negative state,
the energy, is

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.430 align:middle line:84%
produced by the thoughts
and feelings that

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:84%
have come into me because
I have compared myself

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.480 align:middle line:84%
to who I wanted to
be, which is a divided

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:90%
thought in the first place.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Those energies have
no real life outside

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:84%
of what I give to them
in my unconsciousness.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:84%
My awareness of the fact
that these negative thoughts

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
and feelings and the
energies that they produce,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
as subtle as they may be and as
deep or powerful as they seem

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:84%
to be, that they
have no life outside

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:84%
of the mechanical moment
in which they were produced

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
allows me to start
doing something I've

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%
never done before.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:90%
I can sit there in my home.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:90%
And this is an old--

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I go, darkness, I
laugh in your face.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually
challenge them

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.260 align:middle line:84%
by applying the truth of
what I know about them

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.960 align:middle line:84%
instead of allowing those
negative states to tell me

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:84%
who I am and how
to get out of them.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:90%
That painful state, Linda--

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and everyone has to try this to
discover the strength in it--

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:90%
it comes, and it goes.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.246 align:middle line:84%
It will reach a certain
point, a pitch where you think

00:17:13.246 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:90%
it's the end of your life.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:90%
And listen to this.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:90%
It is the end of your life.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the end of that
life that belonged

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.119 align:middle line:84%
to the intimate enemy
whose pursuit starts

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:25.700 align:middle line:84%
with a punishment,
winds up with a promise,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:84%
and yet never goes
anywhere except around

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:90%
and around and around.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:84%
The discovery that
negative states

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
have no life outside
of the one we give them

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
and our willingness to
challenge them out on that basis

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
shows us that internally
there is an ocean,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.240 align:middle line:90%
and there are waves.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We've been taking
ourself as the waves.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But when we can begin to
recognize that the waves, what

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
they are, and how they
behave, and let them go,

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.500 align:middle line:84%
suddenly there is a new kind
of awareness within ourselves

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.780 align:middle line:84%
of something that's more
permanent, something more

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:84%
eternal, and God,
and, wonderfully,

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:84%
something that isn't that kind
of endless punishment born out

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.860 align:middle line:84%
of the pursuit of
some new promise.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have a friend who
has a problem with her weight.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was talking to
her and saying, you look fine.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.360 align:middle line:84%
You look like-- she
says, no, I don't.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.760 align:middle line:90%
She says, this is reality.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Reality is that I'm overweight,
and I look terrible.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.070 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way
I'm going to feel,

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.560 align:middle line:84%
and nothing you're going to
say is going to change my mind.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So in other words,
her perception

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
colored what was reality,
and it was reality for her.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, first of all, you
couldn't be more right.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.570 align:middle line:84%
God help us, men
and women alike,

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.950 align:middle line:90%
we look in these magazines.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.810 align:middle line:90%
We see these TV shows.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have my background
is in show business.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my 20s, you
know I came from that world.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
These men and women that
these other men and women

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.640 align:middle line:84%
are idolizing, they're,
every one of them, virtually

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.940 align:middle line:90%
a wreck--

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.313 align:middle line:84%
can't stand themselves,
can't walk by a mirror

00:18:58.313 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:90%
without looking in it.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.100 align:middle line:90%
But here's the real point.

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.227 align:middle line:84%
The punishment that comes
with looking at myself

00:19:03.227 --> 00:19:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and then feeling bad about the
way I look because, in my mind,

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I've got a picture over
here and it doesn't match,

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.065 align:middle line:84%
that's never going to give me
the impetus to lose the weight.

00:19:12.065 --> 00:19:13.940 align:middle line:84%
If you ever hear somebody
say, you know what?

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm overweight, and
I feel terrible,

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.310 align:middle line:84%
meaning that it's
uncomfortable for me

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to carry around
this weight, there's

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of something
that not only would be natural

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
for them to lose the
weight, but they would have

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:90%
the genuine need behind it.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The picture of myself as
being someone who is too heavy

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
is replaced by a
picture of myself

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.910 align:middle line:84%
in Tahiti, which is replaced
by a picture of myself

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.150 align:middle line:84%
as the president of a
Fortune 500 company.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.790 align:middle line:84%
So those wants, they're
replaced just like that.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
The need to be a different human
being, no matter what level it

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.700 align:middle line:84%
is, from physical all
the way to spiritual,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that's a real basis by which
a person can produce change.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's what my book does.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:84%
It produces the need to become a
different order of human being.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
you talk about in your book,

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
it's that we need to have
inside-out thinking--

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Well said.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:05.460 align:middle line:84%
>> --rather than the
other way around.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's confusing to think
that we need to come inside

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to look inside.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.690 align:middle line:84%
But yet, on the other hand,
you say in one part of the book

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that very few of us really have
conversations or communication

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.370 align:middle line:84%
with other people, where it's
because we're so "I" centered.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.560 align:middle line:90%
So how do you resolve that?

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.837 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting down at the dinner
table, and we're not listening.

00:20:31.837 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:84%
We're waiting for
the person to finish

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.380 align:middle line:90%
so we can say what's so clever.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:84%
God willing, we
should be clever.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:84%
Look, we can do it,
you and I right now.

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.400 align:middle line:90%
What better way than by example?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:90%
We come awake.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:84%
We bring ourselves
right into this moment,

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
even though there's
cameras around us

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.240 align:middle line:90%
and all that business.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:90%
We just come.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:84%
We bring ourselves
into the room.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we are
aware of ourselves,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that awareness precludes
the activity of thought.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, the moment that
awareness comes in and thought

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.913 align:middle line:84%
is momentarily
encompassed, it's not

00:21:04.913 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:90%
going to get rid of thought.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.810 align:middle line:84%
But, instead, thought
will now be that which

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.300 align:middle line:90%
passes through this awareness.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Before, I was identified
with every single thought

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:90%
that passed through me.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So when I wake up for a second
and I come aware of myself,

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.790 align:middle line:84%
I can watch the quality of
the content of these thoughts

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
and feelings as
they come through.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.280 align:middle line:84%
>> This awakening process
is something that goes

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:90%
on for our entire life.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.160 align:middle line:90%
It never ends.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no end to it.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.567 align:middle line:84%
You just said one of my
very favorite things.

00:21:35.567 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the most exciting
thing in the world

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.420 align:middle line:84%
when a man or a woman stumbles
onto a real, true way.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.120 align:middle line:84%
They begin to understand
the whole of life.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And I mean this from
the bottom of my heart.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:84%
The whole of life is
there just for them.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everything,
every split second

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.660 align:middle line:90%
was created just for you.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we had time, I
could prove that to you,

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that every man and
woman on the earth

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
is the center of the universe.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Because God made
them that way so

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that they could have
the lessons that only

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
they could have in those
moments that everything

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
had to cooperate
to bring to them.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And yet everyone can
have those lessons.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I really hope that
as you continue going across

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:84%
the country, and speaking in
these workshops and seminars,

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:84%
and talking about your books
that people will be able

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:90%
to look inward--

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> --to be able to see
what it is that they need.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So regardless of how
many books that we read,

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.727 align:middle line:84%
and this is a wonderful
one, I might add,

00:22:32.727 --> 00:22:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and I hope that our
audience will read

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.170 align:middle line:90%
this, "The Intimate Enemy--

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Winning the War
Within Yourself,"

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.540 align:middle line:84%
that even though we read these
books that it is something

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.540 align:middle line:84%
we have to decide within
ourselves that we want.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> We must do the work.
