00:00:05.976 --> 00:01:08.422 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.422 --> 00:01:09.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to the
"World of Wisdom."

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.540 align:middle line:90%
My name is Linda Rachel.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And today we have, as a
special guest, Dr. David Myers.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.300 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Myers is an author of the
book "Heartful Parenting."

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Myers, thank you so much
for visiting with us today.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm glad to be here.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Myers, you have a
PhD in clinical psychology,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're also a member
of the American Academy

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:90%
of Psychotherapists.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed
that, recently, you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.720 align:middle line:90%
were a speaker at the Atlanta--

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.118 align:middle line:84%
it was in Alabama, a governor's
conference on parenting.

00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I was the keynote
speaker at the Alabama

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Governor's Conference.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
Tell us some things that you
were talking to these governors

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, basically, the book
is about heartful parenting,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and that was my reason for
being the keynote speaker.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.810 align:middle line:84%
The idea was to tie-in the
idea of heartful parenting

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
with emotional intelligence,
emotional intelligence

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.199 align:middle line:84%
being the concept of
empathy, self-awareness,

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.200 align:middle line:84%
self motivation, and
social effectiveness.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And so there were
many parents there,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
along with
professionals, who wanted

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:90%
to hear about the connections.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I was glad to be
there to give them that talk.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And in what respect do you
feel that this is a different

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.430 align:middle line:84%
approach from your other
fellow workers in your field?

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Generally, the books, as
well as other professionals,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.140 align:middle line:84%
have a tendency to focus on
behavior, behavior being,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:90%
what does my child do?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Does my child go to school?

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Does my child get good grades?

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Does my child perform well
in athletics, and so on.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.430 align:middle line:84%
The difference in
heartful parenting

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.540 align:middle line:84%
is that we're concerned about
what happens inside the child

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and how those inside
happenings connect

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:90%
with the insides of the parent.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Heartfulness has to do with
being fully there, fully

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.290 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
If you're just concentrating
on the behavior

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
of the child or the parent,
what you're focusing on

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:90%
is just the external.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.910 align:middle line:84%
What we want to do is look on
the insides, the processing,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
what makes the child alive,
what makes the parent alive,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and how those two
sets of pieces come

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:84%
together so that there is
a connection between parent

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.210 align:middle line:90%
and child.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Then there's a fullness
to the parenting process

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.800 align:middle line:84%
rather than just the parent
telling a child, one up,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.150 align:middle line:84%
one down, what to do, what
not to do, and how to do it.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you think that there
is a certain soulfulness that is

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.160 align:middle line:90%
in parenting?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:10%
>> There's an incredible
soulfulness in parenting.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.150 align:middle line:10%
When children come into the
world, there's a natural bond.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:10%
But if we, as parents,
begin to emphasize

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.230 align:middle line:10%
achievement and
external behavior,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:10%
we tend to minimize that bond.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
We may realize that
bond is later on,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
but the child doesn't
get to experience

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:90%
that on a daily basis.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The parent doesn't experience
it in on a daily basis.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.830 align:middle line:84%
Life becomes sort of bland,
empty, and shell-like.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
So what we want to do for
the child and the parent

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
is have a soulful connection
so that the hearts connect,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's aliveness
around emotionality.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, do you think that
sometimes we, our society,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:10%
sets us up for this
achievement orientation.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.940 align:middle line:84%
In school, certain things are
to be achieved by that child.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And for the parent
in their own work,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
certain things are
to be achieved.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And we don't really get down
to that true soulfulness

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.070 align:middle line:90%
or what the person feels inside.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So when we come
home and the group

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
is there, the parent
and the child,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
we don't even communicate at
that level of soulfulness.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
We still are saying,
what did you do?

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:90%
Did you do this correctly?

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:90%
Or did you perform very well?

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Our major thrust in this
society has to do with money.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Money comes around
achievement, if you're

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.625 align:middle line:84%
a great baseball player, a
basketball player, or whatever,

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:02.320 align:middle line:90%
a engineer.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.410 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, what we
need to do is balance

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
that so that we can become
more effective athletics

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
or effective vocationally,
and so on, by using what's

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:90%
inside as emotional resources.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.897 align:middle line:84%
We usually know in our
heads what we need to do.

00:05:20.897 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't have
that energy, that

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
aliveness to put the drive into
it to be self-motivated to know

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
what to do, then you
become kind of a robot,

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.140 align:middle line:84%
an automaton of the society and
become achievement-oriented.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And then there's an
emptiness that sets in.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.480 align:middle line:84%
And people use drugs
and alcohol, and so on.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Or they become
achievement-oriented

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.320 align:middle line:84%
alcoholics, if you will, and try
to replace that emptiness, that

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.900 align:middle line:84%
heartfulness with
doing the extra mile.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are a lot of
people, parents in particular,

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.880 align:middle line:84%
who are very successful
maybe in their careers,

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:90%
but they feel very empty.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
The divorce rate in
America is quite high.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Our alcohol rates
are quite high.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And we could just go
on with statistics.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.910 align:middle line:84%
But we all know that because
of this craziness, if you will,

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
people are turning
to spirituality.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
They are more and more, in
droves, wanting something

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that's transcendent to get
beyond this normal, everyday

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:90%
achievement orientation.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you think it's
possible then for us as we go

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:84%
into the year 2000 to have
a concept of spirituality

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and psychology together?

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very much so.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And 2000 may be the millennium
that sets this all apart.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And we know that it's a
marker and that things are

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:90%
happening faster and faster.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
But inside, we're
still struggling with,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
how are we going
to be different?

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
How are we going
to be more alive?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to
be more connected?

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:84%
We also know that the earth
is having some difficulties.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Many people are becoming
very aware of global warming,

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And our connection has to
be with our Mother Earth.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.360 align:middle line:84%
If we're not connected and
we destroy Mother Earth,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:84%
we end up with more diseases,
such as cancer, and so on.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.940 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be very
careful about being

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.220 align:middle line:90%
connected with the all.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So whether or not we're
talking about a global

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
consciousness or we're talking
about consciousness within

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
the environment of our home,
it has to start within our own

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:90%
hearts then.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And it projects outward.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.770 align:middle line:84%
How do you think that we can
build this kind of connection

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.480 align:middle line:90%
with our children?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You talk about a secret
ingredient to success

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:90%
is connectedness.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, we
have to think about what

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:90%
connectedness means.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Connectedness means that I
feel inside the energies that

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
occur inside of me, and
I also feel the energies

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.300 align:middle line:90%
of those people around me.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a big glass
wall that separates me

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:90%
from the rest of the world.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
As a function of
nurturing connectedness,

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to pay
attention to how

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
I am, what I do with
who I am, and how

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I block my emotional
energies, how I

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.710 align:middle line:90%
nurture my emotional energies.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I then am going to use that
knowledge and that energy

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
to connect with my child to
become very inquisitive, very

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
nurturing, very
expressive about who

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.059 align:middle line:84%
I am so that my children become
expressive about who they are.

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.799 align:middle line:90%
I serve as a role model.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Our children learn from
us based on what we do.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:84%
By having that connection,
by encouraging that

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:84%
from very, very
early, even preverbal,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
feeling the energies,
and allowing my child

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.490 align:middle line:84%
to feel my energies and not be
frightened by that intensity,

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm encouraging connectedness.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Children seem to
be very perceptive.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, they'll say,
what's wrong, Mommy?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the mommy
says, oh, nothing.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
What are we teaching our
children when we do that?

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> That's my version
of craziness.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Craziness is distorting reality.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We know that we're
feeling something.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Our child must be
feeling something

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:90%
in order to ask that question.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:90%
Let's honor the moment.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's stay connected
with, she must

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.680 align:middle line:90%
be asking me that for a reason.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Even if I'm not
aware that there's

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.670 align:middle line:84%
something uncomfortable,
let me use that

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.640 align:middle line:90%
as a moment of self-awareness.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Ah, my child has asked
me, what's wrong?

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I need to
take a quick look,

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
or maybe I know, and
share that in a way

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.670 align:middle line:90%
that my child will understand.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a tricky tight-wire rope
to walk that we don't overwhelm

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.800 align:middle line:84%
our children with
too much information,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
but we give them
enough information that

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:90%
validates their experience.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And they are so open,
and they're so receptive.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to do
anything to discourage that.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.646 align:middle line:84%
We want to encourage them
to use it constructively.

00:09:58.646 --> 00:10:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you feel like maybe
we are blocking some of this,

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:90%
our own emotionality?

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why,
as parents, it's

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.520 align:middle line:84%
difficult to share
with our children

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.620 align:middle line:84%
because we've
blocked it ourselves.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of us grew up in an age
where children were to be seen

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.540 align:middle line:90%
and not heard.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Many of our parents were
of that Depression age

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
where we needed to get on with
getting food on the table.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:90%
We needed to go to work.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.060 align:middle line:90%
We needed to get things done.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:84%
So that was then
passed on to us.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:84%
Or the other thing that
sometimes was passed on to us

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:84%
was the nature of
permissiveness.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're back to
walking a tight-wire rope.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:84%
As a result of
our childhoods, we

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:84%
have to go back and
recollect those aspects

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.600 align:middle line:84%
that we may have left behind
because of our parent's

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.980 align:middle line:90%
inadequacies.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.350 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing
as a perfect parent.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:48.903 align:middle line:90%
Parents are vulnerable.

00:10:48.903 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:84%
They have their own histories,
and they project that

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.370 align:middle line:90%
onto their children.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So by doing the introspective
work, we can reverse that path

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:90%
and take a more balanced path.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think so many people
who become parents really are

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.740 align:middle line:84%
just instinctually relying on
what their parents taught them?

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if we want
to call it instinctual,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:84%
but they do operate
out of what they know.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:90%
They've been in a habit path.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:90%
My mother did this.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, I'm going to do this.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Or the opposite, which
is sort of the same--

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.760 align:middle line:84%
my mother did this, so I'm going
to do the opposite of that.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.260 align:middle line:10%
And that's where
this whole business

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:10%
of whether a parent's too
strict or too permissive

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:10%
ties into what
their parents did.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:10%
Well, it was good enough for
me, and look how I turned out.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:10%
But that belies who
our children are.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:90%
We are not our children.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.590 align:middle line:84%
We have to respond
to them individually,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:84%
who they are, their
temperaments, what

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.250 align:middle line:90%
they're going through.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
That's a very different
time than the time

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:90%
that we grew up in.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to honor that
this is now, and that was then.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not just a matter of
a course that could have been

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.900 align:middle line:84%
taken 20 years ago or a
course that you can take now,

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.110 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually being alive
in the moment with that child.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one of the aspects
of emotional intelligence--

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.630 align:middle line:90%
self-awareness.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:90%
What's happening now?

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:09.613 align:middle line:90%
And how is that different?

00:12:09.613 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, you said in your
book that you've learned

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.845 align:middle line:90%
a lot from your own children.

00:12:14.845 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to talk to
you a little bit more

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.740 align:middle line:90%
about that when we come back.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.545 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:23.980 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.562 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.562 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back to
the "World of Wisdom."

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm Linda Rachel.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And we have as our guest
today Dr. David Myers.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Myers' book is
"Heartful Parenting--

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Connecting Parenting and
Emotional Intelligence."

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Myers, it's nice
to have you with us.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.550 align:middle line:84%
When we went to break, we were
talking about your own children

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
have taught you some
important lessons.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It seems like, many
times, children

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
are very open and honest
about their feelings, I guess,

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.325 align:middle line:84%
until they unlearn
those things--

00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:02.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah.

00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> --from us as parents.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.300 align:middle line:84%
What are some things that
your children have taught you?

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.450 align:middle line:10%
>> There were two very
significant experiences.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:10%
One was when our
family dog died.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.000 align:middle line:10%
I rounded up the children,
placed them in my lap,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.600 align:middle line:10%
and encouraged them to cry
and have all their feelings

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.510 align:middle line:10%
about the loss of their
dog, and my dog as well.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And what I served was was kind
of the encouraging, nurturing

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:90%
father.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that
they did their work.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And then about 30, 40 minutes
later, they were off playing,

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was if it
had not happened.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:90%
They processed it.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I then notice that I had
gone into a depression

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.620 align:middle line:84%
and realized, two weeks later,
that the work that my children

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:90%
had done, I had not done.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Once I repeated that release
work that they had done,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.030 align:middle line:84%
the loss of that
dog just went away.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.070 align:middle line:84%
It was a remarkable lesson
in blocking versus releasing.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.900 align:middle line:90%
So that was one lesson.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.700 align:middle line:84%
The other lesson
was my youngest son

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:84%
was very interested
in racquetball.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And I have been an avid
racquetball player myself.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And I noticed that if I became
too excited about racquetball,

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:90%
he would sort of diminish.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And then as I would
back off, he would

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.170 align:middle line:84%
start coming back and being
very excited about it.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And if I would get
overly excited,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.940 align:middle line:90%
he'd start backing off.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.950 align:middle line:90%
And I noticed two things then.

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:84%
One was that I was reliving
my childhood through my son.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And he was giving me
a wonderful lesson--

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.260 align:middle line:84%
don't relive your
childhood through me.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.040 align:middle line:84%
The other was that I needed
to match my energies with his

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and not overwhelm
him with who I was.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.050 align:middle line:84%
Those were two
great lessons that

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.830 align:middle line:84%
come through in the book
in a lot of other ways.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's very
difficult to, as a parent,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
to let your child
have their own space,

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and even for spouses to
give each other space.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
How important is that
in the family structure?

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's incredibly important
to have a balance between space

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.260 align:middle line:90%
and connectedness.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're either
overwhelming this person

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
with invading them, or
you're becoming isolated.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.980 align:middle line:84%
One way that this
balance is achieved

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:90%
is through communication.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm needing some space.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:84%
You're overwhelming me-- so
that we're talking about not

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.250 align:middle line:84%
just in terms of what
the other person does,

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.460 align:middle line:84%
but what I'm having happening
inside of my own experience.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So I can simply say
something like, I'm

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:middle line:90%
feeling overwhelmed now.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling pressured now.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.818 align:middle line:84%
Or I would like to have
some more of your time,

00:15:32.818 --> 00:15:34.860 align:middle line:84%
or I'd like to have some
more of your attention--

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.980 align:middle line:84%
so that we're into a
relationship-oriented

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
discussion as opposed to
I'm going to have my way,

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:90%
and you're not.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:84%
The book is about
relationship-oriented parenting

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to
objective-oriented parenting.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
What we do then is
learn from our children,

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.358 align:middle line:84%
and our children learn from us
rather than our children being

00:15:55.358 --> 00:15:56.900 align:middle line:84%
sort of our property
that we're going

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.660 align:middle line:84%
to mold into whatever we think
we're going to mold them into.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.835 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work.

00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it seems like we
have to have a little bit

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
of vulnerability as a parent
in order to have that sort

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
of relationship
with your children.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Extremely vulnerable.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's important that our
children understand that we

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:90%
don't have all the answers.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.570 align:middle line:90%
We can protect our children.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.050 align:middle line:90%
They need to know that.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of complete
knowledge of the world,

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
complete ability to connect, and
so on, we're learning as well.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:30.780 align:middle line:84%
Life then becomes a journey
rather than a finished product.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you think that as
parents it's important to let

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.180 align:middle line:84%
your children know
when you've been wrong?

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:90%
None of us are perfect.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
The idea of
perfectionism, I think,

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:90%
is still being toyed with.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
But I know I didn't live
up to that expectation

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%
of being perfect.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Our children need to
learn that they don't

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:90%
have to be perfect either.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And the opposite of perfection
is being on a journey,

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:90%
exploring and learning.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're
just building in what

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:90%
I call negative self-esteem.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.760 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do it right.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.740 align:middle line:84%
There must be something
wrong with me.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to be very careful as
parents to inculcate or nurture

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.280 align:middle line:84%
the idea that we
do make mistakes.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:84%
What's important is that
we stay on the road.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:90%
We go for the path.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
But we pay attention
to the processing

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.250 align:middle line:84%
of the emotional energies
while we're on that path.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you talk about
emotional energies.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
All of our emotions, we have
such a gambit of emotions,

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:27.411 align:middle line:84%
from sadness and
sorrow to anger.

00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And it is, seems like
it is, a strong energy.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a very strong energy.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And it moves mountains
if we want it to.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And the mountains can be
great that we want to move.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
distinction that I make

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:90%
in the chapter on emotionality.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.880 align:middle line:84%
We can use our emotionality
constructively,

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:90%
or we can use it destructively.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Most of us get caught up in
being fearful of the intensity.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.220 align:middle line:84%
It isn't the intensity
that hurts other people.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
It's what we do
with the intensity.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.960 align:middle line:84%
When people hit another
person out of anger,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:90%
that's destructive.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
If I'm angry and
I go off and think

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
about what I'm going to do
with my anger as opposed

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:84%
to hurting someone else, coming
back and saying, I'm angry.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:90%
Here's why I'm angry.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Can we talk about that?

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Then we've done
something constructive.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:84%
We're then working on the
relationship as opposed to,

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.385 align:middle line:84%
I'm angry, and I'm going
to make you do right.

00:18:18.385 --> 00:18:19.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's too
much of that "I'm

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.560 align:middle line:84%
going to make you do
right" stuff in parenting.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a relationship.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.510 align:middle line:84%
We, as parents, do serve
as the upper echelon.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to take that
away from the parenthood.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.830 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, we must not

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.000 align:middle line:84%
lose sight that our children
are learning human individuals.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.010 align:middle line:84%
They're not just going
to live out our path.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not just going to
be molded in our image.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.260 align:middle line:90%
We don't even want that, I hope.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard the other
day someone say, well,

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.640 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
dysfunctional family,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.065 align:middle line:90%
that's a word you hear a lot.

00:18:51.065 --> 00:18:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Someone will say,
well, are there

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.520 align:middle line:90%
really any functional families?

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Are we not all
dysfunctional in some way?

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on who you ask,
and it depends on the kind

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:90%
of dysfunction.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think in terms of
the general orientation

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
towards achievement versus
relationship orientation,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
we tend to err on the
side of achievement.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And from that angle, I think
we have a bit of dysfunction

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.400 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of
dysfunction depending

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
on how much achievement
orientation we have.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.480 align:middle line:90%
It runs on a continuum.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems difficult
for children and parents,

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
many times, to communicate
with each other,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:84%
even if they do find a time and
space when they're together,

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
actually together
as a family unit,

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:90%
to actually have downtime.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.910 align:middle line:84%
Do you think the fact that
the technology that we have

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
and the busy lives that
we have is taking away

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:90%
from this relationship?

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Clearly, our technological
orientation is a distraction.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Who we really are
is on the inside.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.790 align:middle line:84%
We've known that spiritually
for thousands of years.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
to balance all

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
this technological external
stuff with who are we

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
on the inside and to
connect with the insides

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:90%
of that other person.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.680 align:middle line:84%
That's where we really
have the meaning of life.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have soulfulness
and a full experience

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that goes way beyond whatever
I can have at the computer.

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:90%
I love playing at the computer.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.760 align:middle line:84%
But it's not like having
a soulful, enlightening

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:84%
experience where I
pick up something

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that has been left behind,
for whatever reason,

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
and put it into my
soul again, and use

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.860 align:middle line:90%
it to be more energized.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
10 years ago, I might
not even be here

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:84%
having this interview with
you if I had been stuck back

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.850 align:middle line:90%
at that spot.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess there are a
lot of vehicles or, let's say,

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.960 align:middle line:84%
resources to help us
through our communities,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
through the schools,
and through churches,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and through community
organizations.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But many times, it does come
right back to the parent.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.800 align:middle line:84%
The parent is responsible
for that nurturing process.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I see it that way.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:90%
It starts in the home.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.960 align:middle line:84%
And what the child
learns in home

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:84%
then generalizes
out into school.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So if a child doesn't have
that solid foundation,

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.860 align:middle line:84%
they may get distracted at
school or with whatever outside

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.880 align:middle line:90%
of school.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
School clearly is a
powerful influence.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to take that
away from how powerful school

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.530 align:middle line:84%
can be in the peer-group
relationships.

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
But if the child doesn't
have a foundation that's

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.070 align:middle line:84%
really solid of
connecting to, here's me.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.210 align:middle line:90%
Here's not me.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's what's good for me.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Here's what's not good for me--

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.070 align:middle line:84%
then they become that
much more vulnerable

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:90%
once they reach the school age.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.697 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what does a parent
do when they find themselves

00:21:40.697 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
in a situation where their
children are in trouble

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.930 align:middle line:84%
in school, or they've gotten
in with the wrong crowd,

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.970 align:middle line:90%
or they've gotten into drugs?

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.780 align:middle line:84%
What does the parent
do at that point?

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> They start with beginning
to express their discomfort,

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:84%
their concern, their sense of
how things have moved beyond

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:84%
where they've been, or
that they've just moved

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
in a direction that
doesn't feel good to them,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
and to begin to explore
with their children,

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.960 align:middle line:84%
how that affects
the relationship,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and how they're concerned
about what it might be doing

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.467 align:middle line:90%
for their child.

00:22:10.467 --> 00:22:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And at that point in time, they
can then explore the community

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:14.820 align:middle line:90%
resources.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And maybe just knowing,
from the child's standpoint,

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.120 align:middle line:84%
hey, my parents are so
concerned that we're going

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.000 align:middle line:90%
to explore community resources.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's stay with
what's really me.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.195 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
what's really me.

00:22:27.195 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen
over and over again

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.220 align:middle line:84%
where a child is
brought to an office,

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and just that one
visit will say,

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:36.050 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's take a look
at what's going on here

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:90%
and start on another path.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So in other words,
they might bring the child

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:84%
to the therapist to
supposedly fix that child,

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and then it actually
brings it back full circle.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.580 align:middle line:90%
We don't fix children.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:90%
We sure don't.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
parents fix children.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of
exploring, what's going wrong?

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Where is the emotional
energy being blocked?

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And how can we use
this emotional energy

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:84%
and achievement orientation to
go in a different direction?

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for
visiting with us, Dr.

pleased to be here.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:90%
