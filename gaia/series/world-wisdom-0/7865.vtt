00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Prayer can be a
very personal thing,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.680 align:middle line:90%
or part of a group activity.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:10%
There are many types of prayer
and many forms of praying.

I am Marilyn
McGuire, and you are

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:10%
watching "The Wisdom Channel."

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.440 align:middle line:84%
We are talking this morning
with Gabrielle Roth,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:84%
who is an author of a
book, "Sweat Your Prayers."

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:10%
Gabrielle, welcome to
"The Wisdom Channel."

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Marilyn.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell me, how do you
see your movement as part

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.390 align:middle line:90%
of the spiritual practice?

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.160 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
when you say sweating

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.810 align:middle line:90%
your prayers in movement?

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> As spiritual practice?

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:90%
>> As spiritual practice, yes.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the difference between
life and death is breath.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.520 align:middle line:90%
And breath is the prime mover.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Breath is the catalyst
that shakes everything

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:90%
up and keeps everything moving.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:90%
And without it, we're dead.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So my practice is about dancing
hard enough and deep enough,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and surrendering myself
to the dance in such a way

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:90%
that the breath just takes over.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Spirit takes over my body.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, movement
is spiritual practice.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
>> You speak about
different rhythms,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
that there's a set of
special rhythms that are part

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.380 align:middle line:90%
of your practice.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I started
teaching when I was 16 years

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.750 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the first maybe
10 years of my teaching,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I taught all kinds of
people-- children, seniors,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.960 align:middle line:84%
hospitalized people,
regular peoples, teenagers.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And I began to
observe that there

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:84%
were certain patterns
of movement that

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
kept expressing themselves
through the body very

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.050 align:middle line:90%
universal.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was like we had some
kind of infrastructure,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.280 align:middle line:84%
something old that connected
us to ancient and modern

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and present.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.580 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's just rhythm--

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
rhythm, rhythm--
patterns of rhythms.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I could identify
five of them flowing--

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
staccato, chaos,
lyrical, and stillness.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.370 align:middle line:90%
Each one is like a whole world.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you notice that
all of the people,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
no matter what their
ages were, had these?

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:84%
Or is there one for each
age group or each group?

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I noticed that these
were the five basic patterns,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that everybody fell
into one of them.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.060 align:middle line:84%
And as I studied the
rhythms more deeply,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.910 align:middle line:84%
I began to see how each
rhythm was connected

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.810 align:middle line:90%
to a different life cycle.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Like the birth cycle from
the ages of about 0 to 5,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.080 align:middle line:90%
we're totally into flowing.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.570 align:middle line:84%
We're just into following
the flow of our energy.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
If you watch a toddler,
you see that they sit.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.940 align:middle line:90%
They stand.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.880 align:middle line:90%
They burp.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:90%
They're hungry.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.480 align:middle line:90%
They cry.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:90%
They sleep.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all about rhythm.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
They're just like really
hooked into their own rhythm.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And a mother follows that
rhythm around and supports it.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And in childhood,
from about 5 to 10,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.500 align:middle line:84%
everything becomes very
staccato, very linear,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:90%
very expressive.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And this is another rhythm.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.880 align:middle line:90%
There's flow and staccato.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, this is the second.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, staccato is
the second rhythm,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.625 align:middle line:84%
which is more connected to the
heart and to being expressive,

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:45.425 align:middle line:90%
to the exhale--

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:90%
[AUDIO OUT] --governs childhood.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So that you see if you
go to a grammar school,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
you see that everything's
being done in lines.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.358 align:middle line:84%
You know, the kids
are standing in lines,

00:03:58.358 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:84%
throwing balls in lines, writing
in lines, reading in lines.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like when we're developing
that part of the brain,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:90%
the part of the self.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.630 align:middle line:84%
And puberty is usually
governed by chaos,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.830 align:middle line:90%
which is the third rhythm.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And chaos is where the flowing
and the staccato come together.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And that rhythm is, if
you go into a high school,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:90%
you'll see that rhythm.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelming.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.890 align:middle line:90%
It's like chaos.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, the kids are
just all over the place.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Unformed.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Just kind of wild,
and rooted but wild.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I know just what you mean.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just a sense.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.900 align:middle line:84%
If you think about high school,
you know exactly what chaos is.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
And chaos is
connected to the mind.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's connected to water.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
water is the fluids

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of the being of the
mind that are all

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire body,
the intelligence of who we are.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And lyrical is the rhythm
of self-realization.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:90%
It's the rhythm of maturity.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle line:90%
It's the rhythm of trance.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
It's like in flowing, we connect
to the flow of our own energy,

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:90%
to our physical energy.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And we learn to
follow our own flow

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and to pay attention to
our own basic rhythm.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.140 align:middle line:84%
In staccato, we
learn to express it

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.930 align:middle line:84%
and to define the
flow of our energy.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
In chaos, we learn how to let go
all together and just surrender

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper
intuitive energy that

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:90%
is trying to break through us.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:84%
And in lyrical, it's
like we shift into that--

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.320 align:middle line:84%
having let go of
everything in chaos,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.490 align:middle line:84%
we kind of shift into a
lyrical state of being,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:90%
a light state of being.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:90%
We lighten up.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
We move into a more
trance-like type of movement.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And in stillness,
the fifth rhythm,

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:90%
we fall into an emptier dance.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.000 align:middle line:84%
We connect to the void, a more
contemplative way of dancing.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, we
sit in meditation.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.810 align:middle line:90%
But we sit in meditation.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:10%
It's like having dramatically
released ourselves

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:10%
and dynamically moved ourselves.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.280 align:middle line:10%
We end up sitting in a
very alive state of being.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything is turned
on and plugged in.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:84%
The breath has really
catalyzed our energy.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we really are sitting
in the depths of the selves,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.680 align:middle line:90%
rather than sitting--

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
like, if we just walk out of the
room and sit and light a candle

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and try to meditate to find
kind of an empty still state

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.890 align:middle line:84%
of mind, it's like, usually,
we're filled with stress.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
We have all kinds
of anxiety going on.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:90%
We have to-do list.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.275 align:middle line:90%
And we have things on our mind.

00:06:42.275 --> 00:06:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And the ego's in there with
all the shoulds and coulds

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:90%
and would'ves.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And so we sit in all of that.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a long
time to quiet the mind.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the fastest
way to still the mind

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:90%
is to move the body.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:84%
So once we've moved
through these five rhythms

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:84%
and we come to the final
rhythm of stillness,

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.410 align:middle line:84%
we can really sit
in that still place.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.875 align:middle line:84%
We can really have
a still mind and sit

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:09.380 align:middle line:84%
in the empty space within us
for however long it lasts.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And then life brings more
to-do lists, more stresses,

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.640 align:middle line:84%
more things to think about,
things to worry about,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:90%
things to do.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
it's a practice,

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.880 align:middle line:90%
so that we do it every day.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.210 align:middle line:84%
So that every day, we're
releasing and letting go.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And every day, we're finding
that empty space within us.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>> This is fascinating.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
I see your rhythm in
sort of two levels.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
One, it kind of goes along
with the stages of life.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a certain rhythm for
a certain age or place in life.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet, on a daily
basis, we still

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:90%
contain all of these rhythms.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And we still use all
of these rhythms.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And so we download the
energy of these rhythms

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to enable us to sit
as an empty vessel.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Is that kind of--

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it is.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
It's like each
rhythm is a teacher.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, I have a flowing rhythm
as my natural state of being.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Some people are very staccato,
much more defined and linear.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm very process-oriented,
more laid back.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And some people are
more wild and chaotic,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
something like a Robin
Williams monologue.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Some people are much more
lyrical, light, and spacious.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:90%
And some people are very still.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really an incredible
thing to know your home rhythm.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Because then you know
that that's your energy.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a statement
of your energy.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to
see the whole world

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.685 align:middle line:84%
through the
perspective of energy.

00:08:44.685 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like an
enneagram of something.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.790 align:middle line:90%
You have a home rhythm.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I like that idea.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, only it's a lot
kinder than the enneagram.

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure it is.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:52.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it is.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Although the rhythms
have a shadow side as well.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow side, well,
because we resist our rhythm.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.800 align:middle line:90%
And we resist the breath.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And we resist movement.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Then that puts us in the shadow
side of our energy field.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So the shadow side of
flowing is to be very inert.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:84%
And people who are flowing
types know inertia very well.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:23.620 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of ah, moving,
but just very resistant.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow
side of staccato is

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.810 align:middle line:84%
to be very brittle
and edgy and uptight.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow side of
chaos is to be scattered

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:90%
in all over the place.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow side of
lyrical is to be spaced out.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow side of
stillness is to be numb.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Nothing goes in and
nothing comes out,

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:90%
just kind of shut down.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And so once you know
your home base rhythm,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.620 align:middle line:84%
you also see where
you go when you're

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.900 align:middle line:90%
disconnected from your energy.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:90%
And it's like you have a map.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.130 align:middle line:90%
You see, oh, I'm in inertia.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So if I just move
with my inertia,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.200 align:middle line:84%
if I just enter into it and
dance it and let it breathe,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:84%
then it will take me to
flowing, into my flow.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.897 align:middle line:84%
The shadow side is
nothing to avoid.

00:10:10.897 --> 00:10:12.730 align:middle line:84%
It's something we have
to deal with everyday

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.290 align:middle line:90%
in our real lives.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But it's something
to be aware of.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is to
be aware of what's

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
going on inside of yourself,
in terms of your own energy.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
Is it an up day, a down day,
a flowing day, a staccato day?

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And the rhythms
are an amazing map

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.310 align:middle line:84%
because they tell you where you
are, and where you need to be,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and how to get there.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you dance every day?

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I don't.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But I always see life
through this perspective.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.800 align:middle line:84%
If I look out the window,
am I seeing stillness?

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
Am I seeing chaos?

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm always seeing
through the perspective

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:90%
of rhythm.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like the philosophy is
that everything is energy,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and energy is motion.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And so we're living in a
very fluid energy field.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And the perspective is, and
how exactly is it moving?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
Is its flowing?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.810 align:middle line:90%
Is it staccato?

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.060 align:middle line:90%
It's like, New York is chaos.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Maui is lyrical.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Kauai is stillness.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
London is staccato.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:84%
You start to get a sense of
place as having rhythm too.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.520 align:middle line:90%
It's like everything is rhythm.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Rhythm is the mother tongue.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:90%
It's the universal language.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And all I did was see some
very powerful patterns

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:90%
that express that energy.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, at some
point, I began to see

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.830 align:middle line:84%
how those patterns
were connected

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.200 align:middle line:90%
and became a wave of energy.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And that wave of energy is a map
to the entire creative process.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Like you experience it
when you have a baby.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
You go through your flowing
contractions, your staccato

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:90%
contractions.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Then you go into the chaos
and you do your pant breath.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And then that baby
comes down and you

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.680 align:middle line:84%
go into that trance state
of lyrical, and then boom,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.720 align:middle line:90%
there's a baby.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.090 align:middle line:84%
You're in that stillness
in that ecstatic bliss.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.650 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's all about ecstasy.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And ecstasy is a timeless,
egoist state of being--

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.150 align:middle line:90%
a place of pure energy.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And the question is,
how do we get there?

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I say, how we get
there is really easy.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.430 align:middle line:84%
It's experience plus
expression equals ecstasy.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Experience, no
expression, equals ego.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, in other words,
I have an experience.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm true to it and
expressing it in the moment

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
that I'm having it, then
I'm moving toward bliss.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:10%
If I have an experience
and I go into jet lag

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:36.240 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not being true to it,
like I'm experiencing fear

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:10%
but I'm acting out bravado,
then there's a distance.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And in that distance, that's
when the ego comes up.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.400 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
enneagram kicks in.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:90%
>> This is fascinating.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And when we come back,
I want to find out

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.640 align:middle line:90%
how one finds their own rhythm.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.160 align:middle line:84%
This is Marilyn
McGuire, and you're

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:90%
watching "The Wisdom Channel."

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.553 align:middle line:84%
We're talking with
Gabrielle Roth today,

00:12:58.553 --> 00:12:59.845 align:middle line:90%
author of "Sweat Your Prayers."

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:05.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.700 align:middle line:10%
>> This is Marilyn McGuire.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:10%
And you are watching
"The Wisdom Channel."

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:10%
We are talking to
Gabrielle Roth,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:10%
author of "Sweat Your Prayers."

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:10%
And we've been talking
about the five rhythms.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.230 align:middle line:84%
And Gabrielle,
tell us, you spoke

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:84%
of a home base rhythm, a rhythm
that kind of is our very own.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:84%
How does one find that and
know which one is theirs?

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> By paying attention to
just the ordinary movements

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.900 align:middle line:84%
of your life and the ordinary
rituals of your daily life.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
One way to find it is
through the dance, of course.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
As you dance the
five rhythms, you

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:84%
begin to understand, oh, this
one is so familiar to me.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And this one is like
a foreign country.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And you get an idea from
actually doing the dance.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But then you can see your life,
like the rhythm of your speech,

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.350 align:middle line:84%
the rhythm of the way you
eat, the way you make love,

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.940 align:middle line:90%
the way you live your life.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Like when things
get too speedy, when

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.630 align:middle line:84%
things get too linear and too
staccato and too percussive,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:84%
it's like I feel
myself trailing behind.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not my rhythm.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.560 align:middle line:90%
I move in a slower pattern.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.550 align:middle line:90%
I process things deeply.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And I move in a very
circular kind of way.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.655 align:middle line:90%
I relate more to cats.

00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I've always had that kind
of laid back way about me.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And now, in fact, my
own world is so big

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.590 align:middle line:84%
and moving at such
a staccato pace,

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.450 align:middle line:84%
that I have to really
keep up with it.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.160 align:middle line:90%
My husband is more staccato.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the
difference in just the style

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.640 align:middle line:90%
of how we do things.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.340 align:middle line:84%
Like, he'll have his blue
pens all lined up on the desk.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have pens all over
the house by every phone,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.780 align:middle line:90%
in every pocket.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:05.020 align:middle line:84%
There's just a different way
about just the simple things

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.750 align:middle line:84%
that you can observe
about yourself.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
I walk into a house, and I can
see if a flowing person lives

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Because there will be lots
of couches and lots of

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
places to sit back and
be very comfortable.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Where in a staccato
house, you'll

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:22.417 align:middle line:90%
see very defined furniture.

00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything has more edges.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
In a chaotic household,
you'll see everything

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:90%
all over the place.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:29.990 align:middle line:90%
It might work.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:90%
It might not.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's like, things
are all over the place.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And in a lyrical
household, everything's

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:90%
light, airy, and pastel.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And a still household is very
zen, like a zendo, very sparse.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So you can see in your
house, in your clothing,

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.630 align:middle line:84%
in the way that you walk,
if you were the first kid

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.020 align:middle line:84%
to finish dinner at
your table or the last.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.918 align:middle line:90%


00:15:58.918 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
I remember eating dinner
with a girlfriend once.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And before I picked up
my fork, she was done.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you talk about
yourself being laid back,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.370 align:middle line:90%
the rhythm you're in.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same time,
you are totally involved

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:90%
in so many different things.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:90%
You are a theater director.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:17.750 align:middle line:90%
You're an author.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:90%
You're a teacher.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.320 align:middle line:90%
You do workshops.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:84%
You're a musician, and on and
on-- philosopher, certainly.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
about your background.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
What was it in your
life that brought you

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:90%
to where you are now?

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I was suffering, for sure.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I think so, yeah.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.440 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my teens,
I was just really--

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.290 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, disembodied
is the only word I can use.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.660 align:middle line:90%
It was like I hated my body.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I hated myself.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I was just really
destructive to myself.

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And I think through
the dance, I started

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to really enter my body.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I fell into my body
through the dance,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.990 align:middle line:84%
particularly, when I found the
more ecstatic dancing, where

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I just really dance,
dance, danced until--

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.579 align:middle line:90%
>> How you find the dancing?

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:90%
How did it come to you?

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I took dancing lessons
all the way through school.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:84%
But that was about being perfect
and doing the right thing

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.260 align:middle line:90%
and doing the right steps.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And then I would go
into my room at night

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and turn on rock and
roll as loud as possible

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and just dance until
I fell on the bed.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And there was some kind of
release in that form of dancing

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.940 align:middle line:90%
that was just magical for me.

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea I would make
a life work out of it.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.820 align:middle line:90%
But I was just being a teenager.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
But then, when I
was 16, I started

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
teaching children and seniors--

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and lots of other people
in the culture-- movement.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that a lot of people
suffered in their bodies.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people had a hard
time taking a deep breath

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.090 align:middle line:90%
or being relaxed.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:84%
And I could see the
soul when people danced.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.530 align:middle line:90%
You can just see.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:90%
You can see their joy.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything fuses.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:84%
You can see body, heart, and
mind becoming one energy field.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
can see the soul.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like, once
you start dancing,

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.295 align:middle line:84%
when you put the psyche in
motion, it heals itself.

00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that this
might have something to do with

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:90%
the dominant side of the brain?

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
For example, when we're
worrying about something,

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
or when we're trying
to do something

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
that requires our logical
and analytical side,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:36.380 align:middle line:84%
that is where we
bring in the stress.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.720 align:middle line:84%
That's where we tell
ourselves the horror stories.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But you get into the
right brain activity,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:84%
which dancing is, do
you think that might

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.030 align:middle line:90%
be related, the way this works?

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm always wanting to
know how something works.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that the
dancing is a way to access

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
the feminine part of the cells,
because it's the receptive part

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.808 align:middle line:90%
of the cells.

00:18:57.808 --> 00:18:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And the most receptive
thing that we can do

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.040 align:middle line:90%
is receive the breath.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And I say that because I go
all over the world teaching.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And in every room
that I'm in, I see

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:90%
people holding their breath.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.643 align:middle line:10%
And it's so simple
and it's so primal.

00:19:10.643 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:10%
But that's what we're doing.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:10%
And what happens when
you're holding your breath

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:10%
means that only your
head is being energized.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's where
the enneagrams come in.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Because when your head
only is energized,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
it's just that chatter,
little mind, that's going.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And all of our attention
is being sucked into it.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you start dancing, it's
like the breath will drop down

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:90%
into the heart area.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And then your chest
area is energized.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And you start experiencing
your feelings--

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.480 align:middle line:84%
your fears, your
anger, your sorrows,

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds-- your
joy, your compassion.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And then, as the breath sinks
down deeper into the belly,

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
you really start to feel your
instincts and your intuitions

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.310 align:middle line:84%
and your sensuality,
your sexuality--

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
and I say, the reason that's
why we're so afraid to breathe.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Because then we would really
be responsible for being alive,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and for being real, and
for being authentic,

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and for being
spontaneous, and for being

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:90%
full-bodied, rhythmic artists.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.350 align:middle line:90%
And that is a lot.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And so most people would
rather just play it safe

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and do the nice, normal,
neutral neurotic act

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and just take a breath
to about the neck.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.197 align:middle line:90%
And then we think we're safe.

00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:20.280 align:middle line:90%
But we're really not safe.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.197 align:middle line:90%
What are we safe from?

00:20:21.197 --> 00:20:23.090 align:middle line:90%
We're safe from life, you know?

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't work for me.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're resisting
the very force of life,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.550 align:middle line:90%
the spirit of life.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.965 align:middle line:90%
I mean, breath is spirit.

00:20:31.965 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:90%
And it is the major catalyst.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's meant to be deep in
the body, like a baby or a cat.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
The whole body should
be being breathed.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.140 align:middle line:90%
And when it is, then we're hot.

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:43.940 align:middle line:90%
We're happening.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:90%
We're juicy.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.860 align:middle line:90%
We're electrified.

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.810 align:middle line:90%
We're turned on.

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is what scares us.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we breathe
in such a shallow way.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you breathe
shallow, you live shallow.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like driving
a car around in low gear,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:90%
when you breathe like that.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You're kind of going, like,
cross-country in low gear,

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.300 align:middle line:90%
in first gear.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I know in some of the Hindu
Eastern Indian philosophies,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.410 align:middle line:84%
they measure someone's life
according to the number

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.210 align:middle line:90%
of breaths.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:18.500 align:middle line:84%
You get so many breaths
in your lifetime.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to take
as few as possible.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
hear you saying,

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:84%
that you have
discovered for yourself,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:84%
that not as many breaths
to get to the point

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
where you can breathe deeply,
and not as many times.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the whole point for
me is to get to the point where

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not in control of my breath.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not in
control of my breath.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.015 align:middle line:84%
>> You had said that
expression a minute ago.

00:21:44.015 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that I'm
receiving and letting go.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I receive my inhale and
I let go of my exhale.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.210 align:middle line:84%
That is the metaphor,
that is the dance.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And how would one begin?

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, say, I'm listening.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:59.045 align:middle line:84%
But I had such a great pleasure
listening to you sent me--

00:21:59.045 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:90%
>> "Zone Unknown."

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it was wonderful.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.560 align:middle line:90%
It was this album.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:90%
And I just turned it on.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was just doing
the supple egg bit,

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing
I knew, I'm dancing.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling better, haven't
had the coffee yet, you know?

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's it.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.950 align:middle line:90%
The beat is a great lover.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.360 align:middle line:90%
>> The beat is a great lover.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.283 align:middle line:84%
And you just
surrendered to the beat.

00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:23.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Now you composed this music.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:26.160 align:middle line:84%
You are involved
in the composition

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and selecting musicians.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:90%
How is it?

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's more like jazz.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Like, when we select
the musicians,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:90%
we put down the bottom.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we just have incredible
musicians come in and put layer

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:90%
upon layer upon layer.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.722 align:middle line:84%
And each one does
it in their own way.

00:22:39.722 --> 00:22:41.180 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't presume
to tell somebody

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.910 align:middle line:84%
how to play an instrument
they'd spent their entire life

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
learning how to play.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:50.330 align:middle line:10%
So it's more like I
kind of direct the music

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.440 align:middle line:10%
in a very poetic way, either
through my body and dancing,

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:10%
or through poetry, and
not through musical notes.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:22:59.870 align:middle line:90%
I might say, what kind of key?

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.910 align:middle line:90%
I tend to like minor keys.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But other than
that, each musician

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:84%
adds himself or herself to the
tracks, and hopefully it works.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Gabrielle, thank you so much.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Marilyn McGuire.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is "The
Wisdom Channel."

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking to Gabrielle
Roth, author of "Sweat Your

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Prayers."
