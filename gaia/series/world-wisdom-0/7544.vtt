00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Has it ever occurred to
you that you may be intuitive?

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.900 align:middle line:84%
We all are according to Dr.
Mona Lisa Schulz, author

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%
of "Awakening Intuition."

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:10%
I am Marilyn McGuire.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.460 align:middle line:10%
And you are listening
to the Wisdom Channel.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.620 align:middle line:10%
We're talking with
Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.430 align:middle line:10%
And you have written a book
called "Awakening Intuition."

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
You are a medical doctor,
and you have a PhD.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And you're talking
about intuition.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:10%
I find that very interesting.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.370 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us?

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
all of us have intuition.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:90%
It looks different.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.230 align:middle line:90%
I think it's like cars.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
We all have different
makes, models, or years.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
Our intuition is
different in the same way.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:84%
If we have a body, if we have a
brain, and you sleep at night,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:84%
last time I looked, you
have all those items.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Then by definition, you and
everyone else has intuition.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to find out
what your area of genius

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.070 align:middle line:90%
is and perfect it.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And that is how intuition
will travel through to you.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.150 align:middle line:10%
So as a physician, the first
time I got an intuition was--

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:10%
well, the definition
for intuition

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.960 align:middle line:10%
is the capacity to
make a correct decision

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.302 align:middle line:10%
with insufficient data.

00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
And you would agree with
me that most every one

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:84%
of us in our lives have to
make decisions every day

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.560 align:middle line:90%
without enough information.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was on the
floor the first day

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.303 align:middle line:84%
as a student doctor
in the hospital,

00:01:59.303 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:90%
they throw a patient at you.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:84%
They just say, Mary
Brown, she's 42.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Go down to the emergency
room and pick her up.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.627 align:middle line:90%
So that's it.

00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:84%
You obviously don't
have enough information.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way to
get enough information.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:90%
You just got to go down there.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
So being compulsive, I
have all these little books

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:90%
in my white coat.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
OK, Mary Brown,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
well, suppose she had
right upper abdominal pain.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Suppose moderately obese,
green stretch pants.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Suppose she's on her
way to a family reunion,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and she has this right
upper abdominal pain.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:90%
She thinks it's her gallbladder.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going on.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, suppose that was the case.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:90%
What would I do for her?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.582 align:middle line:84%
I look in my book, because
I'm going down the emergency

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:90%
room in this elevator.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I say, OK, I would
have to run bilirubin.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to run a right
upper quadrant ultrasound.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:90%
I'd have to do all these tests.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.480 align:middle line:10%
And I, in a way, ahead of
time, using my intuition,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:10%
I order this
patient's treatment.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
By the time I get down there, I
find out that this woman indeed

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:90%
had right upper abdominal pain.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.235 align:middle line:84%
She thought it
was a gallbladder.

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And she was on her way
to a family meeting.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.275 align:middle line:84%
I did this three times
in a row in the hospital

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:90%
as a medical student.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, oh my
god, this is amazing.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
This can help me treat
my patients better.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.335 align:middle line:10%
And it can also help me get
out of the hospital faster.

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I think this
is quite amazing.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.370 align:middle line:10%
But is this just a gift
that maybe you have,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:10%
or do you feel that others
as well have this intuition?

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And how do we tune into that?

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, in that
specific situation,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:10%
I turned around and I
learned very quickly that all

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:10%
the information in the
world couldn't help you.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.577 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I looked
around and I figured out,

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:45.160 align:middle line:84%
the people who looked
the best and did

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.380 align:middle line:84%
the best in the
hospital were the ones

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that were using your intuition.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.170 align:middle line:84%
The nurses, nurses have
an uncanny capacity

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:84%
to let you know very subtly when
a patient was going to crump.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And if you were a
doctor and you wanted

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.615 align:middle line:84%
to work with your nurses, you
would say to them, well, Mary,

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
the nurse, what's the weather
here on the unit tonight?

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.812 align:middle line:90%
Well, I don't know.

00:04:08.812 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be good.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:10%
And she would tell me
ahead of time which

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:10%
patients were going to crump.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that
other professions also

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:90%
used intuition.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.055 align:middle line:84%
There have been
many studies that

00:04:19.055 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
suggest that specific
professions, nurses,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:84%
stockbrokers, businessmen,
the best people use intuition

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.420 align:middle line:90%
to make the decisions.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>> What is a medical intuitive?

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> A medical intuitive is
a person who it's a special

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:90%
branch of intuition.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is they
usually knowing only a person's

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:84%
name and their age and
not seeing someone,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
they can understand specific
emotional situations that are

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.520 align:middle line:90%
going on in the person's life.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:90%
They can describe them.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:84%
As the way I'm a
medical intuitive,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.937 align:middle line:84%
I describe active
issues having to do

00:04:55.937 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
with what they do
for a living and how

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:90%
that can impact their health.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
I look at active issues around
relationships they're in

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:90%
or any other part of their life.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I describe
their body from head

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
to toe, each organ for the
presence of health or disease.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I do is a
medical intuitive

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.470 align:middle line:84%
is I help the client awaken
intuition in their life.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.650 align:middle line:84%
I help teach them that
specific signs and symptoms

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.220 align:middle line:84%
in certain organs
in their body are

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
related to a specific emotional
situation in their life.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:10%
And nine times out of
10, the person will say,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:10%
I knew that anyway, but I
didn't want to listen to it.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:10%
And what I say, so you
knew it intuitively?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the things in your
life as you were a growing

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.440 align:middle line:84%
young girl and growing up that
might have put you in touch

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.670 align:middle line:90%
with this intuitive feeling?

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
Were you aware of
it during your life,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:84%
or did you have an
unusual childhood?

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that with
all of us having intuition,

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:90%
how do we gain access to it?

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I think all of
us, if we're cars,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:90%
we develop a dent somewhere.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:10%
And that makes us unique.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:10%
A dent can be an illness.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.620 align:middle line:10%
It can be an emotional tragedy.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.420 align:middle line:90%
It can be anything.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And that is an event through
which intuition can come to us.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.700 align:middle line:90%
Mine happened to be health.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.710 align:middle line:84%
And the dent happened
to be in my head.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a problem that I walk
around and I fall asleep.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they call
it awakening intuition,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.032 align:middle line:90%
from my point of view.

00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:27.490 align:middle line:10%
And so what would
happen is I would

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:10%
be out for long amounts of time,
and I would, when I woke up,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.990 align:middle line:10%
have to intuit what went
on when I was asleep.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.710 align:middle line:84%
All of us have the capacity
from various events

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.390 align:middle line:84%
in their life to
get more intuitive.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Mine just happened to be
from a hole in my head

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:90%
from a sleep disorder.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You speak of a
hole in your head.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
Is it literally a
hole in your head?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Is this your dent in your car
that you gave symbolically?

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, actually, yeah.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one of the
most interesting things

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.470 align:middle line:84%
is they say the left brain
is the rational world.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And the right brain
is the intuitive world.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So you think that's
that cool stuff

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.610 align:middle line:84%
that they talk about in Omega
or Common Boundary and all

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.410 align:middle line:90%
that other stuff.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, the reality
is that's true.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Because when they get
a CAT scan of my head

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.250 align:middle line:84%
to find out what was
underneath the hood,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.810 align:middle line:84%
they found out that my left
brain is like a little nubbin.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.440 align:middle line:90%
And my right brain is huge.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:84%
They call that in neuroanatomy
reversed symmetry.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.160 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, most of
us walking around

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:90%
have the wiring for intuition.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.420 align:middle line:84%
But just due to
evolution, our left brain

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is much bigger than
our right brain.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.390 align:middle line:90%
Mine is just the reverse.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, most of the time
when I'm walking around,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.952 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a right brain state.

00:07:39.952 --> 00:07:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I can't get
out of it, which is

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
why probably I have a
more exaggerated capacity

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.730 align:middle line:90%
for intuition.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:84%
But you see all of
us have right brains.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.410 align:middle line:90%
>> We do.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes, indeed.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You just moved
your left hand.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And you got a left foot,
then you got a right brain.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a capacity
to use it for intuition.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
If your left brain
is bigger than you

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.790 align:middle line:84%
at night, if your left brain
in your head is bigger,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.520 align:middle line:84%
then you probably have
a greater capacity

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:90%
to get intuition through dreams.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to
find out who you are,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.820 align:middle line:84%
what your specific
genius is, and then

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
find out how intuition comes to
you through your basic wiring.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
did as a physician

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.980 align:middle line:90%
and as a neuroscientist.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I tried to find
out how intuition

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:31.540 align:middle line:84%
is wired in us through
disease and through health.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying is that
we look for that dent of that,

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
would we call it a flaw perhaps
in our own physical body?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have a
beautiful purple suit on.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.982 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure some
of your suits when

00:08:46.982 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
you come home, you
go, oh my god, there's

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:49.990 align:middle line:90%
a snag in the fabric.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So then you look at the
label, and the label

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.240 align:middle line:84%
says, if you find
an imperfection

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.450 align:middle line:84%
in the fabric, that's just
part of the normal character

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:90%
of the garment.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:90%
All of us have little snags.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.735 align:middle line:84%
>> But that snag is the
entry point to intuition.

00:09:05.735 --> 00:09:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly it.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And so do we try to heal
that, or do we realize that,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we don't want to get
rid of the very entry point.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But it is through
that broken place,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.650 align:middle line:84%
for example, that we
can bring intuition in.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the word healing
is the operative word.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Because there's the curing
and then there's the healing.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I study with Chris Northrup
and I do research with her.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:84%
And she really taught
me the difference.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.835 align:middle line:84%
The way that I think
of it is you know when

00:09:36.835 --> 00:09:37.960 align:middle line:90%
they put those highways in?

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> They got the big
rock in the road,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:90%
and they blast it through.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:90%
They put a hole there.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.910 align:middle line:84%
That's now an
imperfection in that rock,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's through which
information or the road

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:90%
can travel through.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Through problems in our lives,
we blast through blockages.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Could be illness.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Could be a divorce.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Could be a death in our family.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's tragedy.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:84%
The idea is to keep
that area open.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:90%
Heal it.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.705 align:middle line:84%
But then understand what
gifts can travel through

00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:09.910 align:middle line:90%
through that road.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And is this like we could
liken this to the small voice

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:90%
within in some ways?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I think, for some people,
it's the small voice within.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And then because we're
in our left brain

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.940 align:middle line:84%
or in our very noisy world,
it's the soft voice within.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But since we got the VCR,
we got the CD player,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.100 align:middle line:90%
we're in the exercise.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything's whirring.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:90%
We're at work.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.880 align:middle line:90%
Computers going like this.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Or in the hospital and all
the machines are going.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:10%
That small voice,
you can't hear.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.570 align:middle line:10%
And the first time
you don't hear it,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.033 align:middle line:10%
then it taps you louder.

00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:10%
And then you don't
hear it anymore

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:10%
because it's inconvenient.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:90%
You brush it off.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Then it's a hammer.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
listen to it again,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes the
form of a truck.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold that thought, Mona Lisa.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
This is Marilyn McGuire.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And you're watching
the Wisdom Channel.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.650 align:middle line:84%
We are here talking
to Mona Lisa Schulz.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.638 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:10:59.638 --> 00:11:10.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.210 align:middle line:10%
I am Marilyn McGuire.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:10%
And you are watching
the Wisdom Channel.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle line:10%
We are talking today to Mona
Lisa Schulz, a medical doctor

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.220 align:middle line:10%
who has just written a book
called "Awakening Intuition."

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Mona Lisa, the things
you have been telling us

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:90%
are quite fascinating.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
These are things that have
been happening to you.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time,
you're telling us

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
that we are all
intuitive and that we

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:90%
can tune into our intuition.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And you've given us ways
in which you've done that.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
What are some tips on
discovering our own intuition,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:90%
some actual tips?

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the last part of
the book shows the intuition

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.568 align:middle line:84%
network and how it's
distributed in you.

00:11:55.568 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a left brain,
if you have a right brain,

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.950 align:middle line:84%
if you have a body, you sleep
at night, each one of those

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is a part of your
intuition network.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to find
out what part of it

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.670 align:middle line:90%
you best process intuition.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
Dolly Parton said, find out who
you are and do it on purpose

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.210 align:middle line:90%
and then, I guess, embellish it.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And the key is that all of us
have innate gifts in one area.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
left brain dominant.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Through my studies
in neuropsychology

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and neuroanatomy, some people,
they're very detail oriented.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.677 align:middle line:90%
They're very language based.

00:12:30.677 --> 00:12:33.135 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that take
those courses in college where

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:35.550 align:middle line:84%
they have all the books, and
they have all the papers.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
These courses, I
avoided like the plague.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
But these people are
very left brain dominant.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Their gifts, if that's
you, you're very symbolic.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Most of your information
for intuition

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:90%
will come through your dreams.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
So you'll get to go out and
buy all those dream books

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and find out all
that symbols and find

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.792 align:middle line:84%
that your unique intuition
language through your dreams.

00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
But you'll like
that because you're

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.150 align:middle line:84%
into books and reading
and all that stuff.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:84%
However, in contrast,
if you're someone

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
who's what I would
call a spaz intuitive,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.730 align:middle line:84%
who runs around a lot has
hyperactivity and attention

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:84%
deficit disorder
kind of qualities,

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:84%
you are what I would
call a spaz intuitive.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And that means is that
most of your intuition

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
come from your right
brain and your body.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.380 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, I'm
very much like that,

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:84%
especially with my
family and my friends.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I will tend to act out
intuitively when something

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.010 align:middle line:90%
is going on in the room.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So for example, two
people were at a table.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:90%
We're having dinner.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know they're
having an affair,

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:84%
but no one else does, but
I kind of know intuitively.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.520 align:middle line:10%
I'll start playing with
a candle on the table.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'll start taking
the sugar cubes

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and putting them over the
candle and then seeing

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.640 align:middle line:90%
how close they can get.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:90%
And then they catch on fire.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's a symbol for the
fire of those people's passion

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:54.980 align:middle line:90%
in their relationship.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And then by accident,
I'll get really,

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:84%
because it's something going
on underneath the surface.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.330 align:middle line:84%
People who are spaz
intuitives, their body

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.025 align:middle line:84%
acts out intuitively what's
going on in the situation.

00:14:05.025 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing
with fire, and that's

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:08.733 align:middle line:84%
what they were doing in
their affair with each one

00:14:08.733 --> 00:14:10.080 align:middle line:90%
of their mates at the table.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
child who has that,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.820 align:middle line:84%
they might have particular
gifts in that they

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.237 align:middle line:84%
might be able to
understand what's

00:14:15.237 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
going on through their
behavior and so will you.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
Other people are
body intuitives.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
A body intuitive is a person
that will feel in their body

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:84%
somewhere when something
is going on intuitively.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.543 align:middle line:84%
Most of us have that, gut
responders, headaches.

00:14:30.543 --> 00:14:32.210 align:middle line:10%
And like in the middle
part of that book

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:37.170 align:middle line:10%
is basically a manual for what
specific symptom or illness is

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.860 align:middle line:10%
related to what your intuition
is trying to tell you.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to find out
your unique gifts and talents

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.660 align:middle line:84%
and what area of the
network is most developed

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:90%
and work with that.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And you explain this with a
chart in the back of this book.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.220 align:middle line:90%


00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.650 align:middle line:84%
How is this being
the way you are

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
and the intuitive way that
you are affected relationships

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.377 align:middle line:90%
>> That's been a problem.

00:15:08.377 --> 00:15:09.210 align:middle line:90%
That's not been fun.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are
different types.

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:90%
I mean, there are friends.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And there's family.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And then there are more
intimate relationships.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess the best way that you
can explain it is have you ever

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.940 align:middle line:90%
seen the movie "City of Angels"?

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:22.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, the "City of Angels,"
these guys are dressed in black

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:90%
and they're angels on Earth.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And they go into the
library, and they

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:90%
can hear people's thoughts.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
So when they walk
in the library,

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.753 align:middle line:84%
all these people are
reading, and they

00:15:34.753 --> 00:15:36.053 align:middle line:90%
can hear all this buzzing.

00:15:36.053 --> 00:15:37.220 align:middle line:90%
That's the way it is for me.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm an auditory intuitive
and also a visual intuitive.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So I hear people's thoughts,
which is very hard.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:84%
This weekend, I'm at a
booksellers convention.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
into a convention.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And all the things that
you hear, the buzzing,

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I hear double buzzing.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I hear what's going on in
their head at the same time.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.440 align:middle line:84%
This is particularly
problematic in relationships.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I work with friends and
we work with corporations.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.430 align:middle line:84%
If I sit at a table, and they
are telling her one thing,

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and they're lying
to her, I will hear

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.760 align:middle line:90%
what's going on in their head.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.530 align:middle line:84%
I hear two
soundtracks, the truth

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:84%
and what's coming
out of their mouth.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And what's
problematic about this

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.790 align:middle line:84%
is that I will blurt it out like
a right brained ADD intuitive.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:26.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll either spill something,
something will catch on fire,

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.290 align:middle line:84%
or I will say,
they're lying to you.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.415 align:middle line:84%
Because it's absolutely
the most distracting thing.

00:16:32.415 --> 00:16:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And the only time
that it doesn't

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
happen is when someone's telling
the truth where what's going on

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.063 align:middle line:84%
in their head and what's
coming out of their mouth

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:39.190 align:middle line:90%
is the same track.

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
It's superimposed, and I only
hear one line of language.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.760 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it makes sense.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:49.780 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it makes sense that
this is possible for you,

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.680 align:middle line:90%
that you are gifted in some way.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I feel that a lot of
people have intuition,

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and some do and
don't know they have.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:84%
But I wonder if we could
attain the level of,

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.819 align:middle line:84%
I would say levels
of consciousness

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that you seem to walk
around being able to hear

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.349 align:middle line:90%
all these conversations.

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.891 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that
I want to do that.

00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
>> I will tell you how the
level is different for different

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.347 align:middle line:90%
Let me just tell you this.

00:17:16.347 --> 00:17:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever gone and
tried to buy a house,

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
and someone's saying, oh,
the roof is wonderful.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.530 align:middle line:84%
This roof will
last you 15 years.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You might not hear two
different soundtracks,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.540 align:middle line:84%
but your stomach is
starting to retch.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.040 align:middle line:90%
You don't know.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Guy looks nice.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.840 align:middle line:90%
He seems honest.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.840 align:middle line:90%
But why is your flesh crawling?

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.240 align:middle line:10%
You have what we call the
positive flesh crawling sign.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.513 align:middle line:84%
So you might not
hear two tracks,

00:17:39.513 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:90%
but you're a body intuitive.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.670 align:middle line:90%
You'll hear it in your body.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I guess the real question
is how to get someone

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.930 align:middle line:84%
to perfect their intuition and
not put it in the place of,

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.000 align:middle line:90%
she can do this.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you a
story that hopefully

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:90%
won't make your flesh crawl.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And that was this woman,
this lady calls me up.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
She's doing a TV program.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And she says, the question
that I usually hear,

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:84%
which is, can you do
a reading on the air?

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.528 align:middle line:90%
And that misses the boat.

00:18:07.528 --> 00:18:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I've done it once,
and it's accurate,

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.112 align:middle line:90%
but that's not the point.

00:18:10.112 --> 00:18:12.430 align:middle line:84%
The point is to how to
get you to understand

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
how intuition is wired in
you and do it on purpose.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:10%
So I said to her, no, if
I do a reading for you,

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:10%
that won't be the point.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:10%
And I told her some other
readings that I had done.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:10%
Over the course of this
phone conversation,

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.080 align:middle line:10%
her voice got more
hoarse and hoarse.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:10%
Her voice sounded like
this, very much in pain.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:10%
She sounded like
she was in agony.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.102 align:middle line:10%
And this conversation
was terminated by her,

00:18:36.102 --> 00:18:37.810 align:middle line:10%
and she said, I got
to get off the phone.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.482 align:middle line:10%
This is awful.

00:18:39.482 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:10%
And so she got off the phone.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.468 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, wow,
what a wonderful thing.

00:18:43.468 --> 00:18:45.010 align:middle line:10%
Can't she just figure
out another way

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.230 align:middle line:10%
of terminating it rather
than feigning this illness.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:10%
She tells me she's going to
call me back the next day.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.230 align:middle line:10%
The next day she calls me.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:10%
Her voice is completely normal.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:10%
And what does she tell me?

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.480 align:middle line:10%
She tells me the
most amazing story.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.150 align:middle line:10%
She says, Mona Lisa, from
the moment I got on the phone

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:10%
with you, my neck
starts hurting me.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.120 align:middle line:10%
It got tighter and tighter
and tighter and tighter.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.448 align:middle line:10%
And it was so painful
that it affected my voice.

00:19:06.448 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And she says, I got
to tell you, when

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I got off the phone
with you, it went away.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:84%
She said, I've never had
problems with my neck before.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So she said, I had
to think about this.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
I get on the phone with you,
and my neck starts hurting.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I get off the phone with
you, and my neck goes away.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.670 align:middle line:10%
Do you have neck
problems, Mona Lisa?

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do I
have neck problems?

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And I said, see, well,
she's on the phone,

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.000 align:middle line:90%
so can't see the scar.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:90%
But see this scar?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.420 align:middle line:10%
I've blown four
disks in my neck.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:10%
She went, oh my god.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:10%
And she said, I've never
felt anything like that.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt in my body what
was going on in yours.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.840 align:middle line:10%
And I said, and now you have
something for your show.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:10%
You're a body intuitive.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.290 align:middle line:10%
You experience in your body what
can go on in someone else's.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:10%
And I said, you're like a lot
of mothers who can experience

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.930 align:middle line:10%
what's going on in
their kid's body,

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:10%
or you're a lot like twins that
can experience what's going

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:10%
on in their twin's.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.650 align:middle line:10%
Once she knew she could do
that, she actually came to Maine

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:58.980 align:middle line:10%
and stayed way away
from me, I guess,

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:10%
because she didn't
want to have neck pain.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:10%
But you see, the idea
is to find out how

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:10%
you do that through practice.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:10%
There's ways of
practicing in the book.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.420 align:middle line:10%
There's various exercises.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.320 align:middle line:10%
But it is possible to do it.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.580 align:middle line:10%
You just have to take the
risk and not feel foolish.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and these are like
the gut reactions or different

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.370 align:middle line:90%
reactions in parts of our body.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Does this relate at all to the
receptor cells for thoughts,

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:90%
the work of Candace Pert?

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fabulous.

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:10%
I read an article that was in
Intuition Magazine about her

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:10%
because I heard about her work.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.740 align:middle line:90%
And I actually read a lot.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:84%
She talks about a
psychosomatic network.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.763 align:middle line:84%
What's fascinating is
exactly that two people who

00:20:45.763 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
work in completely
different areas

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:84%
can come up with the
same information,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and that is the most
fascinating thing.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.420 align:middle line:10%
A lot of us work in
mind body medicine.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Joan Borysenko does her thing.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:90%
She works in Harvard.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.980 align:middle line:90%
I slice brains for a living.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Chris Northrup
works in the pelvis.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Caroline Miss works
with archetypes,

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so on.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.900 align:middle line:10%
And what's fascinating
is that we can all

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.928 align:middle line:10%
end up intersecting and
explaining the same phenomena

00:21:08.928 --> 00:21:10.220 align:middle line:10%
from a different point of view.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Through different
points of view.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:10%
>> And why that is so beautiful
from a scientific point of view

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:10%
is the following.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful to sit in a lab.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm a scientist.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
I have all these
published papers.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.660 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to sit in a
lab and discover something.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:90%
That's fabulous.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:25.760 align:middle line:90%
You feel so great.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:84%
Then you go to the conference
and you present it.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And you publish the paper, and
you get something on your CV.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:84%
The best part is not that is
that someone else can then

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.040 align:middle line:90%
reproduce it.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.610 align:middle line:84%
If no one else can
reproduce your data,

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.440 align:middle line:84%
then you're messed up
because someone else

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
has to show you that that
phenomena also exists.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.190 align:middle line:10%
That Candace Pert can
work in a lab in NIH

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.740 align:middle line:10%
and talk about
molecules of emotion,

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:54.220 align:middle line:10%
and then I can go through
the literature for a decade

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:10%
and show that how certain
emotions are laid down

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:10%
in certain organs of the
body, I was euphoric.

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.290 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was absolutely
fascinating because we

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:90%
can footnote each other.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.440 align:middle line:90%
And that's how science works.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.870 align:middle line:90%
Everyone makes observations.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.348 align:middle line:84%
And then we find
a new phenomena.

00:22:10.348 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that happened
with the AIDS virus.

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:15.140 align:middle line:84%
Two people, two separate
maps worked on the AIDS virus

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
at the same time and
discovered it simultaneously.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.930 align:middle line:84%
What is that guy's name,
"New Science of Life"?

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Rupert Sheldrake.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.553 align:middle line:90%
>> Rupert Sheldrake.

00:22:24.553 --> 00:22:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Talks about the
100 monkey theory.

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.470 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Guy over in Guam, OK,
teaches a rat how to swim,

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.680 align:middle line:90%
goes in circles.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.560 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, the rats in
China are swimming in circles.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.620 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like all these
wonderfully brilliant people

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.780 align:middle line:84%
are working on the same
thing, and they all

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:90%
discover it at once.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Mona Lisa, you're a
very fascinating person.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And the work you're doing
is certainly fascinating

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.300 align:middle line:90%
and will help us all grow.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:90%
I am Marilyn McGuire.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have been watching
the Wisdom Channel.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.750 align:middle line:10%
We've been talking
to Dr. Mona Lisa

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:10%
Schulz on "Awakening
Intuition," which

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.810 align:middle line:10%
is the title of her new book.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for joining us.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.560 align:middle line:90%
