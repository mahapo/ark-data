00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:10%
>> What would you need to read
a book that is sitting unopened

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.900 align:middle line:10%
in a distant library, or to tell
your friend what is happening

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:10%
within his or her body, or
to remember beyond this life?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Edgar Cayce has
been able to enter

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:84%
a super state of
consciousness of infinite

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
knowing, and claiming
no speciality.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But he said it's something
that we could do ourselves.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
My guest today examines
revelations of Cayce readings

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
about the hidden
powers of the mind.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to share with
you how this knowledge can

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.400 align:middle line:90%
play into your everyday life.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:84%
A psychologist, a
researcher, and author--

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:90%
welcome, Dr. Henry Reed.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being with us.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you, Carolyn.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And the book, in particular,
one of the probably most moving

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
books, where you have done a lot
of research on the Edgar Cayce

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.670 align:middle line:84%
readings, is your
book, "Your Mind--

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Unlocking Your Hidden Powers."

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Even though Edgar Cayce said
that we could all do this,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:84%
how difficult is it for us to
even begin to unlock the hidden

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.390 align:middle line:90%
powers of our own mind?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, for example,
we all, most of us,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:10%
drive to work every day.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.680 align:middle line:10%
And for many minutes
during that trip,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:10%
we're not paying
attention to the driving.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.430 align:middle line:10%
We're thinking about
something else.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:10%
And yet we manage
to get there safely.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.100 align:middle line:10%
So who's driving the car?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, isn't that amazing, a
power of the mind right there?

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
But he did say that we
have the same capabilities.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.900 align:middle line:90%
Where do we begin?

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think we can begin
where our interests are,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:10%
what we value most in our life--
our relationships, our jobs,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:10%
our hobbies--

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.259 align:middle line:10%
to bring that little extra to
it, that extra bit of caring

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.718 align:middle line:10%
and creativity.

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there were
so many dimensions

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:90%
to what he was talking about.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
It's more a matter, I
guess, of personal taste.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.030 align:middle line:84%
You do a lot of work with Edgar
Cayce's work on dream analysis

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.812 align:middle line:90%
or understanding.

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little
bit about the work

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.353 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing in the
world, in your workshops,

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:29.100 align:middle line:90%
with dream understanding.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, he said that we were
capable of getting guidance,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.830 align:middle line:10%
that we weren't restricted to
book-learning, for example,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:10%
in our powers of understanding,
and that guidance could come

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.670 align:middle line:10%
to us through dreams, through
daydreams, through hunches,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.200 align:middle line:10%
intuitions.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've been exploring all
of those particular realms

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
to find ways that people
can tap into that guidance

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.847 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:02:52.847 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There are all kinds of
different dreams that we have.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:84%
I think we were
talking about earlier,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
some people call
the pizza dreams.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But you say that there is
no, just, dream of the day,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.697 align:middle line:84%
that every dream that we have
can possibly give us a gift.

00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It certainly can.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.655 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell, necessarily,
the value of the dream

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.280 align:middle line:90%
from its surface appearance.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:10%
Although for most
of us, we're going

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.970 align:middle line:10%
to find some dreams give
their gifts right away

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.770 align:middle line:10%
and other dreams
take so long to work

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:10%
with that for all
practical purposes,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:10%
perhaps they're unlockable.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
But many dreams that
people throw away

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:84%
do have some particular
value or meaning.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you pay attention
to your dreams as a child?

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I had some favorite dreams.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.160 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite ones
was directing an orchestra.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And we were making up
the music as we played.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't figure out
how the musicians managed

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
to know what I was making up and
play the song right out there

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.130 align:middle line:84%
in front of me as
I would direct it.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What did that
come to mean for you?

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:90%
Or was it--

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just a mystery.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:90%
It was magical, you know?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And just, I don't
know what I did

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
with it as a kid besides just
marvel at how it was possible.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.600 align:middle line:90%
The same with flying--

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.140 align:middle line:84%
flying in the dream and
then get out in the morning

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and maybe climb up on the roof
and stand there and think,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.000 align:middle line:90%
should I jump?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:90%
Should I try it?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.365 align:middle line:84%
It seemed real at night,
but now I don't know.

00:04:13.365 --> 00:04:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it
seems to me you--

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.980 align:middle line:84%
just telling me that story,
it seems to me that that is

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.779 align:middle line:84%
the way that you seem
to greet life, too.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that?

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's magical.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's informative.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.340 align:middle line:90%
It's inspirational.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:90%
It's got revelation for you.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It certainly is.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I guess maybe that's
why I'm a researcher

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.260 align:middle line:84%
and following my curiosity
and willing to try things--

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Curious George type of person.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I was told by someone else
who does great work in dream

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
understanding and development
that the dreams that we have

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.780 align:middle line:84%
as children, the ones
that we remember,

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
have a profound insight to the
way we go about living our life

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.780 align:middle line:84%
or the perspective from
which we live our life.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Have you found that true?

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I certainly found
that true in my case.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've done
experiments asking people

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.170 align:middle line:84%
to remember their
favorite fairy tale.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And that memory
or that choice is

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
very indicative of
their style of living

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.400 align:middle line:84%
or a certain aspect
of their story

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.580 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be
very important to them.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it have something
to do with their healing,

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.010 align:middle line:90%
or their potential, or both?

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Healing, their potential,
challenges that they have

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:90%
to face.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:10%
For example, in the
directing the orchestra,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:10%
there was a picture of
an improvisational kind

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.360 align:middle line:10%
of a situation involving
me and other people.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And yet at the
same time, there's

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.150 align:middle line:90%
this music was evolving.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And this proved to be a
particular skill that I had

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.510 align:middle line:84%
of taking a group of people--
we have a general idea of what

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:90%
we want to have happen.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how we're
going to get there

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:90%
and we have to play it by ear.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.766 align:middle line:90%
And yet, things come out.

00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Great-- a lot of
improvisation in my own life,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:84%
whether it's an improvisational
theater or exploration,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.253 align:middle line:84%
and working in a lot
of different ways.

00:06:08.253 --> 00:06:10.170 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there are a lot
of things that you do

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.018 align:middle line:10%
in your workshops and working
with people in their dreams

00:06:13.018 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:10%
and understanding their dreams.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are people
that say they don't dream.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And you've said,
well, there's a way

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
to know what your dreams
are, that we're all dreaming.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:84%
But there's one
thing in particular

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
that you have done, that
you shared earlier--

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
the ceremonial group, where the
group comes together and helps

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
awaken their own
dream awareness.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you give us
an idea about that?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things that
I was concerned with was that

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.590 align:middle line:84%
the science of dreams was
becoming too mechanical.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:84%
They looked at dreams as being
somehow like an egg factory.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And if they pushed
the right buttons

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.885 align:middle line:84%
and pulled the
right levers, they

00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:50.100 align:middle line:84%
could make dreams
come out at will.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And that just didn't
seem right to me,

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.290 align:middle line:84%
and that some of the
special qualities of dreams,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.910 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to have
something maybe

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
on the order of a
ritual, something

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
that would really
engage people's

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.330 align:middle line:90%
deep level of interest.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And Edgar Cayce had said
that we would never really

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
be able to understand the
deeper powers of dreams

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.850 align:middle line:84%
unless we created
experiments that really

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:90%
evoked people's soul desire.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was just not
going on in the laboratory.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.840 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to take dreams
out of the laboratory

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and put them in a
different context.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And not too far from here,
the Edgar Cayce Foundation

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.480 align:middle line:90%
had a camp for children.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
So as result of some
dreams that I had,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I erected a tent by
the creek down there.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And I had the kids sleep in the
tent to have special dreams.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And I would let them
get objects from nature

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
and decorate the tent and make
it into a special sanctuary.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:10%
And they'd spend
the day in prayer.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And we would come
and work together

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
in making up stories and skits
about their problems and issues

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.093 align:middle line:84%
that they wanted help
from God in their dreams.

00:07:53.093 --> 00:07:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Then they would
sleep in this tent

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:90%
to have this special dream.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And they would really have
some very interesting dreams

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
while they were
sleeping in that tent.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.080 align:middle line:84%
And that is one story in
itself about special dreaming.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.730 align:middle line:90%
But they were in a community.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.270 align:middle line:10%
They weren't all by themselves.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:10%
They were at camp.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:10%
And other kids knew that they
were sleeping in that tent.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.560 align:middle line:84%
And other kids would be curious
about what was going on.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
Other kids would come and
tell me about the dreams

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that they had while Johnny
was sleeping in the tent.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.990 align:middle line:90%
>> You said you have--

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:84%
part of your workshop
is a ceremony

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.028 align:middle line:84%
where people come together
to dream for someone else.

00:08:26.028 --> 00:08:26.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:26.828 --> 00:08:29.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it started,
because of kids telling

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
me the dreams that they
had about other kids who

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:84%
were off having their special,
we call them, the dream visions

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:90%
or the dream tent dreams.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So on the basis of that,
we started a process

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.240 align:middle line:84%
to see if people could
do it on purpose.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So you get a group
of people together

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:84%
and let one person volunteer
who had some kind of a problem

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.260 align:middle line:90%
or dilemma.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:84%
And without saying what it
was, to ask the group for help.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.870 align:middle line:10%
And the group would,
we would promise

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:10%
to dream for that
person that night.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we would go
to sleep not knowing

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.340 align:middle line:84%
what the person's question is,
but having made that promise.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We better not forget
our dreams, because we

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.498 align:middle line:84%
had said we would deliver them
to that person the next day.

00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing was,
we'd come back in the morning,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
and most people
would have dreams,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.940 align:middle line:84%
but most people would
believe that their dreams had

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
nothing to do with that
person and their problem.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.130 align:middle line:84%
But in a few minutes of
discussing the dreams

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what
they had in common,

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
we could easily come
to a guess about

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
what was bothering that
person, and probably

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle line:90%
what they should do about it.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
And in some 25 years
of doing that kind

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
of a ceremony and people doing
it in their homes and so on,

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.980 align:middle line:84%
we found that invariably, we're
very helpful with those dreams.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:90%
And everybody is surprised.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The person who's
dreamed for just

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
can't believe that all these
dreams were speaking so

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
intimately about
their situation,

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
bringing up feelings
that they hardly

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:84%
knew that they had until they
were voiced in someone else's

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:90%
dreams.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the dreamers being very
surprised that they could come

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.390 align:middle line:84%
up with dreams when
they didn't even

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:90%
know the person's question.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very special
and incredible way

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.020 align:middle line:84%
of demonstrating
to anybody who is

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.000 align:middle line:84%
willing to make the
effort that they

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
can, with the aid of their
dreams, see around corners.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Why is it that we tend to,
or there are those that tend

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.070 align:middle line:84%
to pay no attention
to the dreams,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:84%

the dreams valuable?

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to
those individuals?

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.700 align:middle line:84%
How do you offer to them
some of the benefits

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:90%
of looking at their dreams?

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it depends on
their motivation, I suppose.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Are you motivated to know
about the value of dreams?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Are you motivated to
stay in your position

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.110 align:middle line:84%
that dreams are
not worth anything?

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.660 align:middle line:84%
So the person has
to care, you know?

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.890 align:middle line:84%
They have to want to
make that discovery.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.330 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some
of the benefits?

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it's good to start
some kind of a project,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:10%
something that they care
about in their life.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.620 align:middle line:10%
That's where to begin.

you, where would you

like their help to be?

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.600 align:middle line:84%
And then start
working in that area

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
yourself, doing your best to
improve that area of your life.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Turn it into a project, and
then expect that your dreams

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.250 align:middle line:90%
would help you in some way.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:84%

cultures and some tribes that

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.370 align:middle line:84%
come together and believe that
first thing in the morning,

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.740 align:middle line:84%
that is the reality of your day,
is to get together and share

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.850 align:middle line:84%
and discuss what you have
dreamed in the night.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.330 align:middle line:84%

>> Yeah.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:90%

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.930 align:middle line:90%
it's just not our reality.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course, makes it
very difficult for a family

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.730 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate an appreciation
for dreams, if it's going

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:90%
to be at the breakfast table.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.730 align:middle line:84%

we can ask ourselves about

our dreams to engage more
awareness and more remembrance.

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.970 align:middle line:84%

journal or a piece of paper

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.550 align:middle line:84%

to spend the time
writing you down.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.820 align:middle line:84%
You could think about
them during the day.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
One game I'd have people
play is sometime after lunch,

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself, what did
you dream this morning?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:90%
What did you write down?

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And lots of times,
you can't remember

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:90%
what you wrote that morning.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.060 align:middle line:84%
We had talked about a pre-sleep
suggestion during our break.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Is that sort of a subliminal way
to ignite our dream awareness

from our dreams?

>> I think you have to
understand from the larger

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.120 align:middle line:10%
perspective that Edgar Cayce
gave, that the dream is,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:10%

remnants of an experience,

we're sleeping, we awaken,

self, and that the soul has

experiences during the night.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences have
repercussions for our day,

whether or not we remember any
of that in the form of a dream.

Going after dreams
per se is really going

after kind of like the
tail of the phenomenon,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.470 align:middle line:84%
because we can, for example,
as we go to sleep at night,

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:84%
we can, say, pray
that during the night,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.080 align:middle line:84%
our soul will have
the experiences

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that we need in order to
advance our cause in whatever

situation.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%

problems with her husband
and lack of communication.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And when she went
to sleep at night,

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:84%
she would pray that
while they slept,

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:84%
their soul would communicate
about this situation.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And just to keep doing that each
night and expecting that one

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
day, down the road, they would
find themselves spontaneously

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:90%
in communication.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And with regard to
another aspect of that,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:84%
I asked her to pray
that during the night,

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:35.090 align:middle line:84%
her soul really help her release
a certain resentment that she

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.100 align:middle line:90%
couldn't consciously let go of.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.950 align:middle line:84%
But could she have
the experiences that

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:42.075 align:middle line:90%
would enable her to do that?

00:14:42.075 --> 00:14:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, she might not
have any dreams

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:84%
that she could hold onto to
give her the evidence that this

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.560 align:middle line:90%
was happening.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
But if her intent
was sincere, that she

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:84%
would be prepared to have
the conversation when

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.290 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity seemed to
happen, then during the nights,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.940 align:middle line:84%
she could expect that
healing to take place.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.520 align:middle line:84%
>> It sounds like, too, that
perhaps our nighttime world is

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.150 align:middle line:90%
the true reality.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a lot of
people believe that.

00:15:15.975 --> 00:15:20.110 align:middle line:84%
It gets to be pretty
abstract type of thinking.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But I guess it's
useful for some people

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.350 align:middle line:84%
to explore that
kind of thinking,

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that consciousness
or the mind comes first,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and matter, or
materialization, comes second.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:84%
You think that everything we
see around us in the world

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
was first in
somebody's imagination

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
before it was
literally the case,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
so that the mind or dreams
or the consciousness

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.340 align:middle line:84%
is somehow the driving force
behind what we see out there

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Can we not also,
in our dream world,

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.310 align:middle line:84%
we could be reliving something,
experiencing something,

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.912 align:middle line:84%
feeling something,
predicting something,

00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:07.120 align:middle line:90%
having insights to something.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Could we not have all these
things going on at one time

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:90%
within one dream?

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, certainly.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
We can be reliving a situation
that we still have not

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:84%
resolved that's kind of like a
sliver in our soul, as it were.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
We could be recalling
other experiences

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
that we have that are trying
to inspire us as to ways

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:90%
to get past that.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
We could be receiving
telepathic encouragement

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
from other souls around who are
trying to help us make progress

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:90%
with that.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you--

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Lots of things could happen.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> --record your
dreams every night?

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you keep up with
it every night now?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.073 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't remember my
dreams every morning,

00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
but every time I remember one,
I certainly write it down.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>> You write it down.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And then spend some time
with it during the day.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is something that
we can all develop in our own

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.829 align:middle line:84%
life, a way to tap into that
inner world that's going

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
on at night and help
us the next day.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:90%
Certainly.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it about Edgar
Cayce that drew you early on?

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
And what is it about Edgar
Cayce's work that continues

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.720 align:middle line:90%
to touch your life now?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that the
first thing, of course,

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
that got my curiosity up was
he said that we could learn how

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:90%
to interpret our own dreams.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:84%
And at the time I heard that,
and as a psychology student,

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
that was not part
of our teaching.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Dream interpretation
was for experts.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Another part of his teaching
that got me early on

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:84%
was that we could get the
guidance from dreams, which is

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:90%
what we've been talking about.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Then what got me involved
with the organization was

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I was developing a certain
philosophy about research,

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
which corresponded with
something that he had said,

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
in terms of trying to
help people do their best,

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.770 align:middle line:84%
like as in going to
the moon, as it were,

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:84%
and studying psychology
in that sense,

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.680 align:middle line:84%
rather than treating people
like rats or machines.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
inspiring to me.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I think that it was
his general philosophy that

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.840 align:middle line:84%
came forth from him, this
larger world view, which

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.905 align:middle line:84%
I subsequently had encountered
in the psychology of Carl

00:18:20.905 --> 00:18:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Jung and others, about the
expansiveness of the mind

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness, and how
to use that to further soul

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:90%
development and soul growth.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> He really stressed
that the mind--

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:84%
everything was a reflection
of where our mind is.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.080 align:middle line:84%
How has that touched
your life, that

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:90%
understanding that we are mind?

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one way it has is that
the various frustrations that

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.330 align:middle line:84%
I've encountered in life, to
try to treat them as a dream,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that somehow this situation that
frustrates me is somehow trying

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to show me something
about myself,

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.970 align:middle line:84%
so that I can reach in there
and make contact with that part

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.930 align:middle line:84%
of myself and heal it, so that
I can grow to a larger self.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.467 align:middle line:10%
>> And this is one of his, you
might say, favorite attitudes.

00:19:16.467 --> 00:19:17.925 align:middle line:84%
A person would come
with a problem.

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:20.092 align:middle line:84%
And he'd say, well, thank
goodness for your problem,

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
teach you how to grow.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You had also mentioned
earlier, I know,

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:84%
in our conversation,
I think at lunchtime,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.900 align:middle line:90%
about belief and expectation.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:84%
You touch on that
in your book, too,

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that belief and expectations can
have a powerful effect on us.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, beliefs,
expectations, theories,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
all of these things shape
the way we look at things.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.880 align:middle line:84%
They shape what
we're willing to try,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:54.100 align:middle line:84%
what we're willing to hope for,
what we'll place no bets on.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of, you could
either say limit or direct

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:90%
our attention and our energies.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So with a belief, there
is always an expectation?

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:90%
>> I suppose.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Those are just two words
having to do with the patterns

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.430 align:middle line:90%
that you harbor within yourself.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And those patterns tend to
then find their reflection

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:90%
in the outer world.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So a belief and a pattern are
probably pretty much the same

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:90%
thing, then?

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Is that is that
what I'm hearing?

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what you're hearing
is I don't really carve out too

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.170 align:middle line:84%
closely the difference
between words.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
But we'll try to think
about real-life situations

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:90%
and try to understand.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.270 align:middle line:90%
And maybe pattern is a more--

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
pattern of experience
is a more general word

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:84%
to describe expectations,
beliefs, theories,

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:90%
understandings.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And should we get rid of our--

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> In dreams, for example, one
symbol that comes up for this

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:90%
is shoes--

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:84%
what kind of shoes
you're wearing,

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.820 align:middle line:84%
the shoes you're looking for--
because the kind of shoes

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:84%
we have on affect
how we make progress

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.900 align:middle line:84%
through the environment
that we're in.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And we're often
looking for shoes

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:84%
that will both fit the
situation and fit ourselves.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's like a
pattern of understanding.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.780 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Are we a mixture of all of
our beliefs and expectations?

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Are these things that
change every day?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it something--

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me tell you this.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Take away all your experiences
and what do you have left?

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Not much.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
So we are the sum total
of our experiences.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And maybe all of the experiences
are not from this life.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:39.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've understood and
been told that we really

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.590 align:middle line:90%
need to let go of our beliefs.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us to do
that to stay in the moment

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and be present in the
moment, to not be attached.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's certainly true.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
Uh-huh.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:90%
That's certainly true.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.370 align:middle line:84%
If we had more time, it would be
very interesting to talk about,

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
how do you go back and
forth between dropping

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.910 align:middle line:84%
all of your beliefs
and being open

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
to the creative new moment,
and at the same time,

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.090 align:middle line:84%
shaping your expectations
and beliefs to create

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:90%
a perfect life?

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And where is your notion of
perfection going to come from?

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And would you be open to
a new one down the road?

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're going to
close this time together.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:90%
And you are a light.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I told you,
I had read this one book--

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:84%
"Your Mind-- Unlocking
Your Hidden Powers,"

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and then "Awakening
Your Psychic Powers."

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.950 align:middle line:90%
And I kept writing questions.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And you've got so
much to offer us.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.780 align:middle line:84%
I hope you will come
back and share with us.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And especially with
respect to the dream work.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.845 align:middle line:84%
I have learned a great
deal, and I have grown.

00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for being

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.210 align:middle line:90%

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you for joining
