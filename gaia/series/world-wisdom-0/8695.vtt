00:00:05.456 --> 00:01:05.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You are in for
a blessing today.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.270 align:middle line:84%
As you grow in self-awareness
and become more informed

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
by life's challenges, you
will treasure spending time

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.540 align:middle line:90%
with my guest.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.810 align:middle line:90%
She is a light.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
She is dedicated to the positive
aspects of healing and helping

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:84%
millions and being the best
in body, mind, and spirit.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Hi, I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to a
"World Of Wisdom."

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Linda MacKenzie is an active
holistic health practitioner

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and teacher of
alternative awareness.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
She is hosting her
own radio show,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:84%
"Creative Help In Spirit," and
we're thankful to have her.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Linda.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:44.690 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
>> What I didn't add was you're
into over 10 million homes,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:90%
I think, with the radio show.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:84%
But before this even got
started, you were an engineer.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And probably one of the most
fascinating things about you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that you bring
that engineering background,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and then you became
God-based psychic.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.360 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, boy, it was an
amazing journey, actually.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.390 align:middle line:84%
What happened was I saw God
when I was eight years old.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a lot
of different kinds

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
of psychic experiences
up to that point.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.860 align:middle line:84%
What happened then
was at about 23,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.410 align:middle line:90%
God said, well, stop this now.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:90%
And so I said, OK.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that I
would be an engineer.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So I was one of the first women
data communications engineers

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.630 align:middle line:90%
in the airline industry.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And I designed satellite
systems and air-to-ground radio

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:90%
and whatever.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And I did that for
about 18 years.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And then about three years ago,
God said, time to shift again.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:90%
And he said, let's go.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And one thing led to
another, and I resurfaced

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.560 align:middle line:90%
with my psychic abilities.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been
blossoming since then.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think
we're finding that some

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:90%
of the greatest healers now.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Healers in all aspects are
receiving a lot of their wisdom

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.640 align:middle line:90%
through divine appointment.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It's not like they're going
to a college or a university

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.810 align:middle line:90%
to gain this knowledge.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:90%
I find it interesting, though.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
It seems like the
engineering is left brain,

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.130 align:middle line:90%
as I'm always joking about.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And then, the intuitive, the
psychic is back over here

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.560 align:middle line:90%
on this other side.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, actually, I think--

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.717 align:middle line:84%
and this is the word
according to Linda, which

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:39.020 align:middle line:90%
may mean absolutely nothing--

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.071 align:middle line:84%
but I think that the psychic
ability is somewhere between.

00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
See, I believe that we use
10% part of our brains.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we learn to balance the
left side with the right side,

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
that we create an
access or a pathway

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:90%
to the 90% part of the brain.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's where psychic ability
comes from, and self-healing.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
interesting story.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
In 1987, I had the
chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.530 align:middle line:90%
or Epstein-Barr virus.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And after five months of
hectic search by the doctors,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:84%
from brain tumors to whatever,
they told me what I had.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And they told me to go home.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.130 align:middle line:90%
And there was no help with that.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.730 align:middle line:84%
And so through hypnosis
and nutrition and vitamins

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.970 align:middle line:90%
and herbs, I've healed myself.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've been sickness
free since 1992.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You think that launched
what you're doing now?

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it did.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.830 align:middle line:84%
Because also, one of the
things that God wanted me to do

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
was to tell people that
there is hope in life,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that we must face our fears, and
for me to give out information.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So everything I do in
this life from now on

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.940 align:middle line:84%
is to give out information
in truth and integrity.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> You have such a personal
relationship with God.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to
those people that

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:90%
are seeking the same thing?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Look to your heart.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:90%
Trust in your heart.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:90%
And know that he's there.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's very
simple, actually.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Surrender.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:90%
In every aspect of your life--

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
body, mind, spirit,
emotional, mental,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:90%
whatever you want to do.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
If you surrender and
know that God is there,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.680 align:middle line:84%
he'll be there
100% at all times.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:84%
>> And surrendering takes
different shapes, doesn't it?

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And different times.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm still in the path of
surrendering, you know.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.715 align:middle line:84%
It's part of the growth
and the change process.

00:05:43.715 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:90%
And it gets tough.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.175 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you surrender, and
sometimes, it hits you again,

00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:51.800 align:middle line:84%
and you gotta learn
to surrender again.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But don't we learn every
time that we do surrender?

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.740 align:middle line:90%
And I know it's true surrender.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.530 align:middle line:84%
It's truly being in a
place of not knowing

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
what the next step is, and not
relying on just the intellect

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.670 align:middle line:84%
or experience to
show you the way.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.060 align:middle line:84%
But really trusting that
there can be a paradigm shift.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to be
changed and rearranged

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:90%
to do things differently.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:90%
That's a true surrender.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
another key point

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
is when we want to be on
our path, whichever that is.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be something great,

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.770 align:middle line:84%
because if we're
contributing to society

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.100 align:middle line:84%
and helping people,
however small,

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
we're doing what
we're meant to do.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But some of the tricks of
it is to live in the moment.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Remember, if we
live in the past,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
it stops us from
healing, even healing,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.750 align:middle line:84%
because illness is
associated with remembering--

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, illness is
associated with forgetting,

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and health is associated with
remembering in the brain.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
I am going for my PhD in
clinical hypnotherapy.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
So if I talk a lot about
the left and right brain,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:90%
this is where that comes from.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to
live in the moment.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Forget the past,
because it's over.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
And the future has
so many variables.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So if we live in the moment,
we can enjoy each moment

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
as it unfolds, like
a petal of a flower.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And we can use all our senses
and taste, and and enjoy it

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:84%
for what it is,
or learn from it.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What is forgetting the past?

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
What does that look like,
or what does it feel like?

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.755 align:middle line:84%
How can I experience
forgetting the past?

00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a good question,
because I think it's different

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:90%
for everyone.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.140 align:middle line:90%
And everyone is different.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:90%
The way we heal is different.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Our spirits are different.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:90%
Our minds are different.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And so we really need
to acknowledge that.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
So the feeling of letting
go of the past is, to me--

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.630 align:middle line:90%
I can speak in my context--

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:84%
it's like having a
breath of fresh air

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that everything
around you is in focus.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:84%
You can taste and touch
and smell and just live it.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a fulfilling feeling, like
a feeling part in your heart

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:90%
and your body and your mind.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and if I have
forgotten something,

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:84%
or really released it-- and
when I think of forgetting,

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I think of not entertaining
those thoughts about the past

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that create any sort of blocks
for us, being in the moment,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:90%
or going forward.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.799 align:middle line:84%
But then, I'm in a position or a
relationship or re-enter family

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:90%
situations or whatever.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think that I
have let that go.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.929 align:middle line:90%
And I find out that I haven't.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Because if you look at it,
there's another little piece

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.950 align:middle line:84%
that you have to
acknowledge first.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So before we let
anything go, we need

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.460 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge that it's
there, that it exists.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:90%
Then we can let it go.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And my big words on all my
tapes is to feel trust and know.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And in your
engineering background,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:84%
I know you were quite popular,
but there are a lot of people

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:84%
that still know you
from that reputation.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.780 align:middle line:84%
Was it a subtle shift,
or was it a major?

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a major.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And they pulled me kicking
and screaming into this.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:90%
Because, well, my girlfriend--

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.030 align:middle line:90%
God as well.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.060 align:middle line:84%
But my girlfriend
is an astrologer.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:90%
And she did my chart.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And she said, you need
to be doing readings.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:90%
You need to be out there.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just said, well,
I'm not sure about this.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I helped
all the way through.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.383 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't quite sure.

00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And so she says, well,
I'm sending you people.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And people started
calling me from England.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I manufactured
110 products

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:84%
in alternative
medicine and awareness

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.070 align:middle line:84%
to give out information
in a positive light,

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate fear
of something new.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the only constant
in life is change.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I seem to be changing
every day into something.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always doing the
thing that I'm supposed to do.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And I trust that.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.390 align:middle line:84%
So I started out with
manufacturing some products.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I went and had
manufactured some tapes.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:90%
And they were all on healing.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And I started going on radio
and did this as guest spots.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And I went for my clinical
hypnotherapy degree.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:90%
And they heard on the tapes.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And they said I had
combined the top three

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.190 align:middle line:84%
methods in hypnotherapy
innately on the tapes.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Naturally?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Naturally, just, you know.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they went ahead and
put me in their PhD program.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.000 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.410 align:middle line:90%
And then I went into radio.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:90%
And I started my own show.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And we've been on the
air now for about--

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
oh, about a year and
a couple of months.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>> --been very successful.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I have helped over 1,066
people in a year in one hour

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:90%
on a Sunday.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.260 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to help
one person a day.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very ecstatic
about all this.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel or think that
other people can learn to be

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:84%
psychics, or can learn
to be more psychic?

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And they also need to
trust their own selves

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:90%
and their own heart.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Because there is a
lot of different ways

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.600 align:middle line:84%
to get to God, which is really
what being psychic is about.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes some of the scary
stuff away from it when you say

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:35.017 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And I am a God-based psychic.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.900 align:middle line:90%


00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:90%
And I'm right there.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:90%
And he's with me.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:90%
And I talk to him.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.300 align:middle line:90%
And he guides me.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:90%
And I trust him.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot
of peace from that.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And this way, I get to help
other people all of the time.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So in someone trusting
their heart that helps in order

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
to develop their own psychic
awareness or their channels

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.330 align:middle line:90%
to receive information--

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.730 align:middle line:84%
and I use the word
channel lightly--

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
but receive
information from God?

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:08.683 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:90%
And there's a knowing.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Now, everyone has this knowing.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And everybody has
the concept of truth.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Whether we choose
to use it or not

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
is, again, up to
that individual.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.020 align:middle line:90%
Because God is very good.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.880 align:middle line:84%
He gives us the methods and
ways to control our own lives.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.630 align:middle line:90%
We control our own lives.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.655 align:middle line:84%
However, if we do
make a mistake--

00:12:30.655 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
where there is no
mistakes, by the way,

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.430 align:middle line:84%
because it's only a path to take
a look at what we've done so we

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:90%
can progress to our next step--

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
but say, we decide that
we've taken a wrong path.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get to
relive it over and over

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and over again, as if you're
picking the wrong man all

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.430 align:middle line:90%
You'll get him again and again.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Because he'll give you lots
of opportunities to learn.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It's good to hear too, when
you were saying earlier about

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.930 align:middle line:84%
the surrender, that
there are plateaus.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And we might go back
into a situation

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.520 align:middle line:84%
and still have a feeling
or experience that we

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:90%
haven't forgotten or let it go.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.152 align:middle line:84%
But just to know that we
haven't lost ground in any way.

00:13:11.152 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:90%
We're going to be right back.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:84%
I do want to let
our viewers know

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.780 align:middle line:84%
that you have a
book called "Inner

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Insights, The Book
of Charts" by Linda

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:84%
MacKenzie, alternative medicine
and awareness quick reference

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:90%
chart.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
be talking more

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.060 align:middle line:90%
about this when we come back.

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.152 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:13:26.152 --> 00:13:29.526 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:29.526 --> 00:13:30.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome back to
"A World Of Wisdom."

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm speaking with
Linda MacKenzie.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:10%
She's the author of "Inner
Insights, The Book of Charts."

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And a wonderful question
is to know why you wrote

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:90%
the book in the first place.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty thorough.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, no one had a reference
book on alternative medicine

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:90%
and awareness.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what we want to
do is educate people

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and eliminate fear.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:84%
The only constant thing
in life is change.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:03.550 align:middle line:84%
And so to effect
positive ways to change,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to give people
alternate methods

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at,
rather than just some

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
of the standards that don't
seem to be working quite as

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:90%
well anymore.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.292 align:middle line:84%
>> It takes a lot of the
scare out, too, the book does,

00:14:13.292 --> 00:14:15.180 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of different terms.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.890 align:middle line:10%
>> But it's very easy
because what I've designed is

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.900 align:middle line:10%
a reference book that has 78
quick reference charts on 40

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.330 align:middle line:10%
different topics, from
acupressure to Western

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.330 align:middle line:10%
elements.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So if someone wanted to know
something about aromatherapy

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.993 align:middle line:84%
or Bach Flowers or
numerology or astrology,

00:14:33.993 --> 00:14:36.160 align:middle line:84%
or what Native American
animals mean in your dreams,

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.080 align:middle line:84%
or kabbalah, it's
all in one book.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And so what it does is it
allows people to figure out

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
what they would like
to be interested in,

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.450 align:middle line:84%
go out and buy more
books on the subject.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they're done, they can
go ahead and use my book again

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
as a quick reference
chart again.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I think this also speaks
to your earlier statement that

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.690 align:middle line:84%
they're all different
paths, I mean,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.880 align:middle line:90%
different ways to get to God.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, Linda, you've
talked about God as a him.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:90%
Why is that so for you?

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've also heard
mother, father, god.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, I know, I know.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, as you know
that I believe,

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is that there are many
paths to get to God.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And in my vision,
growing up as a Catholic.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw God when
I was eight years old,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.220 align:middle line:84%
he manifested
himself in my vision.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was a man with the
white beard and whatever.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And so whenever I am blessed
to be in the presence of God--

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.170 align:middle line:84%
which isn't often,
he's pretty busy,

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:84%
yet he's there for each
one of us at all times--

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:90%
he's always in this man.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
Or, I see his robe, or
his foot, or wherever

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:49.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm supposed to be at the time.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that God
will manifest himself

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.920 align:middle line:90%
to you as you perceive him.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.330 align:middle line:10%
Because perception is a
very big thing in life.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:03.770 align:middle line:84%
When I do healing or psychic
readings, you know, I'll say,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.050 align:middle line:84%
the our father,
which is my standard.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.460 align:middle line:90%
And I get my ego out of the way.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.930 align:middle line:90%
And then I kind of feel.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm a clear sentient.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.800 align:middle line:84%
There's many different
kinds of psychics.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Clear sentient, what is that?

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I probably
pronounced it wrong.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I know I did.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.633 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, being born in New
York and living in California

00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:22.800 align:middle line:84%
and traveling the world,
we never know how I'm going

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.633 align:middle line:90%
to pronounce things.

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
What is a clear sentient,
I feel what you're feeling.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And everyone is
comprised of energy.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's that engineering
mind as well as the right brain

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:90%
creative side of me.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.440 align:middle line:90%
We're all comprised of energy.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
It's either electromagnetic
or electrical energy.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle line:90%
And everything has energy--

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.510 align:middle line:84%
trees and flowers
and everything.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, as we
are using this energy,

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:90%
I go into your energy path.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.735 align:middle line:84%
And the way I do it is
like a cellular telephone.

00:17:00.735 --> 00:17:02.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the best way
to describe it.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the
signal, but I'm there.

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:05.940 align:middle line:90%
And I kind of go in, and I feel.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a sense, a knowing.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And then whoever is connected
to you, there's a cord of energy

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
to that person, or people that
are coming into your life,

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.827 align:middle line:90%
there's energy.

00:17:18.827 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not doubting.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that's true,
but I've heard that.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what I do is it's like
microseconds or milliseconds.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.248 align:middle line:90%
And I'm over in their path.

00:17:27.248 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I can sense what
they're feeling.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> There isn't a sense
of time, though, is it?

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>> No, time is.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:90%
Time is human.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It is, though.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.840 align:middle line:90%
>> God doesn't have time, yes.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.945 align:middle line:84%
And most psychics, when
you're talking to them,

00:17:41.945 --> 00:17:43.320 align:middle line:84%
if they're giving
you a time, you

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.737 align:middle line:84%
have to give them
a little leeway.

00:17:44.737 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in a space or a
realm where time is irrelevant.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there-- and I'm
going to use this word,

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and I don't even
like to use it, but--

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
good and bad, or good
and not-so-good psychics?

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not asking you to make
any judgment on someone else.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:90%
But in general?

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, most of the readings
that I do are for other

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:90%
psychics.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:10%
That was very amazing to me.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And part of my
venue is to get them

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to their next step,
wherever it may be.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the difference.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
are intuitive that

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.870 align:middle line:90%
are calling themselves psychic.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It's too different.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.713 align:middle line:90%
>> And the difference is?

00:18:21.713 --> 00:18:23.880 align:middle line:84%
>> The difference is, is
that when you get a psychic

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:84%
feeling-- first off,
to reach the levels,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.990 align:middle line:84%
you have to be on a personal
growth path to be able

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.770 align:middle line:84%
to accept the power and the
responsibilities of this.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:39.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a very hard job,
because you can not interfere

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
with that person's life path.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.263 align:middle line:90%
You need to give them.

00:18:43.263 --> 00:18:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm a little
different kind of psychic.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.160 align:middle line:90%
I tell them, don't call me back.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you the tools
to empower yourself.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.997 align:middle line:90%
Because what better way?

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And then once they
empower themselves,

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:90%
they help other people.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So I'm a little different
than most psychics.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's a
physical manifestation

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.580 align:middle line:84%
when you're having a
psychic experience in lieu

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:90%
of a intuitive experience.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.573 align:middle line:84%
For me, the small of
my back gets numb.

00:19:10.573 --> 00:19:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Other people, their
stomach may flutter,

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.907 align:middle line:84%
or their eyelids may
flutter, or they'll

00:19:13.907 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:90%
get a sensation in their hands.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know at that point,
you are connected with this

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.690 align:middle line:90%
other individual or--

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --with God.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:84%
And God is doing, or
with whatever he's chosen

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.417 align:middle line:90%
to provide for me at that time.

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes,
it's not, you know?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:90%
It's the path.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:90%
He'll let me do it on my own.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So how is this different,
then, from intuition?

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Intuition can only go so far.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:39.930 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's intuitive.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Everyone has hunches.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's psychic.

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in the world
has psychic abilities.

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:84%
And you stockbroker will
tell you that all the time.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> So would you see yourself--

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not touting you or
patronizing you in a way, but--

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.320 align:middle line:84%
would you see yourself
among the many

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and yet-- compared to the
whole population-- the few that

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:84%
might be showing us some
examples of how we can find

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.340 align:middle line:90%
that ability within ourselves?

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.830 align:middle line:10%
>> What seems to be happening
with my life is that whoever

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.650 align:middle line:10%
needs me comes.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.180 align:middle line:90%
So I don't question.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't put myself
on any kind of level.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I just am who I am.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:90%
And everyone has value.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The power of the
thought, I think,

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:84%
it's the most powerful thing
that we can begin to understand

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.130 align:middle line:90%
in our waking state.

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And as our human
being evolving state,

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
it is one of the
most powerful things.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know,
every day I work

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:84%
with this, what's happening
in my thoughts right now.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:90%
What am I manifesting?

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the things that you

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.730 align:middle line:84%
can say to us about getting
a grip on those things that

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.012 align:middle line:84%
are going through our
heads at all times?

00:20:59.012 --> 00:21:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have a
little exercise I give.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot
of stress in the world.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's all sorts
of stress, you know?

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
There's emotional electrical
stress from the wires,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:90%
and environmental stress.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's nutritional stress
when we don't get our vitamins.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And this stress makes
our power of thought

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.510 align:middle line:84%
erratic because we're
getting hit on all sides.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very hard today
in all walks of life, you know?

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.760 align:middle line:90%
It's just very, very tough.

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is
say, take a minute

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:90%
and get rid of the stress.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:37.415 align:middle line:84%
And how you do that is you say
to yourself, I've got a minute.

00:21:37.415 --> 00:21:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to give myself
a break in one minute.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to allow
all the emotions

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:44.260 align:middle line:90%
to come out and process.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that minute,
I am going to be centered.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be whole.

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to be at peace.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And you close your eyes, and
you take a look at the clock

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:84%
before you close your
eyes at the time.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:90%
And you close your eyes.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:22:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And I see fantastic colors
when I get emotional,

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.330 align:middle line:84%
because I'm processing
emotion all the time.

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll see all this red light
and different colors, you know?

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:09.820 align:middle line:90%
And so, it's an amazing thing.

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And then that will get me back
to center and back to peace.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.210 align:middle line:84%
There's another way to do that
is to think of your stomach

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.450 align:middle line:90%
chakra.

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Think of your stomach
so that it centers you.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's all sorts
of little tricks.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of my
thing, is to give it.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And my radio show does this.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.740 align:middle line:84%
We do nothing but short
stuff on information,

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.070 align:middle line:90%
alternative medicine awareness.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Let's learn it.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.080 align:middle line:84%
>> We're glad to have you
on "Wisdom Radio" too.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to have
to close this time.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.455 align:middle line:84%
And we will have another
segment with you.

00:22:43.455 --> 00:22:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the meantime, I want
to let our viewers know

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.090 align:middle line:84%
about the "Inner Insights,
The Book of Charts"

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
by Linda MacKenzie,
alternative medicine

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.805 align:middle line:84%
and awareness quick
reference charts.

00:22:52.805 --> 00:22:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're going to be
seeing a little bit of this

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:90%
during the break.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
