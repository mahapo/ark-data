00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to "The
World of Wisdom."

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:10%
My name is Linda
Rachel, and today we

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:10%
are exploring the
world of wisdom

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
with a wonderful author and
lecturer, renowned speaker who

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:10%
talks to people about
the importance of having

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:10%
vision and living from
vision, Ilona Selke.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Ilona, thank you for joining us.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you, Linda.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Today I'd like to talk to you
a little bit about the Living

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:84%
From Vision course, and also
to talk to you about some

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.290 align:middle line:84%
of the wonderful
adventures that you've had.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:10%
Your life is such a
storybook of adventures,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:10%
as you've done
research with dolphins

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.450 align:middle line:10%
and have used that
information to help humankind.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
It sounds that you have done
a wonderful work already

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:90%
with your life.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I feel the same way.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:90%
I feel very lucky.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.690 align:middle line:10%
What I discovered is that--
when I was studying philosophy

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:10%
is that the answers
don't necessarily

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:10%
lie in the rational mind.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:10%
We can discuss ourselves
silly about what is truth,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.060 align:middle line:10%
and where is it, and is
there anything such as truth.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.616 align:middle line:90%
But the truth lies within.

00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we are
looking for truth,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
sometimes we are always
looking outside of ourselves

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.020 align:middle line:84%
or to someone else to give
us the truth, or to a book,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:90%
or to a lecture.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.580 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying that much
of that wisdom is within us?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
A person, a book, a
lecturer, a teacher

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
can help us discover ways
of accessing inner wisdom.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:90%
I can teach tools.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I like
the most is seeing

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that when people have used
the tools, they get results.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I, with my partner,
Dan Paris, developed courses,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:90%
and we teach seminars.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And amongst them, we co-created
some with Dr. Rod Newton

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
called The Living
From Vision Course.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
It gives tools, but
the wisdom is within.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you read a great book
that's uplifting and tells you,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:84%
look at beauty around you, like
the "Celestine Prophecies,"

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.340 align:middle line:84%
or like I write about in
my book of be grateful--

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:84%
think of three things that
you're grateful for every night

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:90%
you go to sleep.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:84%
That's actually one of the
exercises in the Living

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.710 align:middle line:90%
From Vision class.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:84%
If alone you do
that every night,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.370 align:middle line:90%
you already feel much better.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdom is
something that's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:90%
different for each person.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We're not all the same in terms
of ability on this planet.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are in
the first grade.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:90%
Some of us are graduating.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Some of us have a doctorate.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And depending on where our level
is, it's perfectly all right.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in the view of
the one, the creator,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.570 align:middle line:84%
there isn't really a
difference in value.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:10%
In your book, "Journey to
the Center of Creation,"

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.420 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to quote something
that you had in there

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:10%
I thought was very interesting.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.630 align:middle line:84%
You said, we are creating our
own realities all the time,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
consciously or
unconsciously, and we

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
can learn to become increasingly
a mirror of beauty and of love.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And it also says that we are
angels in training on Earth.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:90%
I really liked that.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Angels in training is
truly what I believe we are.

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.750 align:middle line:84%
If we don't think we're
an angel in training,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.690 align:middle line:84%
we at least know that we're
here to better ourselves

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:90%
in some way.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:90%
Are you honest?

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Are you honest when a clerk
under-charges you by $100?

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.620 align:middle line:84%
They may have to pay
that out of their pocket.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.360 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to be
honest down to $10?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:90%
How about down to $1?

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.530 align:middle line:84%
It's those little virtues that
we develop our ability to love,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
to care for another,
to develop compassion,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
to develop listening
to that inner nudge

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.060 align:middle line:90%
more and more often.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
That's what I call
the angel in training.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And if being an angel is
too far-fetched for you,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.520 align:middle line:84%
then you can be a
human in training,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.830 align:middle line:90%
a great human in training.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I remember how I learned
my inner voice listening is

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.450 align:middle line:90%
through cooking rice.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
I boiled rice, and then
suddenly, I got this feeling.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%
The rice is done.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.720 align:middle line:90%
You better go check now.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And invariably, the rice
was done right then.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And if I had waited longer,
it would have gotten burned.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So I learned to listen
to that inner voice.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and I learned to check whether
it was right on or not.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And in the courses
that we teach,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:84%
we teach methods on how to
access that inner voice,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.160 align:middle line:90%
how to learn to listen to it.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:90%
Because it's good.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.387 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
hear that voice?

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't hear a thing.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a skill.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It's just like a
skill like anything,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.480 align:middle line:84%
like playing on computer
games with computer games,

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or writing on a computer,
or playing piano.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:90%
We can develop our inner skills.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And you are a musician
as well as an author.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And through music, many times we
explore and can express things

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
that we feel inside
that we couldn't express

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.120 align:middle line:90%
with words particularly.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So do you think that also
this inner voice that we have,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's the composer
within us, whether it's music

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
or it's intuitive
thoughts that are coming?

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Do you think maybe we've blocked
some of these inner voices,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and that's why we
don't hear them?

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that concept.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for
asking that question.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I do really believe that our
culture in the Western world

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:84%
has done everything
to squelch that voice.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Children are taught
not to visualize, not

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.790 align:middle line:84%
to daydream because we know
that the only world out there

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:90%
is the three-dimensional world.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And granted, we build nice
houses with that ability.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
We're very good calculators, and
we get spaceships to the moon.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.650 align:middle line:84%
But what it doesn't teach us is
how to truly love and connect

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:84%
with another and how to make
our magical dreams come true.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have heard that--

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:90%
we know about virtual reality.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And kids are really involved
in that sort of thing.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.480 align:middle line:10%
They've even discussed having
virtual reality theme parks,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:10%
like with dolphins,
or that they're

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.780 align:middle line:10%
living in this world
which seems imaginary,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.860 align:middle line:10%
but yet it's not connected
to self in some way.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel about that?

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It addresses the basic
need of our brain to be active

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
inwardly.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:84%
People watch TV all the time to
supply the brain with images.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.010 align:middle line:84%
If we go to a theme park, what
we're going to experience,

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
even if we have the most
sophisticated product,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
is a hookup that simulates to
our brain only on five senses,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:90%
only to our five senses.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.560 align:middle line:84%
A virtual reality experience
cannot address the higher

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
senses, the sixth
sense or the intuition.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:84%
If I am in a theme
park making love

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.760 align:middle line:84%
with this imaginary
partner I might

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.430 align:middle line:84%
make up all to my
own liking, I'm

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.240 align:middle line:84%
going to only
experience the input

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:90%
that my body would receive.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe my brain would kick
out certain chemicals,

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:84%
but I would not feel the
love and the connectedness.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I've
developed in teaching--

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and some of it is on connecting
with other people in the higher

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:90%
dimensions--

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.450 align:middle line:84%
is that when we
do that, we truly

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
feel like we're more nourished
than when we actually

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.110 align:middle line:84%
have physical sensations
such as pleasure.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, combine the two,
and you've got a winner.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, in a virtual
reality experience,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:84%
even if it is with a
dolphin or another human,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.220 align:middle line:84%
if we get a
five-dimensional input,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:84%
our kids are going to learn
that our reality exists out

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
of five dimensions and five
senses only, three dimensions.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.530 align:middle line:84%
What we fail to
teach our children,

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:84%
which all the old cultures
have always taught,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
is that the truth is the
90% that you can't see.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It's the telepathy.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the traveling
into other places

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.880 align:middle line:84%
where, if you make a change at
the blueprint level of reality,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.440 align:middle line:84%
you will see changes
in the physical world.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
But if we as humans
don't learn to travel

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.650 align:middle line:84%
to the fifth dimension,
to the blueprint level,

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
we will only be as effective
as our body can be.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.140 align:middle line:90%
We can have machinery.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.410 align:middle line:84%
We can have a very powerful
effect on the physical world

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
in a very limited space.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But we can not
reach the creation.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to tell you a story
on that that is very magical.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.120 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Almost unbelievable.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
But it explains how creating a
change in that blueprint level

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.910 align:middle line:90%
makes the physical world change.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.770 align:middle line:84%
My partner and I were
driving in Germany

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.580 align:middle line:84%
riding on the train, ready
to see a friend in Stuttgart.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And he is a musician as well,
and a classical musician.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Had a rehearsal that day.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.635 align:middle line:84%
And all I knew was a time
and a place to meet him.

00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have his address.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:90%
He was just moving.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have a phone number.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:90%
We had made out a time to meet.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.820 align:middle line:84%
By the time we left,
our train had delayed.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.870 align:middle line:84%
In Germany, trains
always are on time.

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't calculate
that at all.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
By the time we'd
reached halfway point,

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.720 align:middle line:84%
all the clocks at
the railway station

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:84%
pointed the delay out
to me ever so clearly.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And I got frustrated.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:90%
I got very anxious.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.830 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't going to meet
my friend that I hadn't seen

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
for a year at this place under
the big clock in Stuttgart,

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:90%
we weren't going to meet him.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.665 align:middle line:84%
He had an hour time
period to meet with us,

00:10:45.665 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and then he was going
to show us where to go.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:90%
So I'm sitting in the train.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I'm very angry
with the situation.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm very frustrated.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, you know,
that Living From Vision course,

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.680 align:middle line:84%
there is this part
in there that's

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:90%
called Learning From Problems.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I should just use that.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So I communicated with
that feeling of anger.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:84%
You know how we usually
have that in our stomach?

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I took it out, imagined
it as a red fireball.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, what
do you really want?

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, first it said,
well, I'll make sure

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.480 align:middle line:90%
that everything works right.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, what I really
want is I want to be on time

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and meet our friend.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, that's great.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:90%
How would that look like?

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the next step
you're supposed to say.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And it said, well,
it would be great.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
We'd be having fireworks,
seeing each other.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I felt the firework, I
saw the firework, and I said,

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.440 align:middle line:90%
thank you, dear red fireball.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate your help.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Let's ask you to
become this new image.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.470 align:middle line:90%
And so it's helpful.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.887 align:middle line:84%
It says, sure,
that's what I want.

00:11:46.887 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I'll become that image anytime.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:84%
So we take the old
energy after being

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:84%
grateful for trying to create
a result for me that I really

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:90%
wanted.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the image
fulfilled-- fireworks

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:90%
of meeting our friend.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And we sit in
there, and the clock

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.580 align:middle line:90%
keeps showing that we're late.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And as we arrive, we're on a
different caye, and we get off.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:90%
We walk to the big clock.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Don looks around and says,
well, maybe he's here.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.570 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he waited.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, our
friend says, Don, Ilona!

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:90%
How did you make it early?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the big
clock, and my jaw dropped.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.730 align:middle line:84%
We have come 15 minutes early
despite all the clocks showing

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle line:90%
me that we were late.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.640 align:middle line:90%
It was in the month of August.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have summer--

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.200 align:middle line:90%
the daylight saving time yet.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.540 align:middle line:90%
And we had a miracle.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.532 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a miracle.

00:12:40.532 --> 00:12:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We'll be right back and talk
to you a little bit more

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
about miracles in our lives
and the reality of them.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:52.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.310 align:middle line:10%
I'm Linda Rachel, and this
is the "World of Wisdom."

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:58.520 align:middle line:10%
Today we have as, our
special guest, Ilona--

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.190 align:middle line:10%
author, musician, visionary.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And she's here to tell us about
some of the wonderful things

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
that she's learned about
envisioning peace and joy

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and love among the
hearts of the human race.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Ilona
Selke, for joining us.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much for having us.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like for us to explore
maybe some ways of showing

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:84%
people how this visionary
technique and imaging can

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:84%
really help them in
their everyday lives,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.030 align:middle line:84%
especially with
their own problems.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:36.260 align:middle line:84%
I can think of a problem
that I experienced

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.450 align:middle line:84%
that had to do with
a mother and a child.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It happened to be my
sister and my niece.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.250 align:middle line:10%
We were visiting in Germany,
and we were on vacation.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:10%
One morning she woke up terribly
disturbed, very withdrawn,

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't talk.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.740 align:middle line:84%
We couldn't figure
out what was wrong.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know what was wrong.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
She wouldn't come and sit
with us to eat breakfast.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.260 align:middle line:90%
She was refusing.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.480 align:middle line:84%
We were ready to go sled
riding in the mountains.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.790 align:middle line:90%
This was in Austria in the Alps.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:90%
And she was just out of it.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So she was hiding behind
the curtain by the window,

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
wrapping herself in the cloth,
and just refusing to talk,

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
just even letting us
know what was wrong.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So I came up to her, and
I remembered the processes

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that we teach ourselves, the
Living From Vision processes.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.260 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, if I can
communicate with her

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:10%
in some ways, maybe I can help
her deal with whatever feeling

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.330 align:middle line:10%
she has, whatever blockage
or frustration she has.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
My sister, on the other hand, at
first was going, talk with us,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.730 align:middle line:90%
sit down, do this, do that.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.130 align:middle line:84%
But that wasn't
getting her anywhere.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So I came up to
her, and I said--

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
I imitated her body
language, which

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:90%
is a form of making a rapport.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:90%
So I played shy.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Finally I found out that
she'd had a bad dream,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:90%
and she dreamed of a monster.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And the monster scared her.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And she was going--
her parents were going

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.080 align:middle line:90%
through a divorce at the time.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
So here was this
child in divorce

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:84%
situation, terrified
of a monster

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:90%
that was going come and eat her.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And she wasn't that age.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.080 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, how
big is that monster?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And I had her do that
visualization process,

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.640 align:middle line:84%
the same one I did with
a miracle about time

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.610 align:middle line:84%
jumping with the train
ride, had her visualize it

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:84%
outside of herself,
which gives her a chance

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.230 align:middle line:84%
to be separate from
the feeling, but she

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
can communicate with it.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So then when she
communicated with it,

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
it told her that it wanted to
make sure that she was safe.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.310 align:middle line:84%
The deepest intent
of that monster

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
was to make sure
she was powerful.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Of course it wanted
to at first just

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:90%
devour her and be powerful.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The way it looked is like,
what do you want, monster?

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to eat everybody
up and just be really big.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.903 align:middle line:84%
And what do you
really want, monster?

00:15:49.903 --> 00:15:51.320 align:middle line:84%
And the monster
said, well, I want

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.260 align:middle line:84%
to be really big, I want
to really be powerful,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.330 align:middle line:84%
which was her part that
wanted to really feel

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.688 align:middle line:90%
empowered in this situation.

00:15:58.688 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:84%
So I said, how would that
look like if you were already

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:90%
really powerful?

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well,
I'd be-- and she'd

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:10.010 align:middle line:84%
make up this super powerful
luminous angel image.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And we said, well, can
you thank your monster

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.870 align:middle line:84%
for really wanting to
make you this powerful?

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.240 align:middle line:84%
And we had the monster
become part of the angel,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.850 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the monster
really wanted to become,

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:90%
is very powerful.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.360 align:middle line:84%
So now she had this big,
luminous angel there,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.730 align:middle line:84%
this part of herself
externalized in an image.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And so we had her
continue talking

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
with it in a couple
more steps, like does it

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:90%
have a task for you?

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Does it want you
to do something?

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the angel gave
her specific ideas

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.600 align:middle line:84%
of what the angel
wanted her to do.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And she came out of herself
feeling this radiance of being

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.300 align:middle line:90%
this powerful being herself.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.235 align:middle line:84%
Because it is part of
her own mind, right?

00:16:50.235 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So she sat down at
the breakfast table,

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.170 align:middle line:84%
and we went on sled riding
through the mountains

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Alps.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And it was a beautiful
day, and she felt glowing.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And that same day, I had
her sit quietly by a stream

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and say, now, if you could
imagine that this dream had

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:08.780 align:middle line:84%
a voice, and if you
could feel like you

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:12.369 align:middle line:84%
were one with this stream,
what would this stream say?

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.119 align:middle line:84%
And she closed her
eyes, and she listened.

00:17:14.119 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it said not to
throw garbage in the stream.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:84%
That's the power
of our intuition.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And children are so
much closer still.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And if we can encourage
that with them, we

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.350 align:middle line:84%
can help them through problems,
help them become more powerful.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.280 align:middle line:90%
I teach it in Germany.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.960 align:middle line:84%
We have quotes from
children in Germany

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:84%
who have these imaginary beings,
Einstein and fairies, that

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
tell them answers
to school problems.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I've written a children's book
where one of the children that

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
wrote me a letter said,
I get grades of A.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
All I do is visualize that
I'm getting a 1-- in Germany,

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.520 align:middle line:90%
it's an A--

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and I have this
imaginary, wise being

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:55.377 align:middle line:90%
that tells me the answers.

00:17:55.377 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And I don't feel afraid
in front of tests anymore,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:90%
and I get these great grades.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much
for writing your book.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of times, we do
feel alone with our problems--

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and not just children,
but adults as well.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying
is that if we can

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:90%
take a problem, for example--

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:18.700 align:middle line:84%
and we have the expression then
we'll say it's eating at us.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It's like we've internalized
it, and it stays within us.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.730 align:middle line:10%
And you're saying, if we
can imagine that problem

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:10%
outside of ourself, even
in the form of some image,

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:10%
that we are able to
work through what it is.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:90%
What is the bottom of this?

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Why is it feeling this way?

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.910 align:middle line:90%
And it separates from us.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And being unattached, we
are able to deal with it.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the course,
Living From Vision,

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.253 align:middle line:84%
we have various tools of
how to address problems.

00:18:50.253 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways,
like you said, is

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
talk to them, like the
proverbial pain in the neck,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
or the frog in the throat,
or the pressure on the chest,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.510 align:middle line:90%
or the clamp down feelings.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Those are all feelings that
we usually try to push away,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.550 align:middle line:84%
even when we are
in a relationship.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And if we bring them out,
communicate with them,

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and we can get to the
bottom of it, we discover.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And this is the gift that I
find we can discover as humans--

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.320 align:middle line:84%
is that everything, no matter
how negative it appears,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.570 align:middle line:90%
has a positive intent.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> So even a pain or
a problem, in ways,

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
is an opportunity for
experiencing life more fully?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> By going through it.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, by communicating
with it and saying,

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.080 align:middle line:90%
what did you really want?

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And what you do is
really, you jump time.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.403 align:middle line:84%
Normally we would
get there eventually.

00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:42.070 align:middle line:84%
But this way, you
say, how would it look

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:90%
like if you were already there?

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And that is the particular
method of manifesting dreams.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.500 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel like, and
what image would represent

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:90%
that feeling fulfilled?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.180 align:middle line:84%
It usually is a symbolic
image, like a rainbow,

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:03.490 align:middle line:84%
jumping person, butterflies,
a flower, a sunflower,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:07.990 align:middle line:84%
whatever it may be, an image
that represents the feeling

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:90%
fulfilled.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And you have to go within
and listen to that feeling.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.490 align:middle line:84%
How would a wonderful
relationship with my spouse

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:90%
feel like?

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And I may get this
glowing feeling of warmth

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:84%
in my heart imagining
the very thing I want.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And my image for
that may be a fire

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.400 align:middle line:84%
in the stove that I'm
watching, or a glowing sunset,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
or palms blowing in the
breeze, two together.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And that image represents
my feeling fulfilled.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:84%
And if I can hold that, I can
create the reality I want.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:84%
The course, Living From
Vision, is about that.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It is also about learning
to create imaginary advisors

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.480 align:middle line:90%
and listen to them.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I have advisors for
eating the right food.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
A leaf of salad tells
me, no, Ilona, I

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.740 align:middle line:84%
don't think you better
not order this one.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.030 align:middle line:84%
I think this one
looks really good.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.285 align:middle line:90%
Or an advisor--

00:21:04.285 --> 00:21:07.953 align:middle line:84%
>> So these are inner voices
that you pay attention to.

00:21:07.953 --> 00:21:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're saying
that we all have

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.990 align:middle line:90%
these inner voices within us?

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And I would go as far as to
say that we not only have

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:84%
these voices within us, but
that they are dimensional,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.750 align:middle line:90%
other dimensional helpers.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:27.700 align:middle line:84%
At times if I imagine-- if I
put a face to an archangel,

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael,
and I say, what

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:33.480 align:middle line:84%
is it that I need to learn,
it's a different answer

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.950 align:middle line:84%
than if I say, salad leaf, what
do you think I need to eat?

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.190 align:middle line:84%
It could be explained away
as simply a representation

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
of a higher knowledge
that's hidden within me.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But I truly believe
that we actually

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
have a world that
is almost vaster,

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
way faster than
our physical world.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is tapping
that dimension that we

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:84%
need to learn as people
in the Western world.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If you could just tell me,
maybe in a sentence or two,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
what your message would be to
the world of how it is that we

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.260 align:middle line:84%
can see into the hearts
and souls of each other,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:90%
what would it be?

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Wake up to the dimension
beyond the physical world

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and listen to your
inner higher self,

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.620 align:middle line:84%
to the guidance that is
beyond your higher self,

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
which eventually leads us
home to the source, to God,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:90%
like you just put it.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.190 align:middle line:90%
We've just begun to tap things.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very much for
coming in and joining us.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:90%
