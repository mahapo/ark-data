>> A world of wisdom awaits you.

You never know who
you're going to see

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.100 align:middle line:10%
or what you're going
to find from feng

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.610 align:middle line:10%
shui, self-empowerment,
meditation, yoga, interviews

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:10%
with leaders and teachers in
the vast human potential field,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:10%
plus special news
breaking moments,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:10%
and words of inspiration.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:84%
On the cutting edge of the
move to a more positive,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:84%
harmonious world is the "World
of Wisdom," a variety program

dedicated solely to the mind,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:90%
body, spirit connection.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.130 align:middle line:84%
The growth in human potential
happening all over the world

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is not our destination,
but it is our journey.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Tune in and join us for
a "World of Wisdom,"

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.630 align:middle line:84%
variety in a new way
on the wisdom channel.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:10%
>> For 24 years, the world
has become a better place

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:10%
because of one man and one
woman and their program,

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:10%
which is called New
Dimensions Radio.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Michael and Justine Toms
have started and completed

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.155 align:middle line:90%
24 years of being on the air.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Their program is now on 250
stations in the United States,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.490 align:middle line:84%
on shortwave around the world,
and even on the Army stations.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:84%
They have blanketed the
world with their message

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.150 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality and
hope and science.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.980 align:middle line:84%
We are very pleased
on the Wisdom Channel

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:90%
to welcome them today.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And first, I'd like you to
meet Justine, Justine Toms.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so nice to be
here with, Corinne.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> We are delighted
to have you here.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Now I understand that you're
not too often on the radio.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.337 align:middle line:84%
But without you, there is
no New Dimensions Radio.

00:01:58.337 --> 00:01:59.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I'd like to think that.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's true.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not often on this
side of the microphones,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:90%
but I'm more behind the scenes.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:84%
Yet, I work in deep
partnership with Michael

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and with a crew of other people
to put the radio program on,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
to start it, to begin it, even
from the very beginning when

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't a radio program.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.340 align:middle line:90%
>> We'd like to hear about that.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
But first, we'd
like to introduce

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.855 align:middle line:90%
Michael, Michael Toms.

00:02:24.855 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Corinne, it's
nice to be here.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.733 align:middle line:84%
>> How does it feel to be at
the other end of an interview?

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a
different feeling.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, for sure.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.720 align:middle line:84%
>> You think you're going
to be able to do it, huh?

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I hope so.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.230 align:middle line:84%
>> 24 years of being
on all this time.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe I've learned
something in that period.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us a little bit
about the background.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.890 align:middle line:90%
How did it start, Michael?

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was
an idea actually.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.850 align:middle line:84%
It didn't start with
the idea of doing radio.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.010 align:middle line:10%
It started with the idea
of bringing together

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.330 align:middle line:10%
a lot of diverse ideas
and ways of looking

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:10%
at the world, different
perspectives that were emerging

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:10%
in the late '60s, early '70s.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And we saw the need for an
organization, an entity that

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.250 align:middle line:84%
would overview all
these different things

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and not take sides, as it were,
but to present the perspectives

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and allow the
people to hear them

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.327 align:middle line:84%
in a way that would
let them judge and make

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.160 align:middle line:90%
their own decisions.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So out of that, we started
New Dimensions Foundation.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And we started
doing conferences.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.650 align:middle line:84%
A lecture series was the
first thing we did, actually,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.120 align:middle line:90%
a six part lecture series.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.210 align:middle line:84%
And during the lecture series,
someone came up to us and said,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.010 align:middle line:84%
you ought to do
this on the radio.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that led to our actually
doing a program on radio,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.040 align:middle line:84%
and we started in
San Francisco in 1973

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.080 align:middle line:84%
doing a half hour
every other week.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And that led to a half
hour and then an hour.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And then pretty soon, we
were doing four hours a week

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:90%
on Saturday night.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:90%
We had a four hour live program.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:84%
We did that for five
years, became really

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:90%
an institution in the Bay Area.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:90%
Thousands of people listened.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.432 align:middle line:84%
And we cut our eye teeth
there on the radio.

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a great
learning experience.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Who were some of the people
that started out with you?

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.937 align:middle line:84%
You said there were
about six people.

00:03:59.937 --> 00:04:01.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there was
Justine and I, of course.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And then Stephen Hill,
who later went on

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.920 align:middle line:84%
to create music from
the Hearts of Space,

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and now is the creator
of four record companies,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.790 align:middle line:84%
and has been doing music
in the area of what's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
called space music and new
age music, that kind of thing.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Stephen was our
original engineer.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.267 align:middle line:84%
Dan Drayson, who is
still with us actually,

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:21.850 align:middle line:84%
is the announcer
that gives the theme,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.558 align:middle line:84%
it is only through a
change of conscience

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
that the world will
be transformed.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually our
operations director now.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Larry Geiss was
around at the time.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.880 align:middle line:90%
He's a CPA.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.380 align:middle line:84%
He's still on our
board of directors

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:84%
and gives us financial
advice from time to time.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
Who else, Justine?

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Who else would be on that was
part of the original group?

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Will [INAUDIBLE],,
Will was my co-host

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.763 align:middle line:84%
on New Dimensions for
a number of years.

00:04:46.763 --> 00:04:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And he was there
at the beginning.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.430 align:middle line:84%
He later went on
to do other things.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> When you have
these workshops,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.120 align:middle line:84%
what were some of the early
people that came to present?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, well, early on,
there was Ram Doss, I think.

00:05:01.237 --> 00:05:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's been
presenting for years.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> For years and years.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.240 align:middle line:90%
And there was Werner Earhart.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
There was Joe Campbell
in the early years.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.680 align:middle line:10%
In their early '70s, we started
interviewing Joseph Campbell,

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:10%
who is the person who's
popularized mythology

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.760 align:middle line:10%
in America.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:10%
He died, I believe, in 1983.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:90%
>> '87.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, excuse me.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.070 align:middle line:90%
He died in 1987.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And we spent hours
and hours with him.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:90%
What an amazing person.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.700 align:middle line:84%
For me, to consider
myth, we usually

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:84%
use that word thinking about
it as it's a fairy tale,

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.720 align:middle line:90%
or it's not true.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:90%
A myth is not being true.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.130 align:middle line:84%
But the way Joseph
talked about it,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
he talks about mythology
as being very true

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
on another realm and another
channel, so to speak.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.980 align:middle line:10%
So he made myth very relevant to
today's everyday world for us.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
>> How did it change your life
to meet someone like Joseph

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Campbell?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it just opened
up a whole new avenue.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, that's the way
New Dimensions works.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And it mostly works
for me and for Michael.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So we do this because it
really changes our life.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And it opened up my life in
a way of looking at dreams,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:84%
even looking at the Bible
in a mythological way.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.850 align:middle line:90%
There's a historical way.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And then you can also look
at in the mythological way.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:90%
I can give an example.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.890 align:middle line:84%
In the story of Pontius
Pilate, when he went out

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.410 align:middle line:84%
to seek the baby, and he
killed all the young children

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
at the time when he
heard about the Messiah.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you take that into your
life in a mythological way--

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It was David, King David.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, was it?

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry to interrupt you.

00:06:52.713 --> 00:06:53.865 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, anyway.

00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what husbands
are for, right?

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.210 align:middle line:90%
They interrupt.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It was Herod.

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It was Herod.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Herod, yes.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We work like
this all the time.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
It was Herod.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think of doing
a new project, you think,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.060 align:middle line:84%
well, you may not
want it just out there

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
in the world for all the
critics to get onto it.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way of
taking some information

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and musing it in
a way in our lives

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
that it's a baby that needs
to be protected for a while

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.700 align:middle line:84%
before it goes out
to the whole world

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to just pronounce
bad judgments on it.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:28.927 align:middle line:90%
So that's one of the ways.

00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you think
about it really,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:84%
when you start a new project,
for anyone who in this audience

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:84%
who is starting a new business,
starting a new project,

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.263 align:middle line:84%
the first thing people do
is try to shoot you down.

00:07:40.263 --> 00:07:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So what you're saying
is say, oh, well, that's

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.780 align:middle line:90%
not going to be.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:90%
What about this?

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.553 align:middle line:90%
And what about that?

00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I knew somebody who
went to that business.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:90%
It was terrible.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:90%
People do shoot you down.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's probably
very indicative of the way we

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
should nurture a new
project in our lives.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say when we started,
it was quite the opposite.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:84%
We set about to connect
with those people

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
that we wanted to
involve ourselves

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
with their ideas and books
and that kind of thing.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:10%
And everyone we talked to
was very supportive and very

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:10%
positive and gave us
lots of good feedback

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:10%
and gave us the kind
of support energy

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:10%
that was really
important at that time.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And we got very little
negative feedback.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't go
to, well, we didn't

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
go to professionals in the
sense of people producing

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.385 align:middle line:84%
conferences or
producing broadcasts

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:30.433 align:middle line:90%
and that kind of thing.

00:08:30.433 --> 00:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
If we had, we probably
would have gotten

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.225 align:middle line:90%
a lot of negative feedback.

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:34.836 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't do
that, fortunately.

00:08:34.836 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
And so we had a lot of positive
energy at the beginning.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:38.392 align:middle line:90%
That helped a lot.

00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
And then as we
continued on and we

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.090 align:middle line:84%
started doing
radio and doing it,

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
then more and more people
became even more supportive

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.440 align:middle line:90%
as we continued to do it.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.660 align:middle line:84%
As we continued
over the years, one

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
keeps us going

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.620 align:middle line:90%
is the kind of feedback we get.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The positive feedback from
not only our listeners,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
but also from the guests
who come through our studio

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:90%
and experience what we do.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.690 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the people that we
had on early that we met early

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:84%
on in our career was
Buckminster Fuller.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And he was the creator
of the geodesic dome.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:90%
He did the Dymaxion car.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
He was an inventor and
just a wonderful person.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.000 align:middle line:10%
>> He did some of that crazy
things that people, what is it?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.370 align:middle line:90%
That house?

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Dymaxion house, yes.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:24.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, that's right.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:29.340 align:middle line:84%
And he was coming towards
the end of his career.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.590 align:middle line:90%
He was in his 70s then.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said that meeting us
and meeting the kind of people

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.680 align:middle line:84%
that we were working with
was a evolutionary event.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.027 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
first meeting him.

00:09:43.027 --> 00:09:43.860 align:middle line:90%
He was so impressed.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:90%
He's not a large man.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:90%
He was a small man.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.055 align:middle line:10%
And I met him at a party
first off, before we actually,

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:10%
oh, actually, Michael
had done the interview.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.585 align:middle line:90%
But afterwards--

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:54.002 align:middle line:84%
>> Right after the
interview, yes.

00:09:54.002 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And afterwards, we got
together at a little gathering.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.380 align:middle line:10%
And I remember him walking up
to me and introducing himself.

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:10%
And that impressed me so
much, because who wouldn't

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:10%
know who Bucky Fuller was?

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:90%
We called him Bucky.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet, he had this humbleness
about him to introduce himself

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.700 align:middle line:84%
and not to assume that
I would know who he was.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's when he
told me, he said

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
he had just done an interview
with Michael, and he said,

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
that was an evolutionary event.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And did you
know Michael then?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:90%
Were you married then?

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.850 align:middle line:90%
>> We were married.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you were married?

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> But I just didn't happen to
be there during that particular

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:90%
interview for whatever reason.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:30.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm usually there.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:10%
But in that particular
interview, I wasn't there.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.340 align:middle line:10%
And we've really used,
he's been a mentor for us

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.540 align:middle line:10%
for through the years
that we've done our work.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Really trying to do more
with less, number one.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Another is to try
and do something

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:90%
that no one else is doing.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody else is doing
it, then let them do it.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:90%
And you go figure--

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't compete.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:90%
Your own unique place.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's switch back to
someone here that you never had

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.740 align:middle line:84%
a chance to interview, but
has been a great source

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:90%
of inspiration.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.750 align:middle line:90%
And that is Thomas Jefferson.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd love to interview
Thomas Jefferson.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:90%
That would be great.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:90%
>> What would you ask him?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, Thomas
Jefferson was the first

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.073 align:middle line:84%
comprehensivist that
I came in touch with.

00:11:17.073 --> 00:11:17.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was raised--

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Now what is a
comprehensivist?

00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It's someone who thinks
about a lot of things and has

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:84%
knowledge about a lot of
things, not a specialist.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.740 align:middle line:84%
In our society,
in our age, we've

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:90%
become an age of specialists.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And this has caused
no end of problems

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.980 align:middle line:84%
because everyone
is over specialized

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.518 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't see
the whole picture.

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:90%
We don't think in wholes.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:90%
We think in parts.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Jefferson thought in wholes.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So he was a whole
systems thinker.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And even in his time, he
was a whole systems thinker.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And he knew a lot
about a lot of things.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, Jefferson
was a philosopher.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.510 align:middle line:90%
He was a writer.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.140 align:middle line:90%
He was an inventor.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.030 align:middle line:90%
He was an historian.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:90%
He was an archeologist.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:90%
He was a collector of fine art.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:90%
He was he was an architect.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:90%
He built Monticello.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful,
beautiful building.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:84%
He created the University of
Virginia, major accomplishment.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:84%
University started with
Thomas Jefferson's library.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.610 align:middle line:84%
That's how it began because he
had such a wonderful library

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.410 align:middle line:90%
of books.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you ask him
if you had him here today?

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I would ask him probably
what he thinks we could do about

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
what our government has become,
how we could recreate democracy

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.040 align:middle line:84%
in the United States, how we
could come back in touch with

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.370 align:middle line:84%
the vision that
launched our nation,

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
that vision of wholeness and
democracy for everyone one,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.023 align:middle line:84%
we're all created equal,
with life, liberty,

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and the pursuit of happiness,
how that could be true

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:43.650 align:middle line:84%
for everyone in our society,
not just for some people,

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.613 align:middle line:90%
but for everyone.

00:12:44.613 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
I think Jefferson
would have some really

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.820 align:middle line:84%
important and relevant
things to say to us today.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Have any idea what they might
be based on what he's written

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.890 align:middle line:90%
before?

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well one of the things
Jefferson wrote and said was

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.595 align:middle line:84%
that every good democracy needs
a revolution every 20 years.

00:13:00.595 --> 00:13:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Now he wasn't
necessarily talking

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
about a violent
revolution, but he

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.510 align:middle line:84%
was talking about a
revolution in thinking,

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:84%
a revolution in
perspective, a revolution

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.520 align:middle line:84%
in looking at the world
and looking at our society

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:84%
in new and different ways,
because we do get in tracks.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.730 align:middle line:84%
We create patterns of
operating and patterns

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%
of the ways we do things.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it seems
like a time, I think

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Jefferson would say it's a
time to step back and reflect

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:90%
on where we have come.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we've accomplished
a great deal.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot
more to accomplish.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot that we've
lost in the last 200 years

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.510 align:middle line:90%
from our original vision.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to
the what created

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
the 13 colonies and the
United States of America.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:84%
What was the compelling
motivation for that to happen?

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.800 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
Jefferson would point us to.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can, from
your studying him,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.155 align:middle line:84%
you can kind of take the
question and the answer.

00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:55.007 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to
you more about this.

00:13:55.007 --> 00:13:56.840 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to take
just a little break,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.960 align:middle line:84%
and we'll be right back with
these fascinating guests,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Michael and Justine Toms.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.115 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.115 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for staying with us.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:10%
We are right here with
our wonderful guests

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:middle line:10%
from New Dimensions Radio.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.470 align:middle line:10%
Justine Toms, thanks so much
for being with us today.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And, Michael, who I think
we're on a roll here talking

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:90%
about Thomas Jefferson.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my
favorite characters.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.692 align:middle line:84%
Yes, actually, the last
president I really liked.

00:14:24.692 --> 00:14:27.725 align:middle line:84%
That's not really true, but
certainly a great president,

00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:29.760 align:middle line:90%
a great individual.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you stopped by saying
before we went to break,

00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:35.300 align:middle line:84%
you said something that Thomas
Jefferson thought we ought

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
to have some kind of a
revolution every 20 years

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:90%
of some sort.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> He said democracy needs a
good revolution every 20 years,

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.410 align:middle line:90%
a revolution every 20 years.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:43.952 align:middle line:10%
And I think what he
was talking about

00:14:43.952 --> 00:14:49.820 align:middle line:10%
was that we need to review
where we've come every so often.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:10%
The last real review we
had was the Civil War,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.880 align:middle line:10%
the war between the states.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.243 align:middle line:90%
And that was over 100 years ago.

00:14:57.243 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:90%
And that was a review.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.140 align:middle line:84%
That was a deepening of what
our commitment was as a nation,

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and where there were
some states that wanted

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.820 align:middle line:90%
to leave the United States.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.243 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
a war about that.

00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:90%
There was a Civil War.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:90%
It was a violent war.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.720 align:middle line:84%
That was really the last time
we really looked at things.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
so I think we're

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
overdue to review
where we've been.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> So we're way over 20 years?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Way over 20 years, yes.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Way over 20 years.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
>> You've interviewed so
many different people.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there any one
today that you look

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
to who perhaps
would epitomize some

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
of the qualities and
judgments of Thomas Jefferson?

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there are some
leaders in the world today.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
I Vaclav Havel,
the Czech Republic,

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I think he is very exemplary of
a modern leader in government

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
who embodies not just
the political spectrum,

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
but also embodies the
spiritual spectrum

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.280 align:middle line:84%
and the historical
mythic spectrum.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's a
poet and a writer,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.793 align:middle line:84%
and somehow now finds
himself as president

00:16:05.793 --> 00:16:06.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Czech Republic.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I've heard Havel
speak, and I've read his books,

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.890 align:middle line:84%
he's very much a
visionary thinker.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's that kind
of person, I mean,

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.290 align:middle line:84%
the people who are in
positions of power,

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.690 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me like the
presidency of the United States

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.098 align:middle line:84%
is really a position of
vision and leadership.

00:16:24.098 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not a position
of having to deal

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
with the nitty gritty
political machinations that

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:90%
go on in government.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it needs
to be above that.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.560 align:middle line:84%
The president or the
leader of any government

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.928 align:middle line:84%
needs to express the
vision for the people.

00:16:36.928 --> 00:16:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I think Havel
is an example of that.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.480 align:middle line:84%
I think Nelson Mandela
is an expression

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.070 align:middle line:90%
of that in South Africa.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
He represents a people's vision
of wanting equality and wanting

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:90%
to be equal.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:52.580 align:middle line:84%
It's that vision
that's the power.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think another leader of
an exiled nation, the Dalai

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:84%
Lama of Tibet, who won the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1989

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
for his efforts on behalf
of his country, which

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
has being oppressed by the
Chinese for the last 40 years.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And yet, the Dalai
Lama, I've never heard

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.672 align:middle line:84%
him say a bad word
about the Chinese.

00:17:13.672 --> 00:17:15.589 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard, in
fact, any of the Tibetans

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.964 align:middle line:84%
say a bad word
about the Chinese.

00:17:16.964 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
They're incredibly
tolerant and understanding

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.996 align:middle line:84%
considering they've had
their nation taken away

00:17:22.996 --> 00:17:24.829 align:middle line:84%
and over a million
Tibetans have been killed

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:84%
and over 6,000
monasteries were destroyed

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in the Cultural Revolution,
terrible, terrible tragedy.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, out of that
tragedy called Tibet,

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.870 align:middle line:84%
we have been blessed
by the wisdom that

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:84%
has come out of Tibet, namely
through Tibetan Buddhism

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and through the Dalai Lama and
his expression in our world.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you interviewed him?

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I have actually.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you like that?

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I enjoyed it very much.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you ask him?

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.572 align:middle line:84%
>> It was quite a privilege,
I felt, to interview him.

00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the things
I remember asking about

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
was his involvement
with Thomas Merton,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%
the Catholic Trappist monk.

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Because Merton, in the
last months of his life,

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.730 align:middle line:84%
visited India,
visited Dharamsala,

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
and had several meetings
with the Dalai Lama.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And Merton then was,
just a short time

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.380 align:middle line:84%
after that, a month or so
after meeting the Dalai Lama,

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.600 align:middle line:90%
was tragically killed.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:84%
He was electrocuted, a bad
electric fan in a hotel

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:90%
room in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.745 align:middle line:84%
And so Merton died at
53, a very young man.

00:18:24.745 --> 00:18:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the Dalai
Lama and Merton

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.640 align:middle line:90%
had a very good connection.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when I asked the
Dalai Lama about Merton,

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.430 align:middle line:84%
his eyes lit up, and he
suddenly became very animated,

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and he very much related how he
really enjoyed meeting Merton.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that there was
a real brotherly connection.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Because they met not at the
level of religious dogma,

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:84%
but they met at the level
of deep spiritual experience

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.440 align:middle line:90%
that both men had had.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And that was the level they
encountered one another at.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Tibetans called
Merton a Catholic geshe.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.420 align:middle line:84%
Geshe is the highest term
of Tibetan can give another.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like a teacher,
a holy teacher.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And so they called Merton a
Catholic geshe, a Catholic

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Lama.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.967 align:middle line:84%
And so the Dalai
Lama expressed regret

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:84%
that Merton had died young
because he felt that they had

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.940 align:middle line:84%
work to do together,
and there was something

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.048 align:middle line:84%
that Christianity has something
to offer the Buddhists.

00:19:20.048 --> 00:19:22.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Buddhists have
something to offer Christianity.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.768 align:middle line:90%
There's east and west there.

00:19:23.768 --> 00:19:25.310 align:middle line:84%
The Buddhists have
done a lot of work

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
in the whole area of
meditation and understanding

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.000 align:middle line:90%
the psychology of the mind.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
They've developed
incredible tools

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.172 align:middle line:84%
for understanding how we
think and how our mind works.

00:19:34.172 --> 00:19:35.630 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
Christianity has

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.980 align:middle line:84%
had a great force of doing
social good in the world

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.450 align:middle line:90%
and social service.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And that hasn't so much true
in Buddhism in the east.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And so here's something where
both religious traditions can

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:90%
offer something to one another.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think the Dalai
Lama talks about that.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.130 align:middle line:84%
There's been quite a
number of conferences

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
in recent years of
Christians and Buddhists

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.190 align:middle line:84%
meeting together to talk about
the parallels and the things

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.612 align:middle line:84%
that they can learn
from one another.

00:20:03.612 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:90%
>> But you must have met him.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.237 align:middle line:84%
You must have been
there, Justine.

00:20:06.237 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I was.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me your impressions.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.260 align:middle line:84%
When he walked in, how did
you feel, the Dalai Lama?

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.937 align:middle line:90%
>> He was so gracious.

00:20:13.937 --> 00:20:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And there was no one
else in the room.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, no, one other
person in the room.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.400 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't like this
big entourage with him.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:90%
And he was so gracious.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I remember after the
interview, I was so nervous.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And I brought my camera
because I wanted to take a

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And Michael had he
said, now, Justine,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
don't forget to use the camera.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was so nervous, I
forgot to use the camera.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as we were
getting up to leave,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.110 align:middle line:90%
he noticed the camera.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:90%
He said, oh, here, your camera.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.160 align:middle line:84%
Let's take, here, have
someone take a picture of us.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.060 align:middle line:90%
So he did my job for me.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's the way he is.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter if it's
with the highest heads of state

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.400 align:middle line:84%
or if it's with
just the lowliest,

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:84%
well, there is no lowly
person, but someone

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.660 align:middle line:90%
who's not the head of state.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.310 align:middle line:84%
He's that gracious
with everyone.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:84%
He really and his
laughter is wonderful.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
>> He has a wonderful
sense of humor.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Just wonderful.

00:21:12.042 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I was with him one
time when somebody,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.680 align:middle line:84%
I was at a press conference
when it was just a few people,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and somebody asked him if
he still ate Chinese food.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.775 align:middle line:90%
He laughed.

00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:90%
He thought that was so funny.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.560 align:middle line:84%
He said, of course
he eats Chinese food.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, why wouldn't
he eat Chinese food?

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm not mad at them.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if I get mad at
the Chinese, I don't sleep.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:90%
I don't have good digestion.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.790 align:middle line:90%
>> So I don't get mad.

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So that was triggered
by that question

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.350 align:middle line:90%
does he ever eat Chinese food.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I know we were with the
Dalai Lama in Costa Rica many

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:90%
years ago.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was for a
conference seeking

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.750 align:middle line:90%
the true meaning of peace.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said something like
that at this conference,

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.710 align:middle line:90%
and it changed my life.

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:03.790 align:middle line:10%
And he was talking about
how being mad at someone

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.470 align:middle line:10%
or about being pessimistic.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.090 align:middle line:10%
Someone asked him the question,
well, why are you so happy?

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, here, your
country is decimated.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Your language, they're
trying to end your language

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:90%
in your country and so forth.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.710 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, it hurts
me to be to be pessimistic.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.340 align:middle line:84%
I feel better when
I'm optimistic.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And someone said,
well, but you may never

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:90%
get your country back.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, I don't
do it for that reason.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I do it because it's a
right and good thing to do.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
when he said that,

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.110 align:middle line:84%
that I was hedging my
bets in my own life

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:45.280 align:middle line:84%
that I would do a project if
I felt like it would succeed.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But he was doing it because
it was right and good,

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
not whether it would
succeed or not.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And if every one of us
worked with what we know

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
is good and right, then
all of it would succeed.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a real pleasure.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:00.730 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being with us.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Our pleasure.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:11.894 align:middle line:90%
