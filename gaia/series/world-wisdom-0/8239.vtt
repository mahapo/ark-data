00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:10%
>> There are some exciting
innovations developing

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680 align:middle line:10%
in the field of emotional
intelligence that take us

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.280 align:middle line:10%
directly into the untapped
brilliance of the human mind.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.560 align:middle line:84%
My guest today
shares with us how

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
to bring love and lasting
prosperity to our families,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:84%
our businesses, and
our planet as a whole.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.670 align:middle line:84%
He is a consultant,
the executive coach

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and president of the Institute
for Personal and Professional

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.050 align:middle line:90%
Development.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.080 align:middle line:84%
He speaks and conducts
workshops internationally

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:84%
on emotional
intelligence and health

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.768 align:middle line:84%
in personal and
professional relationships.

00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
It gives me great pleasure
to welcome Dr. Bill DeFoore.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being with us.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carolyn.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, emotional
intelligence,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:84%
there's been a lot written
about it and it's--

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.557 align:middle line:90%
the word is floated around.

00:01:15.557 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Some of us know a
little bit about it.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And a whole lot of us know
not a whole lot about it.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So why don't we
begin with an idea

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.720 align:middle line:84%
of what emotional
intelligence is all about?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, one of the things
that I find fascinating about

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.340 align:middle line:10%
emotional intelligence is that
it really combines two worlds,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.970 align:middle line:10%
in a sense.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:84%
If we say someone is emotional,
that's not a compliment

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.340 align:middle line:90%
ordinarily.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, yeah.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And if we say someone
is intelligent, it is.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So what we've done here
is brought two aspects

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
of our humanness together
that have been, in a way,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:90%
like shadow and light.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The emotion, the emotional part
of us has stayed in the shadow.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Because somehow we're not
supposed to be emotional.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.480 align:middle line:90%
And yet we are.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of
emotional intelligence

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.880 align:middle line:84%
means being intelligent
about our emotions,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.419 align:middle line:84%
knowing and understanding
them, and intelligent in how

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:84%
we use them in our everyday
lives and in our businesses.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something there,
beginning to see how we learn

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.240 align:middle line:90%
differently.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And emotional intelligence
has something to do with that,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
One thing is that
fear and anger reduce

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:84%
the capacity of the higher
brain, the neocortex,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:90%
and inhibit learning.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:10%
And if we're having fun and we
feel connected to other people

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:10%
and feel safe and cared
for, we learn more rapidly

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:10%
and retain the
information longer.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So a child, or even
a student in college,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.550 align:middle line:84%
or someone that's
gone back to college,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:84%
anything that we're
trying to learn,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.640 align:middle line:84%
if we can in some way make it
appeal to our, where we are

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.230 align:middle line:90%
emotionally, it will help?

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.090 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And recognizing the place
and the value of each emotion

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:90%
is essential.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Fear and anger have their place.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.180 align:middle line:90%
And yet, they inhibit learning.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.663 align:middle line:84%
>> So if I am trying to learn
something and I'm fearful

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:84%
of that I'm not going to be able
to learn it or there's anything

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.990 align:middle line:84%
in my personal life that's
going on, or if the instructor

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
somehow promotes
a sense of fear,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:84%
then I'm not going to
be able to integrate it.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you work
for an organization

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
in which intimidation and fear
based management is the norm,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
then there will be a
pervading sense of fear,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
usually subconscious, throughout
the organization, which

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.200 align:middle line:84%
inhibits creative thinking
and learning and growth

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.880 align:middle line:90%
within the organization.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:84%
>> What have you found from
people who have deepened

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
their understanding of
emotional intelligence?

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
What have they
gained in their life?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
What have they
learned about themself

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:84%
and how has it
changed their life?

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think probably one of
the most profound impacts

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of increased emotional
intelligence, Carolyn,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
is intuition and a greater
sense of trust in one's own

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.350 align:middle line:90%
intuition.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:10%
Intuition is the head and
the heart working together

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:10%
to create a brilliant,
innovative idea about how

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.260 align:middle line:10%
to handle this
personal situation,

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.550 align:middle line:10%
or how to respond to
this business challenge.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Every great business
leader understands

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.230 align:middle line:90%
the value of intuition.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:10%
We simply don't have enough
time to gather all of the facts.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, the facts
are simply not available.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:10%
And so it is intuition
that gives us the ability

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:10%
to move quickly and effectively
in situations which are perhaps

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.570 align:middle line:10%
poorly defined.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So how is our intuition
and our emotional intelligence

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:90%
joined together?

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
What is-- deepen my
understanding in that area.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, intelligence
is about the intellect,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:84%
which is about the functioning
of certain components

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.650 align:middle line:90%
of the brain.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:10%
And emotion has
more to do with what

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.340 align:middle line:10%
we call the heart, the
metaphorical heart.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with the right brain

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
and the emotional
brain, which is

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
the mammalian and reptilian
aspects of the brain.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But you know, an interesting
kind of side comment

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:84%
here is that the actual
physical organ of the heart--

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
this is discovered by
HeartMath institute--

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
the physical organ
of the human heart

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.250 align:middle line:84%
works better when we express
love and appreciation

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and functions more poorly when
we are cynical and expressing

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
doubt and fear.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's an interesting thing.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The physical heart
wants us, likes it

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
when we are expressing
love and appreciation.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.562 align:middle line:84%
>> And feeling loved
and appreciated also.

00:05:47.562 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Again, I'm thinking
that that's when we'd

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:90%
be more receptive to learning.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Are there different levels
of emotional intelligence

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:90%
with different people?

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:10%
There is an EQ map
that has been developed

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:10%
by an organization
in San Francisco that

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.190 align:middle line:10%
is a very user friendly
self-evaluation kind of way

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.860 align:middle line:10%
of measuring emotional
intelligence that

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:10%
points specifically and directly
to what we can do to raise it.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And so there are clearly
delineated processes

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
for measuring and for increasing
emotional intelligence that

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:84%
can be applied in the personal
and professional dimensions.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So we want to increase
our emotional intelligence.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And what happens, what
are some of the, I guess,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.910 align:middle line:84%
the benefits that we derive
from having more awareness

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and increased intelligence
about our emotions?

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>> One great benefit is an
improved ability to communicate

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
clearly and directly, and fewer
obstacles and barriers between

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.650 align:middle line:84%
us and significant
people in our lives.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Whether those are business
associates or loved ones,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.570 align:middle line:90%
family members, dear friends.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:10%
So barriers are removed
as clarity and precision

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:10%
in communication is increased.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:90%
That's one area.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Another area has to do with
adaptability and flexibility,

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
being able to move
quickly and effectively

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:90%
through stressful situations.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:10%
Because it is anger and fear
and related feelings of feeling

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.910 align:middle line:10%
paralyzed or stressed
out or overwhelmed that

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:10%
slow us down or
even stop us cold

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.240 align:middle line:10%
in those stressful situations.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.100 align:middle line:84%
The more at peace we
are and the more fluid

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
we are in how we are
managing our emotions,

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.320 align:middle line:84%
the more effectively we can move
through stress and even crisis.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So crisis management
becomes much more easy

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and flowing with
emotional intelligence.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill, give me an example.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Give us an example of
what managing our emotions

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
might look like, in either a
business or personal situation.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's first of
all an internal process.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.250 align:middle line:90%
It means I need to know myself.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And I need to know
how to respond when

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.860 align:middle line:90%
I feel my emotions coming up.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.690 align:middle line:84%
If I am aware of some anger,
some fear, some sorrow that's

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.810 align:middle line:84%
in me, knowing what
I can do about that,

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily to eliminate
it, but to respond to it,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps to communicate
effectively from that emotion.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:10%
Because what we're
finding in business,

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:10%
for example, is that if
you and I are in a business

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:41.080 align:middle line:10%
relationship and I'm feeling
a particularly large amount

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.429 align:middle line:10%
of sorrow today--

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.730 align:middle line:10%
I may know some of the
reasons, I may not know them--

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:10%
if I can talk to you briefly
about that before we begin

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.940 align:middle line:10%
any of our business
processes, we

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:10%
will do much better business.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:84%
I will be more fully
in the relationship

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and we will be more effective
in our business processes.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So what would you say?

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:90%
We're sitting down.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.927 align:middle line:84%
There's a board meeting
that's about to start.

00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And you're across
the table from me.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.890 align:middle line:84%
What would be--
what would you say?

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say, I'd
like you to know--

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and let's say that the
whole group is here.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:10%
I'd like all of you to know that
I'm feeling some sadness today,

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.560 align:middle line:10%
and I've got some ideas
of why that's there.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.660 align:middle line:10%
There's some
problems in my family

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:10%
that I may talk with you
individually about later.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's some of this
that I'm not quite sure about.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.700 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps I'll learn more
as the day goes on.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But I wanted you
to know that this

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:90%
is what's going on with me.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:10%
And it's not about you
or our subject matter.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
This is who I am today
and this is what I'm

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
bringing into this situation.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would suspect
as a result then,

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.360 align:middle line:90%
it wouldn't come up.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:90%
It would be managed.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't come up in
a different way, maybe

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
a fearful way or something, when
a subject matter is brought up

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
at the business meeting that has
nothing to do with your sorrow.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, your sorrow
would enter into that.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.760 align:middle line:10%
And to play this out
a little further,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.710 align:middle line:10%
let's say we have some
important business

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:10%
decisions to make today.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is how I feel.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.570 align:middle line:84%
Fear and anger can immediately
be triggered by this feeling

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.710 align:middle line:90%
that I'm having.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.080 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not aware of it
and in touch with it

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and I haven't come
clear with the group

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and really presented myself, who
I am and how I feel, then one,

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:84%
my decision making will be
affected by my emotions.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.350 align:middle line:84%
I will be too fearful and
perhaps pass on a good business

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.410 align:middle line:84%
opportunity, based
on a personal emotion

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not in touch with.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be
blocked, in some way.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.207 align:middle line:90%
>> I would be blocked.

00:10:42.207 --> 00:10:44.290 align:middle line:10%
And you, and other
board members,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:10%
might misinterpret my
affect, the feeling

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:10%
that I put into what I
say, as related to them

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.420 align:middle line:10%
or related to the
business, when it really

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:10%
has nothing to do with
what's going on at the table.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And you expect me, then,
to not have a long response,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.780 align:middle line:84%
but at least to
acknowledge where you are.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
kind of pave the way

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:90%
to have a good business meeting.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.003 align:middle line:84%
When we come back-- we
need to take a moment

00:11:15.003 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:84%
to hear from our supporters--
and when we come back,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:84%
let's talk a little
bit more about how

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.000 align:middle line:84%
this also, the awareness
of emotional intelligence

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.263 align:middle line:84%
affects our personal
life, as well.

00:11:25.263 --> 00:11:26.680 align:middle line:84%
You're watching
"World of Wisdom."

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm Carolyn Craft.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking with
Dr. Bill DeFoore.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Stay tuned.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.818 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:35.734 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And welcome back to
"A World of Wisdom."

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:10%
I'm Carolyn Craft, and I'm
speaking with Dr. Bill DeFoore.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:53.940 align:middle line:10%
And we are talking about
emotional intelligence.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:10%
And specifically,
we were speaking

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.460 align:middle line:10%
earlier about emotional
intelligence in the workplace.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Something you say, business
is always personal.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Explain how it's
always personal for us.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, in a kind of
a philosophical sense,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:10%
we could say that there aren't
any people on this planet who

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.840 align:middle line:10%
are not engaged in
some kind of business.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.700 align:middle line:10%
And so to that extent,
everyone is a business person.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:10%
From the person on the
street corner with a tin can

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:10%
and maybe a little
homemade instrument,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.880 align:middle line:10%
they're trying to get
people to contribute with,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:10%
to the person who's
literally buying and selling

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:10%
money on Wall Street.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And on the full range,
that's all exchange

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.970 align:middle line:90%
of goods and services.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And in another
sense, our economy,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:50.970 align:middle line:84%
our global economy
affects everyone.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.030 align:middle line:84%
So what happens in
the business world,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.400 align:middle line:84%
decisions made by
corporate leaders,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
by government leaders
regarding economic values,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.190 align:middle line:90%
affects everyone.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.970 align:middle line:84%
It affects the quality
of goods and services

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.570 align:middle line:90%
that are available to us.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.740 align:middle line:84%
It affects the availability
of those goods and services.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So our economy is
a living, breathing

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:90%
aspect of our consciousness.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.250 align:middle line:90%
And we are all part of that.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:84%
So to that extent,
business is personal.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.890 align:middle line:84%
If something happens in Japan
with their economy, we feel it.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:10%
And we recently had a major
crisis in the Eastern economy

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.550 align:middle line:10%
which had a great impact
on our stock prices.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like that you talk
about the shadow side of what

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
we bring to business,
and business shadow side.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It seems like in addressing
the emotional intelligence,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
we're perhaps putting light
on what is already personal

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:84%
anyway and happening
there anyway?

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:10%
It's rather than running from
that downturn in our profits

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:10%
or pretending that the conflicts
and the vendettas and the games

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:10%
and the backstabbing
at work are not there,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:10%
we turn and look
directly at them.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And we look not at them to
fix them or change them,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.300 align:middle line:90%
but to find the value.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:84%
What is the learning
that we can gain

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.830 align:middle line:84%
from examining exactly what's
going on in this perhaps

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.650 align:middle line:84%
long-term vendetta,
which can be extremely

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.960 align:middle line:84%
costly in the
business relationship.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Or in a family.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:84%
If two people in a family
are not getting along,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
it affects everyone
else in the family

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and it has a tremendous
emotional drain on everyone.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
What can be gained by
looking specifically at that

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and using some very clear and
practical tools for opening it

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.420 align:middle line:90%
up to meaningful communication?

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You do workshops
all over the world.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And you work with
businesses, in particular two

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:90%
that are opening up to this.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.940 align:middle line:84%
They do need a facilitator
in the beginning,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle line:84%
I would think, to
understand this.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Then what do they do?

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.460 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what happens--

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
again, going back to
that board meeting.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:84%
We all come in around
the table there.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And you've been there and shared
with us some ways to sit there

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.700 align:middle line:84%
and actually share
what's going on with us.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:90%
And then you're gone.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:84%
What helps us make
that transition

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
and know that that's
a real good thing

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.320 align:middle line:84%
to be doing with one another,
to really understand and manage

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.600 align:middle line:90%
our emotional intelligence?

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Organizations that
apply these principles

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
on a consistent basis
increase their level of trust.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And because their level
of trust is increased,

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:49.740 align:middle line:84%
they're more honest and
more current and more open.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And then the empowerment of
individuals and work teams

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.150 align:middle line:90%
automatically results.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.722 align:middle line:84%
And business leaders will
say, you take care of that.

00:15:59.722 --> 00:16:00.930 align:middle line:90%
Let me know how you're doing.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.860 align:middle line:90%
Ask my advice.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:90%
But it's your deal.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
I trust you to
take care of that.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:84%
One organization,
a power company

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that has plants
all over the world,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:15.930 align:middle line:84%
has someone who is a head of
maintenance doing fundraising,

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.155 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:16:17.155 --> 00:16:18.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's wonderful.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, when the rigid job
description doesn't confine

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
someone and people are empowered
to be innovative and creative

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:84%
and use untapped resources,
it's wonderful and amazing what

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:90%
can happen in an organization.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an automatic
care that's understood, too.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And I want to know what
is going on with you.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Not to be your therapist, but
to know that that part of you

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:84%
that you bring that is
in sorrow or whatever

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.950 align:middle line:90%
is an important part.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:84%
It seems that it would help
just overall communication.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think you talk
also about the retention

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:90%
level with employees.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:90%
How does it help that?

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If, or when, individuals feel
cared for in an organization,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.890 align:middle line:90%
they're more likely to stay.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:10%
The workplace surveys
that have been conducted

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:10%
indicate that pay is
third or fourth down

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.700 align:middle line:10%
in terms of priority.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Feeling connected and a
part of the organization

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:90%
is one of the first.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.869 align:middle line:10%
Another one of the top ones is
feeling an alliance of vision

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.150 align:middle line:10%
and purpose and
feeling that they

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.810 align:middle line:10%
are making a contribution
that is meaningful to them

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.490 align:middle line:10%
through their work.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.390 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'm hearing, too,
that we can learn this.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.950 align:middle line:10%
This is something
that can be learned.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:10%
It's not something that someone
has and someone doesn't.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's how we're
designed, Carolyn.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:84%
We were designed to be
joyful, exuberant, creative,

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:90%
magnificent beings.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And unexpressed fear, pain, and
anger block that brilliance.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.530 align:middle line:84%
So we don't talk
about fear and pain

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
and anger because
it's fun, simply

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.470 align:middle line:84%
because it is
effective for untapping

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.270 align:middle line:84%
the brilliance, the light
that is behind all of that.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You say there are
three areas, at least,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.660 align:middle line:90%
business and personal.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
a spiritual level

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:19.060 align:middle line:84%
that is helped if
we can understand

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:90%
our emotional intelligence.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.190 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, it's found that
people who have a spiritual

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.370 align:middle line:10%
connection of some kind are
healthier physically and live

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:28.670 align:middle line:10%
longer.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.960 align:middle line:10%
It's often also found
that business leaders who

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:10%
have some kind of
spiritual focus

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:10%
tend to be able to integrate
some elements of that

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:10%
into their work.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So for many people, a spiritual
focus is extremely important.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the elements
of that is faith.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And faith and optimism
have been found

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to consistently correlate
with health and resiliency

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.170 align:middle line:90%
regarding illness.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So spirituality has some very
practical health-related value

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:04.240 align:middle line:90%
and benefit.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.840 align:middle line:84%
The way it relates to emotional
intelligence is to the extent

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.290 align:middle line:84%
that we are captivated
by and controlled

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.940 align:middle line:84%
by our fear, or our
anger, or our vendetta,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:84%
or controlled and held
back by sorrow, or perhaps

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:84%
related depression, our
spirituality is blocked.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality aligns
itself with the emotions

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.460 align:middle line:90%
of joy, love, and exuberance.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:10%
And that is an
infinite wellspring

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:10%
inside every one of us.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what keeps us
young, and getting younger.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
What does an organization
look like that is managing

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:90%
the emotional intelligence?

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Themselves and other.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:90%
The people love their work.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:90%
They're excited, energetic.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:90%
They're real.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:10%
They're talking with each
other about their lives.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:90%
They're fully present.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:84%
They didn't leave their
heart or their body

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
or their other personal
issues at the door.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
They brought their whole
selves into the workplace.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're not cut off
from, this is my business life

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:90%
and this is my personal life.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Not at all.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And brilliantly creative, trying
things no one else has tried

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and succeeding, and
literally breaking records

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:28.880 align:middle line:84%
with profitability and growth
and sustainable, grounded

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:90%
growth.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.595 align:middle line:84%
Because often growth is like the
first indication of a decline.

00:20:33.595 --> 00:20:36.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If we know the
benefits of this,

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:84%
then what keeps us from
exploring it and allowing

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.850 align:middle line:84%
someone to be fully who they
are in the business environment

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.100 align:middle line:90%
or in our personal environment?

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Two things.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.690 align:middle line:84%
One is the presence
and the prevalence

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.850 align:middle line:90%
of fear in human consciousness.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:90%
It's huge.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's fed by much of what is
in the media and much of what

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
is just in human consciousness
and in conversation.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
The game of ain't
it awful and talking

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
about how bad things are
is a very popular game

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.932 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of people
play a lot of the time.

00:21:12.932 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like playing the
same CD over and over again.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Unconsciously,
we're feeding fear.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.200 align:middle line:90%
That's one thing.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.990 align:middle line:90%
And the other is education.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.430 align:middle line:10%
We have not been educated,
in any formal sense,

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.800 align:middle line:10%
about our emotions.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.900 align:middle line:84%
We've always had
them, but we've never

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.110 align:middle line:84%
made a specific attempt to
become intelligent about them.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you recommend to--

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.820 align:middle line:90%
in our final moments here--

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.710 align:middle line:84%
to someone who wants to
explore more about this?

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Other than we're going
to be having your books

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:45.960 align:middle line:90%
on during the breaks.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:90%
But what else could they do?

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell your story.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.000 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend to the viewers
that they tell their story

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.920 align:middle line:90%
to people who matter to them.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:59.550 align:middle line:10%
Tell about the best and the
worst of times, the memories

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.530 align:middle line:10%
that have never gone away.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:10%
And ask the people
that they love

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.573 align:middle line:10%
for their stories, the best
and the worst of those stories.

00:22:07.573 --> 00:22:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Bill DeFoore, thank you so
much for being with us on "A

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
World of Wisdom" and in
opening our heart and sharing

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.100 align:middle line:90%
your wisdom.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.073 align:middle line:90%
It's been a pleasure.

00:22:15.073 --> 00:22:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Carolyn.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And thank you for joining us.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for more
from the Wisdom Network.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.635 align:middle line:90%
