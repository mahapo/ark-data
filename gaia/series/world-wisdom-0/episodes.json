Linda MacKenzie says that the major pathways to God are truth, integrity, and love. \r\n\r\nShe explains that the reason we are here is to get back to spirituality and be one with God, and that we must take responsibility for our actions and thoughts and remain open to keep learning. MacKenzie explains that one of the ways she was able to do that was to listen to God and to open herself up to helping others. Everyone has their own unique path, she tells us, and we each need to discover our own.","teaser":"Linda MacKenzie, a holistic health practitioner and author of Inner Insights: The Book of Charts, discusses her experiences and beliefs as a God-based psychic.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/876485ff-5da2-4ef5-95af-1cf5924ff235?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/55058501-97fd-471b-b8ff-c909b03cb6a0?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/55058501-97fd-471b-b8ff-c909b03cb6a0?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/55058501-97fd-471b-b8ff-c909b03cb6a0?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Linda MacKenzie"},{"seriesId":3717,"seriesTitle":"World of Wisdom","seriesPath":"series/world-wisdom-0","seriesVoteDownCount":10,"seriesVoteUpCount":60,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/299c3322-f919-4de1-af34-74218cc5886b?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2010-09-22","episode":14,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/275fc839-c7b5-4f91-872b-8a298cca1491?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/c72a98c2-5f04-4980-b9d0-f7f5e09bd3b2?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Linda Rachel","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/living-vision-ilona-selke","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/299c3322-f919-4de1-af34-74218cc5886b?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":1,"title":"Living from Vision (Ilona Selke)","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26615","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"New Spirituality","weight":0},{"content_id":"207966","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/spiritual-growth","name":"Spiritual Growth","weight":1},{"content_id":"26649","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/interview","name":"Interview","weight":0},{"content_id":"207737","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/4-spiritual-growth-rc","name":"4 - Spiritual Growth RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"120011","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"transformation","name":"Transformation","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":1,"voteUpCount":2,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":22,"seasonCount":1,"preview":{"duration":72,"mediaId":10511,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":10511,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":1361,"mediaId":7614,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":7614,"isFree":false},"id":2793,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Wisdom lies within us all, but having the right tools to help access and use it effectively in our daily lives is key.

What is the enemy to true fulfillment? Guy Finley, author of Intimate Enemy, grew up in a family with opportunities, social status and money. Outwardly, they lived a fulfilling life, but he saw dysfunction. \r\n\r\nFinley explains that focusing on the inward self and helping oneself is not selfish. The intimate enemy is fear, which is based on not knowing who we are and what is true, and making fear-based decisions leads to dishonesty, harming both ourselves and others.\r\n\r\nSee also: Part 1","teaser":"Host Linda Rachel talks with Guy Finley, author of Intimate Enemy, about how he found his spiritual self.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/d29e1d1f-60a0-4f85-9c07-73cf7492f8c1?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3bf224ba-b466-4e84-98be-4bf6eb8feda0?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3bf224ba-b466-4e84-98be-4bf6eb8feda0?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/3bf224ba-b466-4e84-98be-4bf6eb8feda0?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Guy Finley"}]
