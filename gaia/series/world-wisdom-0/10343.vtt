00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, and welcome to
the "World of Wisdom."

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.670 align:middle line:84%
My name is Linda Rachel and
I'll be your host today.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.770 align:middle line:84%
On the "World of Wisdom,"
we are fortunate to have

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.440 align:middle line:84%
many wonderful
authors come to share

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.950 align:middle line:84%
their vision of the world,
and the visions that they have

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%
written within their own books.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have as our special
guest Michel LabrÃ©che.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:10%
Michel, it's nice
to have you with us.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Michel, your book has
a very interesting title.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.140 align:middle line:90%
It's called "The Wizard of Us."

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this wizard different
from the Wizard of Oz?

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's a bit similar.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
The things that I chose to call
the book "The Wizard of Us"

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.020 align:middle line:84%
because "us" can stand
for the person itself,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:84%
like we all possess a
wizard inside ourself.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:90%
It can stand for United States.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.790 align:middle line:90%
US.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's a play on words
with the Wizard of Oz.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Because as I see it,
in that great movie,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:84%
you had all the
basic characteristics

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.615 align:middle line:84%
of the witch, and
Dorothy, and you

00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:18.610 align:middle line:84%
had the Tin Man,
and the Scarecrow,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and the Lion, which
each represent

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
a principle of the human
nature, which would be

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.390 align:middle line:90%
like the courage for the Lion.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And for the Scarecrow, it
would be the intelligence.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And for the Tin Man, it would
be like the heart or the soul.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So many of those
things are important.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And within movies, and
in books, and in videos,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
we need to see what those
challenges are for us in life.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.497 align:middle line:84%
>> And so in your own book
here, what is the wizard?

00:02:48.497 --> 00:02:49.705 align:middle line:90%
How do you define the wizard?

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a wizard is a
person, because it's addressed

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:90%
to people.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a person that can
access inner magic.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.500 align:middle line:10%
And inner magic
would be the ability

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.530 align:middle line:10%
of tapping into your own
source, and to become

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.910 align:middle line:10%
a creator yourself.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:10%
So whenever you
achieve something,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:10%
whenever you break a
barrier that restrains you,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.660 align:middle line:10%
at one point, you
become a wizard

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:10%
because you are somebody
that seek out and go further

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:10%
than what was there
before you yourself

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.085 align:middle line:10%
and people representing you.

00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think it's important
for children to have mentors

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
to show them the
wizard within them?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because the children,
they possess this at a very

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:90%
high level.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And usually, what happened
during our life is that we are

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:84%
so much being ruled, and
restrained, and conditioned,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
that at one point, when you
become a full-grown person--

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:84%
when you're, let's
say, 20 to 25--

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
then you don't
recollect being a wizard

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
yourself, because
everything you have learned

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:84%
has been at one point
been conditioned.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.915 align:middle line:90%
>> You grew up in Canada.

00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:53.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And did you have many mentors
within your own life that

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
brought you to understand
the wizard within you?

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it was more
of a personal quest,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
because things happened to me
throughout my life since I was

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
a young kid.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I began
reading scientific texts.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:84%
All those kind of
articles that talks

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:84%
about the body,
the mind, the soul.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:90%
But today, we're in 1998.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.450 align:middle line:84%
There's not much 20
years ago that used

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:90%
to be printed on those matters.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:84%
There was some beginning of
understanding of evolution,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:90%
but not that much.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.030 align:middle line:90%
But I kept going and going.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
I began the book.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:90%
I was the book.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:90%
I realized that.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So I said, well, I have
to write it down and try

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to make some resonance
with other people,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and so they will
be able to read it,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and they will have their
own verification with what

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you feel like that most
of us have a book within us that

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:10%
needs to be written?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Most probably.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.910 align:middle line:84%
Each and everybody has
a unique experience.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing
is that if you

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.760 align:middle line:84%
have the ability of really
making the formulation

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and to write it down
into something--

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
a text that is very
understandable, then

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.560 align:middle line:84%
if you are really being able to
understand your own experience,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.330 align:middle line:84%
and you transfer
that, either you

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.280 align:middle line:84%
are a mother in your kitchen
and raising kids, at some level,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.720 align:middle line:84%
we each possess a
unique experience.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And if we are able to
transmit that to one another,

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
at one point, we'll
become better person.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.970 align:middle line:84%
So do you feel that,
actually, the books

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
that-- whether they're actually
written down like yours

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.140 align:middle line:84%
is, "The Wizard of Us,"
our lives are like books.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And so that we are living
that life of the book.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And how is it that
we can achieve

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.945 align:middle line:84%
a balance within that life of
this mind, body, and spirit?

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:58.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the thing is this,
is throughout our youth,

00:05:58.652 --> 00:06:00.610 align:middle line:84%
we are being-- like I
said-- a bit conditioned,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and we try to reach our
own maturity of adulthood.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
The only thing is that, when
you arrive at that point,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:84%
you are able to
look back what you

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
lived since the
beginning of your life.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, you can
try to deprogram yourself.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.430 align:middle line:84%
You can say, well, I lived that,
but it was not a happy moment.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And some people are doing
rebirths, and going back

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.970 align:middle line:84%
into a phase on
the mental level,

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.040 align:middle line:84%
just trying to access some
memories that were negative

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.880 align:middle line:84%
and try to reprogram them
and put them positive.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.472 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good way
of doing it, you know?

00:06:38.472 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You mention in your book that
our negative and our positive

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:84%
emotions can have a drastic
effect on our lives.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
you even said that,

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.910 align:middle line:84%
if a life is full of
negative emotions,

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that that is really what
leads us finally to--

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>> That kills you.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.530 align:middle line:90%
>> --our aging, and it kills us.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:84%
So one of the major
aspect I treat in my book

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
is-- like I say, I had
a major in biology.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And the way I was able to
observe, make observation

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.500 align:middle line:84%
of the human mankind, I was
able to draw this conclusion,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
saying that, if we are
able to shed ourselves

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.055 align:middle line:84%
from negative emotion
by being non-attached--

00:07:18.055 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
you know all those
books that are

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:84%
talking about the secret of
letting go, and non-attachment,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and things like that?

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:10%
They have understand
something the right way.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.060 align:middle line:84%
If you are not
attached, what happens

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is that you won't
be able to have

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.360 align:middle line:90%
all the rest that goes with it.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And at one point,
that would lead you

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:84%
to losing your energy by
adding negative emotion.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you are attached
either to an excess.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:84%
Either to money, or to
a consort, or something

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.300 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
At one point, you will be
able to live jealousy, envy,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And when you live those
negative emotions,

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.420 align:middle line:84%
then you are being drained
of your vital energy.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you're taking
some juice out of the battery.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, when
the battery's dead,

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
then you have to pass to
another dimension of living,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:84%
but without your physical
body, and come back

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
until you achieve, one day,
the ability of becoming

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.500 align:middle line:90%
pure spirit.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So the negative
emotions that we all feel,

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.910 align:middle line:84%
it's normal to have the negative
emotions, or it's not normal?

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's understandable.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's normal in the sense
that we are human nature.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:10%
So I think that
our goal is to try

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:10%
to transcend our human nature.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is that
it's normal to feel that.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But at one point,
if you become aware,

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.520 align:middle line:84%
you won't be able to live
what we call insecurity.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And then you won't
have the attachment,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and then you won't have
the negative emotion,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and then you won't have the
fear that lead to suffering.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's a
bit what's put forward

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.100 align:middle line:90%
in the Buddhist theory.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And they are not
far from reality,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.770 align:middle line:84%
because when you are almighty
knowing, at one point,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.360 align:middle line:84%
you understand so
well the situation

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.700 align:middle line:84%
that you won't have
the negative emotion,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and you will only
be able to have

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
the positive emotion,
which is linked to love,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and happiness, and the
blossoming of the soul,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:90%
and all those things.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.960 align:middle line:90%
Good values, as I can see.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.500 align:middle line:84%
If you want to take
just an example,

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
here, you probably have that
pink insulation during winter.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
If you don't insulate your
house quite the right way,

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
then money's flying out the
windows, because what happens

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.830 align:middle line:84%
is that you are
losing all your heat.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:84%
So if you know how
to isolate yourself

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.880 align:middle line:84%
from the negative emotion
by being non-attached,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:84%
what will happen if you
are able to transform that?

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Then all the energy
drain that you

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.302 align:middle line:84%
used to have will be transformed
and you will accumulate energy.

00:09:49.302 --> 00:09:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, you
will be able to transform

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.040 align:middle line:84%
your physical body into
a-- maturing into something

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.860 align:middle line:84%
else different that we
didn't really live through

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:90%
in the history of mankind.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So just as we are
abusing our energy sources,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:84%
even within the planet, you're
saying that we are also abusing

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
this source of energy, or
overusing this energy in bad

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
emotions rather than trying
to store up energy and use it

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.360 align:middle line:90%
for positive things.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in your own life, how
do you go about doing that?

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
If you were faced with
a negative situation,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.340 align:middle line:84%
or a negative person, how
do you manage to store up

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:90%
the energy to be positive?

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:10%
So one thing that I have to
just say is that, as I see it,

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.470 align:middle line:10%
there's no negative
things that really exist.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.650 align:middle line:10%
There are only experiences
that are technically

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:10%
imposed on me that
I would not wish,

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and that I have to live through.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And the key of all this
to have higher wisdom,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
and higher being of state, is to
be able to live those moments,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to defeat
the invisible enemy that

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:90%
will try to trash you down.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, it's like
if you go into a car dealer,

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.360 align:middle line:84%
you have the Toyota and
you have the Taurus.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, you
must win your inner battle

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.610 align:middle line:84%
into defeating whatever
is imposed on you.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And if your ability
to do this is great,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be in a
fast-evolving manner.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
at one point, you

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.730 align:middle line:84%
will become yourself
a creator because you

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:84%
will be able to tap
into your own energy,

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:40.770 align:middle line:84%
and you will be able to let
the wizard go, to set him free.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.345 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.345 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, in your book, you
talk a lot about the fact that

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:90%
the ego is at war, and that--

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
is it the wizard who
is overcoming the ego?

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a bit that.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
The thing is this, is the
wizard exists inside us,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.050 align:middle line:84%
and the ego is the
part of ourself--

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.230 align:middle line:90%
like I say in the book.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.660 align:middle line:10%
I make the analysis comparison
like with an iceberg.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
The ego part is
the little tip that

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.580 align:middle line:84%
goes out over this,
the level of the sea.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.400 align:middle line:84%
The real part of us,
the inner ourself,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:84%
are what are underneath
the level of the water.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.130 align:middle line:90%
So the thing is this.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
So we have an ego because we
have experience through life,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
through childhood and
growth, until we are adult,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.848 align:middle line:90%
a certain number of events.

00:12:30.848 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:10%
And some of them are
positive, some of them

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:10%
are negative, but in a
way that, at one point,

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:10%
if you are able to take this
wizard and beat the ego,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.077 align:middle line:10%
then you will be able
to become a new spirit.

00:12:43.077 --> 00:12:44.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're going
to take a little break,

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and when we come back, we'll
talk a little bit more about

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.100 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with this ego
and how to be more aware

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:90%
of the things in our life.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:54.892 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:12:54.892 --> 00:12:57.362 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:57.362 --> 00:13:00.098 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.098 --> 00:13:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Hello, and welcome back
to the "World of Wisdom."

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm Linda Rachel.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.010 align:middle line:84%
Today we have as our
guest Michel LabrÃ©che.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about
his new book here,

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and it's called
"The Wizard of Us."

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Michel, thank you for
coming to visit us.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.320 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I
think is very interesting about

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
your book is that you
speak of the many,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:26.050 align:middle line:84%
many things that we
have in our world now.

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
books to inform us.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
We have so much
information, that--

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.430 align:middle line:84%
it's more information
than we can ever take in.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about the
many, many subjects,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and how it's important to
be knowledgeable in all

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:90%
those areas.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But what is the most
important thing, you think,

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
know and learn as we

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.920 align:middle line:90%
move into the 21st century?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The most important thing
would be to be able to listen

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.680 align:middle line:10%
to yourself, because, as I
say, we all possess the answers

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.600 align:middle line:10%
to all the questions
we are able to ask.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's only in the manner
of asking the right question

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
by being able to observe
the right parameter.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you know how to
listen to yourself--

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and by doing that, you can try
to filter your mental thoughts.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So some people would do, let's
say, meditation, or yoga,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.440 align:middle line:84%
or things like that,
that would help them

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.350 align:middle line:90%
to be in peace with their mind.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, you will
be able to focus and to access

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
this energy that we are made
of, and that origin from what

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.770 align:middle line:84%
people call cosmic energy, or
God, or something like that.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So in other words, we need
to sometimes come back within

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.880 align:middle line:84%
All this information
is around us.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.870 align:middle line:84%
There are many people that
we could go and speak to,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.550 align:middle line:84%
and we'd be so
full of knowledge.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
But that inner wisdom really
comes from inside of us.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:14:59.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we understand
this difference?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of talk
about consciousness

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.560 align:middle line:90%
and unconsciousness.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.510 align:middle line:10%
How can we be more conscious
so that we live our lives

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:10%
in a loving manner,
and in a way that shows

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.850 align:middle line:10%
that we care about others?

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the thing is this,
is that consciousness,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:10%
you cannot really buy it.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:10%
You have to earn it
in a sense that you

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:10%
have to listen to yourself.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do
that, it's like there

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
will be a split inside
yourself, and the ego part

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:84%
will be one thing, and then
the spirit or the mind part

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:90%
will be something else.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:10%
Some people say, what is
somebody that is unconscious?

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:45.940 align:middle line:10%
And I say, listen.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Some people swept the
dust under the floor.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't see it,
then it doesn't exist.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's a bit what
I would call somebody

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.500 align:middle line:90%
who would be unconscious.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:10%
So the thing is this.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.550 align:middle line:10%
If you really know how
to access your own mind,

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:10%
and really feel the world,
feel with your heart,

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.830 align:middle line:10%
feel with your soul, and
feel with your spirit.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.380 align:middle line:84%
We have five senses, and
those five senses really

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.080 align:middle line:90%
inform us of our surroundings.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:84%
But there's a other
way to be able to tap

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:90%
into other dimensions.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.480 align:middle line:10%
We see from the infrared
to the ultraviolet,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.130 align:middle line:10%
but there are other worlds
living there that we cannot

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:10%
access.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So we have to listen.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe we can-- we
call this our intuition

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.020 align:middle line:90%
that is beyond our five senses?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.130 align:middle line:84%
The next level of
comprehension would be

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:90%
to be with a lot of intuition.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.610 align:middle line:84%
But further than
that, at one point,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
I see the human
quest for achievement

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.180 align:middle line:90%
into becoming pure spirit.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.740 align:middle line:84%
More than to have
only intuition,

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.230 align:middle line:84%
it's to be really
connected with the source,

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:84%
or what people
call God, and to be

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.560 align:middle line:84%
able to be creators of the mind,
of the body, and of the soul.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, what
will happen is that--

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:90%
like I say on the book--

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
the wizard has an
open palm of a hand.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:84%
And your inner reality is being
projected outside yourself.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.140 align:middle line:84%
So you're creating,
in your surroundings,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.020 align:middle line:90%
whatever you can achieve.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And then you will be able to
experience something that is

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:27.800 align:middle line:90%
very fantastic to live through.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And it will be linked to
compassion, and to sheer will,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.976 align:middle line:84%
and to very I awareness
or creativity.

00:17:34.976 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we are consciously
thinking thoughts that are

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
positive thoughts, that are
those thoughts that would help

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
mankind, that will be very--
we are creating that reality

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.785 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves
outside of ourselves.

00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> In your book, you talked
about several things.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You said that a person
who has real faith

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.110 align:middle line:84%
is someone that goes
beyond those five senses,

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:08.540 align:middle line:84%
and has a vision that is much
greater than those senses.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And you listed some
17 areas in which

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:14.720 align:middle line:84%
you said that we
should really have

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
some vision that would bring
us into this consciousness.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:21.363 align:middle line:84%
Wanted to talk to you a little
bit about some of those things.

00:18:21.363 --> 00:18:23.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the first
things you talked about

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.660 align:middle line:84%
is that we should
be more observant.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that, too many
times, we're too active in--

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're too much caught
up in our own life that we

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
spend our time trying
to earn our living.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, we are so
much entangled in life itself

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that one thing that
happens is, you are 70,

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.930 align:middle line:84%
you're 80 years old,
and you say, my God,

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die soon.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:84%
Is there something afterward--
the afterworld, or what?

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
So while you're
younger, you should

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.720 align:middle line:84%
be able to more try to
connect with your inside

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:90%
and feel the world, like I say.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you know how to
ask the right question,

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:84%
you will have the answer
because it's in the question.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I know they say
that we should stop and smell

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:10%
the flowers.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.090 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a part of it, is
being a little bit more aware

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on around you.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Actually seeing that other
person who's hurting,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and being able to feel
what they're going through.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, another area
that you talked about

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.320 align:middle line:84%
was that, to be infused
by the universal spirit.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.565 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:19:31.565 --> 00:19:32.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the thing is this.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we all are a part
of that primal spark that

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:90%
created the world.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And because we are
nourished by that energy,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:84%
if we knew how to
be enthused by that,

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.370 align:middle line:84%
we would really be able to
set our wizard free and become

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:50.630 align:middle line:90%
creators ourself.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
And you become like Picassos
or people like that.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.240 align:middle line:90%
Great creators in any field.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It can be science.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:90%
It can be art.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.090 align:middle line:90%
It can be anything.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Somebody that will
have intuition

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:07.550 align:middle line:84%
into creating something new
in any subject, any field.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So it doesn't matter
whether we're a biologist,

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.980 align:middle line:90%
whether a photographer.

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
our field of endeavor

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is, that if we are tuning into
that energy, that it makes

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:84%
us become everything that we
have the potential to become.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
We all have a personal
passion, or a personal talent.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we know
how to exploit it,

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.040 align:middle line:84%
we will be able to invent
new techniques or whatever

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:84%
that will make us special,
and that other person will

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.920 align:middle line:90%
be able to share this together.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you think that it's
possible to remain neutral--

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.780 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> We have to.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes it's very
difficult, but we have to.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:84%
The more we are positively
or negatively enhanced,

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.670 align:middle line:90%
we will react.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll probably have
a negative emotion,

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.752 align:middle line:84%
and then all the
rest will follow.

00:21:03.752 --> 00:21:05.960 align:middle line:84%
So the things that whenever
you live, and you undergo

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.800 align:middle line:84%
a special event
in your life, try

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:84%
to remain neutral and try
not to have a reaction to it.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:84%
And by just saying, what
really happened here?

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Like we were talking prior,
and we had some people saying,

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:90%
well, I saw angels.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.840 align:middle line:90%
I saw a spaceship, or whatever.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And some people will start a
religion after seeing an angel.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And the things that, what
really was the event,

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:34.520 align:middle line:90%
and try to remain neutral.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.320 align:middle line:90%
That's important.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's what happens
after that event,

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:84%
how it changes your life, how
you treat people after that.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.780 align:middle line:84%
There are many other things
that we could speak about

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.990 align:middle line:84%
within your book, but I
think one of the things

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.050 align:middle line:84%
that I thought was important
was the fact that you

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:90%
said we should forgive people.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this is something
that's difficult for us

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%
to do as human beings?

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:10%
The only thing is that if you
don't know how to forgive,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:10%
then you will be caught up
with a link with the person

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.020 align:middle line:10%
you don't want to forgive.

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:84%
And then the link will
create something inside,

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:90%
and will eat you up inside.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So when I say you
have to forgive,

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.050 align:middle line:84%
is that if somebody makes
you angry or whatever,

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.890 align:middle line:84%
or there's a negative event
coming to you, to that person,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.300 align:middle line:90%
then you have to let go.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And let go means remain
neutral, but at one

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.680 align:middle line:90%
point, to have no attachment.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
know how to forgive,

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:90%
then you will be linked.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it will create
something very bad

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:90%
inside yourself.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for joining us.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.330 align:middle line:90%
Hope you'll come back soon.

00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for joining
us, you our viewers,

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.688 align:middle line:84%
and we hope that you'll come
back to the "World of Wisdom."

00:22:41.688 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
