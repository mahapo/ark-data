00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Are you really doing what
you want to do with your life?

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:10%
Has it ever occurred to
you that you may have

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:10%
a special calling or passion?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:10%
I am Marilyn McGuire and
this is the Wisdom Channel.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.730 align:middle line:10%
We are talking today with
Justine and Michael Toms,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:10%
co-authors of the
book, "True Work--

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.390 align:middle line:10%
The Sacred Dimension
of Earning a Living."

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Justine, welcome
to Wisdom Channel.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> So good to be here, Marilyn.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.150 align:middle line:10%
Can you tell us
what is true work?

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, true work is really
listening to your inner voice

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:10%
and following your passion,
finding that which has meaning

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:10%
for you, and manifesting
that in the world.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether you earn a living with
it or not is another question.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:84%
But we really need
to follow our passion

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and find our gifts that we are
here to give, and to give them.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.630 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, from your point of
view, how has your life--

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.310 align:middle line:10%
how have you followed
your passion,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:10%
or have you discovered your
passion, is the main thing.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.900 align:middle line:10%
And then when you
do, how do you know

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:10%
it's really your passion
and really your service?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.715 align:middle line:90%
And how do you follow it?

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, for me-- and
it's going to be different from

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.220 align:middle line:90%
Michael--

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
but for me, it came rather
slowly and unfolded.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But when Michael and
I first got together,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.140 align:middle line:84%
we started going to all
these seminars and workshops

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
about new thought and new
ideas of looking at the world.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:90%
And we got so excited about it.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:84%
We decided that we would like
to do something in the media.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:10%
Because none of
it at that time--

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.539 align:middle line:10%
this was more than
25 years ago--

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:10%
was appearing in the media about
meditation or holistic health

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.520 align:middle line:10%
or alternative health,
nothing about the way babies

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.440 align:middle line:10%
are born, like in
birthing rooms.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And everything was like in
like an emergency in a surgery

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:29.970 align:middle line:90%
or something.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
So all of these new ideas were
coming in and we got so excited

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
we decided to start
something called--

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> 25 years ago?

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.450 align:middle line:90%
>> 25 years ago.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's called New Dimensions.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.548 align:middle line:84%
And it became a radio program,
which has now aired all over

00:02:43.548 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:84%
the world-- all over the
United States and now all over

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:90%
the world--

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.790 align:middle line:90%
talking about these ideas.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So we just started by being
excited about the ideas

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and just starting with
what we called baby steps

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.660 align:middle line:90%
and just started to do it.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.050 align:middle line:90%
Just held some lectures.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And out of the lectures came
an invitation to do radio.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:90%
And then it just kept unfolding.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's been
a lifelong learning.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It's been something
that has kept

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.420 align:middle line:90%
me interested for 25 years.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's what true work is.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
We didn't go into it
for earning a living.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.630 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even think about that
until it just kept working.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.060 align:middle line:84%
We would subsidize it
for many, many years.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was an all volunteer
organization for many years.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And then as we just kept
doing it with our enthusiasm,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
with giving it
attention, it just

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.450 align:middle line:84%
developed into something
that now, actually,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:90%
is full time for us.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:10%
>> I want to come back to
talking about New Dimensions

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.030 align:middle line:10%
radio.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:90%
But you mentioned baby steps.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's
really-- you know,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
we have to start with
something that's close to us.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Because when we are
following our passion

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.750 align:middle line:84%
or following that
inner voice, at first

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.480 align:middle line:90%
it might be a small voice.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And we might say, oh, I
don't know if I can do it.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.390 align:middle line:10%
Our vision might be large.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:90%
How do you, how do you start it?

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, you start it with
first, what is close to us.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
You start with maybe talking
about it with your friends who

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.850 align:middle line:90%
are very supportive.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to have
friends who are supportive,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:84%
who support you in
all of your fullness.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:84%
So to start off with
something like that.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.835 align:middle line:84%
And maybe like the way we
started New Dimensions,

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:84%
we said, well, what
are we going to do.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.330 align:middle line:84%
We rented a space
in the local church.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And we invited some
people to speak.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And we put a little
ad in the newspaper.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.910 align:middle line:90%
And people came.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And we had a little shoe
box to collect some,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:90%
I think $3 at the door.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:10%
And we had a little
mailing list that they

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:10%
want to know about more.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:90%
Now those are baby steps.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Now that mailing list of
those first maybe 25 people

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that came to that
first lecture has

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.620 align:middle line:84%
developed into 60,000
name mailing list

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
that's kept on computer now.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you had
thought about that, how

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:84%
are we going to get 60,000
names on a computer at first,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:90%
it would just stop you.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.780 align:middle line:10%
But if you say, oh, we
just invite a few people

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:10%
and we build from that,
and you build from that,

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.500 align:middle line:10%
and those are baby steps.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:10%
Those little steps that we
talk about that are connected,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:10%
one on the other, the next step
will lead you to the next step.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fascinating.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And what comes to
mind for me is,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.200 align:middle line:84%
in following your
passion along the way,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.005 align:middle line:84%
do you have a goal
out there in mind,

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
or are you just being
led by your passion

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to what will become a goal
that might surprise you

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:90%
when it comes?

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
a great question,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.040 align:middle line:90%
because it's about the end.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.960 align:middle line:90%
There is a goal.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:90%
There's an overall vision.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's very, very
important to hold it loosely.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it allows for what
we call magic to happen.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And when we talk
about magic, it's

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
more like when you are really
energized by your vision,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:84%
then it allows the
unexpected to come in.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you hold your
vision so rigidly

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's just going
to be this way,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
then that unexpected
can't really come.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:10%
So you need to hold it loosely.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:10%
Let it flow.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:10%
But you have an
overall vision or goal.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But let it, let it have
room to move and to breathe

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and to grow.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.160 align:middle line:84%
If we had imagined New
Dimensions as it is now,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
in the very beginning, well,
it was beyond our imagination

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
that we would be
worldwide broadcasting.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.820 align:middle line:84%
We knew overall that
we wanted to talk

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.220 align:middle line:84%
about life-enhancing,
empowering visions in the world

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and bring people on who
were following this path.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:84%
But other than that, we
really held it loosely.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, today, after
25 years of this,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
can you describe New Dimensions
radio to those people who may

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.830 align:middle line:90%
not know about it?

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh I'd love to.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're a weekly
program that's

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.570 align:middle line:84%
on about 300 stations
across the United States.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And it airs on shortwave out of
Europe and Australia and Costa

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.330 align:middle line:90%
Rica.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.310 align:middle line:10%
>> And every week we invite
someone on who is manifesting

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.410 align:middle line:10%
some positive vision in
the world, something--

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.580 align:middle line:10%
and it could be about anything
from health to psychology,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.660 align:middle line:10%
from spirituality to, from
I like to say from birthing

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.120 align:middle line:10%
babies to going out into space.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's people who
are doing something

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
in their life that is coming up
with solutions for the future,

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
for the betterment of all
life, that enhances our ability

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
to be together in community,
that enhances our ability

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
to be with ourselves, to
accept and love ourselves,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:84%
to love each other more,
and to work in a better

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:90%
environment all the way around.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And you had no idea that
this big thing was coming?

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we had no idea.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle line:84%
We just had this enthusiasm for
the ideas that we were hearing.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
And we just kept following
it, following it.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the point, that
following is the baby steps

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:10%
leading the way.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, along the way,
was it always easy going?

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, Marilyn.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you
follow your vision--

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
I know that years ago we
did many, many interviews

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.900 align:middle line:84%
with Joseph Campbell,
the famous mythologist.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And he would often talk
about following your bliss.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, people misinterpret
that thinking it's

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:90%
all going to be blissful.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.220 align:middle line:84%
But he talks about
following your bliss

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
as going down, going
to where the shadow

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.400 align:middle line:90%
side is, where the compost is.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.620 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's
really, you're going

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.830 align:middle line:10%
to learn a lot of
lessons on this path.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going
to always feel easy.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to
always feel enjoyable.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But when you are doing
what has meaning for you,

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
you can always revert back
to, oh, why you're doing it.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to do
that, to take time out

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.580 align:middle line:90%
to think, why am I doing this.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:10%
When the going gets tough, when
maybe the money isn't coming in

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.320 align:middle line:10%
or maybe all the details
are not working out,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:10%
there are always
going to be details.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we have to
learn to be in the present

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:90%
and to have a single focus.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So how is it having a
partnership with a husband,

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:10%
a husband and wife
team working together?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, that's been wonderful.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.390 align:middle line:84%
I think because
Michael and I, we

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.400 align:middle line:84%
have something that
we're working on that's

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:90%
bigger than the two of us.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when we
got together, we always

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:84%
thought that we
would have children,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.825 align:middle line:84%
although we both had children
from former relationships.

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:10%
We thought that we
would have children.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:10%
And it just kind
of never happened.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.940 align:middle line:10%
And then through the years,
as we look back on it,

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.310 align:middle line:10%
we realized that
really, about nine

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.360 align:middle line:10%
months after we got together,
we started New Dimensions.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.670 align:middle line:10%
And here it is going on.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:90%
And now it's grown up.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be
our creation together.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a
wonderful creation.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That is very, very touching.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.860 align:middle line:10%
Thank you, Justine.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm Marilyn McGuire and you are
watching the Wisdom Channel.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:10%
We have been talking to
Justine Toms about her book,

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:10%
"True Work--

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.092 align:middle line:10%
The Sacred Dimension of Earning
a Living," that she co-authored

00:10:53.092 --> 00:10:55.517 align:middle line:10%
with her husband, Michael Toms.

00:10:55.517 --> 00:10:56.642 align:middle line:10%
We'll be back with Michael.

00:10:56.642 --> 00:10:57.606 align:middle line:10%
Stay with us.

00:10:57.606 --> 00:11:03.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.280 align:middle line:10%
This is Marilyn McGuire.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.130 align:middle line:10%
And we are talking to
Michael and Justine Toms

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:10%
today about their
book, "True Work--

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.090 align:middle line:10%
The Sacred Dimension
of Earning a Living."

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.533 align:middle line:10%
I'd like to introduce
Michael Toms.

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Marilyn.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.250 align:middle line:90%
Nice to be here.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It is nice to see you.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, Justine who said
her feelings about true work.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you must
feel similar to it.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
But since you've
both wrote the book,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:84%
give me, tell us
about your idea.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:10%
>> I think true work is an
expression of our following

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:10%
our passion for
the last 25 years.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.120 align:middle line:10%
And so it reflects
some of the principles

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:10%
that we've learned and have put
into practice over those years,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.760 align:middle line:10%
as well as our
passion is talking

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.132 align:middle line:10%
to other people about
their passion in the work

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:51.840 align:middle line:10%
that we do on the
radio and the dialogues

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.328 align:middle line:10%
that we have on the radio.

00:11:53.328 --> 00:11:54.870 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked to
many, many people,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really
thousands of people,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.970 align:middle line:84%
over 3,000 people, many of whom
are following their passion.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And we've picked up a few
pointers along the way.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So the book is
expressive of not only

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:84%
our own grounded
practical experience,

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
but the experience
of many others

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.040 align:middle line:84%
about what following
your passion is all about

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.780 align:middle line:90%
and what we call true work.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Following your passion, like
everyone has a mission in life,

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.500 align:middle line:90%
perhaps, that they need to find.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think everyone,
particularly in these times

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:84%
with this kind of bottom line
business as usual mentality,

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
that something is being
trampled in the process.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And that something essential
is that deep longing

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.200 align:middle line:84%
that all of us have to give our
gifts, to make a contribution,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:90%
to be of service.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:90%
I think everyone has that.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really important
that we give those gifts.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.500 align:middle line:84%
Because each of
us is an original.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:90%
We're unique.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:90%
And we have gifts to offer.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And so as we give them, the
world becomes a better place.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.075 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I mean by
following your passion.

00:12:57.075 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
to follow your passion,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.615 align:middle line:90%
whatever it may be.

00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle line:10%
Well, my passion is
clearly my work, the work

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.612 align:middle line:10%
that I do on the radio.

00:13:03.612 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
But I have other
passions, as well.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.230 align:middle line:84%
My grandchildren are
a passion for me.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Birds are a passion for me.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.678 align:middle line:84%
I have bird feeders all
over around our house.

00:13:10.678 --> 00:13:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And every morning I get
up and go feed the birds.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.322 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great way
to start the day.

00:13:15.322 --> 00:13:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And so I have other passions.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Reading is a passion.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:90%
I love books.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I have 30 or 40 books
by my bed, you know?

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:90%
And I'm reading all of them.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:90%
Because I love books.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:90%
And so that's a passion.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.583 align:middle line:84%
So many of us have,
we all have passions.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.000 align:middle line:10%
And it's important
to follow them,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:10%
to make them a
priority in our life.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, all too often we
get caught in the fast lane

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
and all we're
doing is busyness--

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.490 align:middle line:90%
busy, busy, busy.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
We never get in the off
ramp to enjoy our passions.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's only by doing that
that we can really feed our soul

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.740 align:middle line:84%
and nurture our soul and
have real joy in our life.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>> This sounds very exciting.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.360 align:middle line:84%
There's also a bit of
a scary aspect to it.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's exciting because it
comes from that deep place

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:01.500 align:middle line:84%
in ourselves that is
exciting and is motivational.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.910 align:middle line:90%
It's energizing.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And so when we follow our
passion, it is energizing.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.570 align:middle line:90%
We get joy from it.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's not always easy.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:90%
It's an adventure.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like
jumping into the abyss.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:90%
We've got to take the leap.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And we go into the
unknown where we

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.427 align:middle line:84%
have to let go of what we
know and what we are used to.

00:14:18.427 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's the place
where creativity can really

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
happen because we have
to give up the known.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.368 align:middle line:84%
So chaos is really a
great place, Marilyn.

00:14:26.368 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I never thought
about it that way.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.720 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have a
lot of it in my life.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's a blessing.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
When we're in chaos,
it's a blessing.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it is.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.470 align:middle line:10%
Ans as Justine
spoke about, I know

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:10%
that there are baby
steps along the way,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:10%
as well as a lot
of ups and downs.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And have there been any
special turning points for you

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.420 align:middle line:90%
along your way?

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:84%
One of the turning points in
my life was meeting Justine.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.558 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a major
turning point for me.

00:14:53.558 --> 00:14:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Because I was in the advertising
business before I met Justine.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And I always knew that
my career in advertising

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:90%
would be short term.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:02.450 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I enjoyed it.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:90%
I was a great copywriter.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:90%
I loved doing that.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And yet I knew all the time
this was not my life's work.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And I knew at some point
I would give it up.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
When I met Justine,
within a couple months

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.630 align:middle line:90%
I was ready to give it up.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It was time.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I left the
advertising business.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:84%
We bought a camper and
intended to travel around

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:90%
the United States for a year.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:90%
We made it for 3 and 1/2 months.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:90%
And it was a great trip.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It was wonderful.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And we've been
together ever since.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.200 align:middle line:84%
But that clearly changed
my life at that point.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a wonderful thing.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.330 align:middle line:90%
This was a very positive thing.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Had there been other
things that have

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
been kind of depressing
to you or made

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.980 align:middle line:84%
you feel that you weren't
on the right path.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a situation that
was extremely challenging

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:90%
and stressful.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.890 align:middle line:84%
One of those was when we got
canceled by our main station

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the '70s, we were
just in Northern California.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And the station that we were
on, we were on Saturday nights.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.630 align:middle line:90%
We had a four hour live program.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:90%
We were on for six years.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We were the most listened
to program on that station

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:84%
and most popular program on
Public Radio in the Bay Area.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:90%
And they canceled it.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Just one day they
said we were gone.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were
changing their format.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And so we were left high
and dry without our station,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.957 align:middle line:84%
without our audience,
our support.

00:16:19.957 --> 00:16:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was almost
the death, you know,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.623 align:middle line:84%
it's like we were hearing
the death knell ringing.

00:16:23.623 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:90%
The bell was ringing.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And that was a major
turning point there.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Either we went out of business
and we found something else

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:90%
to do or we kept it going.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, somehow, just
through the graces

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that were happening at the
time, we kept it together.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:10%
And we were able to--

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:10%
it was right at the same
time, within a few months

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:10%
the Public Broadcasting
satellite was being installed

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.860 align:middle line:10%
to be available to public radio
stations around the country.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:10%
And so we basically were
able to put together

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.950 align:middle line:10%
some programs for that.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And within a few months,
within maybe six months or so,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:84%
we were at the first conference,
first Public Radio conference

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.730 align:middle line:84%
where the satellite
was actually-- the day

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:90%
was the vernal equinox in 1980.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.050 align:middle line:90%
It was the spring equinox.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
We were in Kansas City at
the Public Radio conference.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And our program was being beamed
on the satellite at that time.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.113 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple
of months of that,

00:17:18.113 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
we had 100 stations
that said they

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.119 align:middle line:90%
wanted to carry New Dimensions.

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:23.795 align:middle line:10%
So suddenly we had a national
audience and we were national.

00:17:23.795 --> 00:17:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And that made all
the difference.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.369 align:middle line:90%
And we went on.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And so that seeming
tragedy at the time,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.023 align:middle line:84%
which really put
us on a real downer

00:17:32.023 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and looked like the destruction,
the potential destruction

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of our work, turned
into a real blessing.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Because it forced us into a
situation where we had to say,

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.362 align:middle line:84%
well, you know, we need
to do something else.

00:17:44.362 --> 00:17:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we did.

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So we suddenly realized
that one station was not

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.530 align:middle line:90%
going to make it for us.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't make it because
we were left without--

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
so we had to have
multiple stations.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.210 align:middle line:84%
So we went national
and it worked.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> So you just kept your faith.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.360 align:middle line:90%
You kept persevering.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:90%
And you did not give up.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:90%
It was this idea--

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, think about it.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the ideas and topics
and people we talked to

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.270 align:middle line:90%
are people on the margins.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.830 align:middle line:90%
They're on the cutting edge.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:90%
They're not in the mainstream.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And we built that
network during the '80s,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.700 align:middle line:84%
during the Reagan era,
which was a very kind

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:84%
of revisionist era going
back to conservative ideas.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the ideas
were not in that milieu.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.430 align:middle line:84%
But we built a network
during that time.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.890 align:middle line:84%
Now we have over 300 stations
that carry our program

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.490 align:middle line:84%
So we were basically
going up river,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.410 align:middle line:90%
against the tide at the time.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
But still, you know, deep
underneath the surface

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:36.970 align:middle line:84%
there's been a real
hunger, I think,

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.970 align:middle line:84%
in our society in
America for the spiritual

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:45.175 align:middle line:84%
and for a deeper message, one
that is hopeful and grounded.

00:18:45.175 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's that message
that we try and deliver

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:48.550 align:middle line:90%
on the airwaves.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard Jean Houston say,
mention that we're telling

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.460 align:middle line:84%
stories for people who are
looking for the new story.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.010 align:middle line:90%
We're providing a curriculum.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me
that you have certainly

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:04.060 align:middle line:84%
been providing a curriculum
for the many, many people that

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.800 align:middle line:84%
are looking for a new story
about life and how it can be.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why it's so
exciting to have New Dimensions

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:15.040 align:middle line:84%
radio hookup with the Wisdom
Network and the Wisdom Channel,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom Radio because you know,
Bill Turner's idea of a 24-hour

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
life-affirming television
channel and radio network is

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:90%
a great idea.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And a new dimension.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And a new dimension
for New Dimensions.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And we're really happy
to be part of it.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's really an idea
whose time has come.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Because clearly when, you know--

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.065 align:middle line:90%
you and I both travel a lot.

00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:37.190 align:middle line:84%
When I go into a city and
I turn on the television,

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.648 align:middle line:84%
it's always amazing to me, you
know, you go in these cities

00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:43.180 align:middle line:84%
they have 60 or 70 choices, 60
or 70 choices on the television

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:90%
and there's nothing to watch.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.670 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing worth seeing.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So the Wisdom Channel, I
think, is a real blessing

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:84%
and a real important step
in this vast wasteland

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.170 align:middle line:90%
of commercial television.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> I totally agree with you.

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.820 align:middle line:84%
Didn't you have a
big career change

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.230 align:middle line:90%
at some point along the way?

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:90%
It seems I read.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:05.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I worked for
a major corporation,

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.050 align:middle line:84%
multinational corporation
for eight years in marketing

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:90%
and communication.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I was on
the career track.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately for me-- and
I didn't know it at the time,

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:90%
really--

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.210 align:middle line:84%
that I found my ladder
against the wrong wall

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.860 align:middle line:90%
and moved the ladder.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a Joe Campbell
metaphor, actually.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.510 align:middle line:84%
For me, it happened because
I was a little dense.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.053 align:middle line:84%
I had to be pushed off
the edge of the cliff.

00:20:31.053 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And the way I got
pushed off was I

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:84%
was about to be married, not
to Justine, my present wife,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:90%
but to someone else.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And within a few days of being
married she called it off.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:90%
And invitations--

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Justine?

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:84%
>> She was someone
else, not Justine.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it really, my
whole world that I had

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.610 align:middle line:90%
created at that point crashed.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And it was a real downer.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I went into a
deep depression, suicidal.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.680 align:middle line:10%
And it was very, very black
and bleak at the time.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.240 align:middle line:10%
And somehow, through grace and
blessings, I came out of that

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:10%
and quit my job, my career
job and didn't really know

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:09.530 align:middle line:10%
what I was going to do.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But then what I
did was I basically

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.330 align:middle line:84%
created a personal
sabbatical for myself,

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
although I didn't really know
I was doing it at the time.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.590 align:middle line:90%
I just felt compelled to do it.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a deeply--

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
the time for me was a deeply
spiritual and transformational

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And I just did, I walked in the
park and did a lot of reading.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned how to
meditate and just

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.690 align:middle line:84%
had some amazing things
happen during that time.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And that led me,
amazingly enough,

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.290 align:middle line:90%
into the advertising business.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.660 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual opening
led me to advertising.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of the great
masters have taken their time

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.638 align:middle line:90%
in the wilderness.

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's really important
to take sabbaticals,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:52.300 align:middle line:84%
whether they be a year,
whether they be a half a day

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.343 align:middle line:90%
or an hour.

00:21:53.343 --> 00:21:54.760 align:middle line:84%
It's important to
take sabbaticals

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.380 align:middle line:90%
from what we are doing.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I call them mini
spiritual retreats.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.223 align:middle line:84%
And we should do that
as much as possible.

00:22:01.223 --> 00:22:02.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is
part of true work--

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Part of true work.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Knowing that that's
important to do.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the only time we can
really listen to our inner

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.290 align:middle line:90%
voice.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I think so many people that
are seeking their true work

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
or are not in touch with their
true work could benefit from

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:16.370 align:middle line:90%
knowing that.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.587 align:middle line:84%
>> That it's
important to do that.

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:84%
I know the Oriental
people sometimes will--

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Get out of the fast
lane to the off ramp.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And the European people
will frequently do this.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, working as a team,
as a husband and wife team,

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.800 align:middle line:90%
how has this been for you?

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been amazingly inspiring
and energizing and great.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I've loved it.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you
very much, Michael Tom.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>> This is Marilyn McGuire.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And you are watching
the Wisdom Channel.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:10%
