Sasha, to his friends--

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.890 align:middle line:84%
is nothing less
than the godfather

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.270 align:middle line:84%
of psychopharmacology, an
expert on the cyclocized

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
phenethylamines,
that is, psychoactive

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.470 align:middle line:84%
compounds useful in
the emotional recovery

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.630 align:middle line:90%
of traumatic events.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Shulgin has given his life to
the study of the pharmacology

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:90%
of the psychedelic experience.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.520 align:middle line:84%
In Prague, he told me,
"greater frontiers lie ahead."

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
The next lost continent to be
explored by Alexander Shulgin,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.960 align:middle line:90%
the psychoactive tryptamines.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Sasha suggested that I join him
for a stroll among the graves

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
of the cemetery of the
Jewish Ghetto of Prague,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.430 align:middle line:90%
Europe's oldest ghetto.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.780 align:middle line:84%
There, walking among the stones,
we reminisced and speculated

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.506 align:middle line:84%
about the history and the
future of psychopharmacology.

What do you make of your
Russian colleagues here?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm fascinated
by what he's doing,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and I am intrigued by his
ability to get out what he is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.710 align:middle line:84%
doing into the West because the
status of a physician record is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
not what we have come
to respect in the West.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.396 align:middle line:84%
>> You're talking about
Yevgeny Trepinski--

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:40.196 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I imagine you don't
view ketamine with--

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:90%
well, how do you view ketamine?

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a-- it's an anesthetic
and it's a dissociative thing.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And it puts me out of body.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very dissociative.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.350 align:middle line:90%
It puts me out of mind.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Just, you're away.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And I, frankly, with a full
bladder, like being here.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.314 align:middle line:84%
And you suddenly realize that
someone has a full bladder,

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
and there's only one
intellectual level.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:90%
You realize it's you.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.805 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, yes.

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
No, it's seriously
disassociated me

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that I felt it was a great
victory when I finally

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:90%
realized that this was a drug.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, I couldn't
figure out what it was

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
or who was even
asking the question.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We kept calling it Vitamin
K, which is a fascinating

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.500 align:middle line:84%
euphemism for allowing-- to
have some symptoms of a food

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
additive for a
dietary supplement.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I think--

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I had the interesting
pleasure of being back at a big

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.300 align:middle line:84%
company in the East the day
they had bought the rights

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.130 align:middle line:90%
to distribute ketamine.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I informed
them, you do realize

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.458 align:middle line:84%
that ketamine is being
made by Park Davis

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:50.172 align:middle line:90%
and shipped off to Mexico.

00:02:50.172 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's imported in gallon--

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
not gallon, but liter
bottles, all with a percentage

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.990 align:middle line:90%
of preservative.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And it comes right
back into California

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.900 align:middle line:90%
in the trunk of the car.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Oh, about 20 years
ago, there was

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
a class of compounds
called quinuclidines.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.132 align:middle line:84%
And for about three
of four years,

00:03:07.132 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I just noticed that
there's no publishing

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
in the Russian
literature whatsoever

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:90%
on the quinuclidines.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Then, all of a sudden, the
Russian literature here

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
started publishing, and
then we went into a--

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:90%
sort of a gap.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.386 align:middle line:84%
And then quinuclidine
benzylate, which

00:03:22.386 --> 00:03:25.020 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most potent
of the anticholinergics,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.550 align:middle line:84%
was suddenly revealed that the
Russians were working on it

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.439 align:middle line:90%
as a chemical warfare agent.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And then we were working
on it as a defense

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
against their chemical
warfare agent.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And it was active--active
10, 20 micrograms.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.556 align:middle line:90%
>> 10, 20 micrograms.

00:03:37.556 --> 00:03:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Micrograms, yeah.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
It make you really wonky,
just like atropine.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.815 align:middle line:90%
Delusion, confusion.

00:03:43.815 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:84%
>> But they designed these
fantastic bombs that they can

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
explode and send out millions
of little hypodermic needles.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't have
to worry about wind

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.850 align:middle line:90%
blowing it downwind or upwind.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's essentially a
chemical cluster bomb of some

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.050 align:middle line:90%
sort.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Cluster bomb, but with
little hypodermic needles.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's probably
in the inventory.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.626 align:middle line:84%
>> It's already
in the inventory.

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, I-- someone
mentioned to me

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
that you had
expressed interest now

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.529 align:middle line:84%
that you felt you had sort
of done the work you wanted

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
to do with cyclocized
phenethylamines

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:84%
and that you were going back
to looking at tryptamines.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Very much so.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the other
side of the coin.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
There's this rich and
unexplored areas of Netherlands

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.870 align:middle line:90%
were 20 years ago.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So are you going to
illuminate it for us, and--

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.070 align:middle line:84%
I've already made the
t-butyl, t-butyl methyl.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Isopropyl methyl is well-known,
but the secondary butyl methyl

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.180 align:middle line:90%
is not known.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.810 align:middle line:90%
They're all active by smoking.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And what-- are they--

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.840 align:middle line:84%
could do, in a blind test,
pick one out from another?

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Or are they sort of--

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't know yet.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't know yet.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.529 align:middle line:90%
I doubt it, somehow.

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:84%
I think they're all going to be
fast, impactful, and all very

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:90%
much like DMT.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Duration-wise, or--

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Duration-wise.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --presentationally.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And probably, perhaps,
a little bit more potent.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>> A little bit more potent?

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.423 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because DMT is
not that all fired potent.

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.370 align:middle line:84%
It takes, you know,
10, 20, 50-- no, more--

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:90%
50, 100 milligrams.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.129 align:middle line:90%
>> 50 to 70 milligrams.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:11.928 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And some of these, we're
getting into, maybe, at 30--

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:90%
20 to 30 milligrams.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:90%
But not active orally.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.942 align:middle line:84%
We have to get up to a
certain degree of shrubbery,

00:05:20.942 --> 00:05:22.650 align:middle line:84%
on the knife, when
you get oral activity.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And how many of these
compounds do you imagine there

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.830 align:middle line:90%
are that are simple variants?

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> At, casually, you
could make 30, 40, 50.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you suppose it
is that this fast-acting,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.940 align:middle line:84%
easily manufactured, spectacular
hallucinogen is so rarely met

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:90%
in the underground?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that there is--
it's there, in some quantity.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
I heard about a
seizure in Boston,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe, it was of ayahuasca
And they seized it on the basis

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:90%
that it contained DMT.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
That was the Santo
Daime people--

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.000 align:middle line:90%
>> --from Brazil.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Brazil.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But, you know, we live in a
society where people jump out

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:84%
of airplanes and hang by
bungee cords over bridges.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
And DMT, which is always
described as a easy synthesis--

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Extremely easy.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.075 align:middle line:90%
>> --is just not--

00:06:22.075 --> 00:06:22.875 align:middle line:90%
not there.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:23.675 align:middle line:90%
It's--

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I have no idea.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It violates one of
these economic laws of--

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Basic laws of--

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Gresham or
Graham or somebody.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Something that I've always
wanted to ask you, which is,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.080 align:middle line:84%
unlike me, you seem
remarkably resistant to what

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I call the implications.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how can you just do
these things over and over

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.110 align:middle line:84%
again and not be
nutty as a fruit cake?

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, are you?

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Are you?

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm relaxed
at any event.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But, unlike me, you don't
feel the need to rave about

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:90%
that aspect of it?

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Not particularly.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather quietly
stay half in the closet

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
and continue to
doing what I'm doing.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> But you do--

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.170 align:middle line:84%
you've probably seen more
uncharted internal landscape

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
than half of mankind
put together.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would not
be an immodest claim.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:84%
>> They're a little
bit charted now.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, a very little bit.

00:07:28.882 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Very little, that's right.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
But the seeds are there
to be used by anyone else.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
That's the reason
for the book, just

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:84%
to get it all recorded
into a documented form.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> But it always puzzles me.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think Hoffman
and Wasson and, certainly,

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:90%
to some degree, Schultes--

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.590 align:middle line:90%
to some degree, you--

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.720 align:middle line:84%
nobody want-- everybody
says, well, I'm

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.615 align:middle line:84%
just a humble botanist or I'm
just a hard-working workbench

00:07:55.615 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle line:90%
chemist.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants to
actually say, this

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.410 align:middle line:90%
must be very, very important.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's so uniquely
beyond ordinary expectation.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but the importance
is going to take a long time

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.090 align:middle line:90%
to realize.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:84%
What you can't build
without the tools,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have the tools,
and these are the tools that

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:90%
allow the building to be done.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:21.743 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a builder.

00:08:21.743 --> 00:08:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm a toolmaker.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's probably
one of the reasons

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I have not described a
lot of the landscapes.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't see them differently.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:38.950 align:middle line:84%
>> If we could compare it to
the invention of the telescope,

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.990 align:middle line:84%
probably within 50 years of
the invention of the telescope,

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the major solar system new
paradigms were put in place.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:90%
This seems very elusive.

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
It seems hard for us to go
beyond simply saying it exists,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:90%
it's really far out.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:90%
And then we sort of fall silent.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.197 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:06.655 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the
silence is, in part,

00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
imposed upon us by a very
unsympathetic authority body.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.240 align:middle line:90%
And maybe it's just as well.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Because, that way,
a lot of work can

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
be done and sort of
recorded for posterity.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And the time the pendulum
swing, they all swing back.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And the time will come when
this work will be used--

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
research will be done
with these tools that

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.960 align:middle line:90%
will be of great value.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, obviously, you
believe in it strongly.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
What would you say
to a critic who said,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:90%
what's so great about this?

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Are you and your friends
in any significant way

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
different from the
rest of humanity?

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.762 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:47.762 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And I don't see why
it would be critical.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not offending him.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:84%
I can see no way in that
which I'm offending him.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm quietly doing my little
alchemist thing at home.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But you really must think
that it does make a difference.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it does.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.492 align:middle line:90%
I think it will.

00:10:03.492 --> 00:10:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It will.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:06.610 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think it does now.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.764 align:middle line:84%
>> So we really are cursed
with being pioneers.

00:10:10.764 --> 00:10:11.728 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:12.528 align:middle line:90%
I like it.

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not so bad.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:13.910 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not so bad.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.066 align:middle line:90%
>> It has a nice feel to it.

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, they'll hang your
picture in the main hall years

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
hence and say,
these were giants.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I would rather have my
picture hanging in the main

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.110 align:middle line:84%
hall than me hanging
in the main hall.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, some
people manage both.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Both.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:31.770 align:middle line:90%
That's true.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And you may end
up that way too.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.420 align:middle line:90%
It's a short, happy life.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of neat.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:38.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you've--

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.800 align:middle line:84%
>> But this is
your territory too.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.633 align:middle line:90%
What's your feeling?

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel that that's
a fair feeling, or--

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:50.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that I have always,
from the very first psychedelic

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
experience, had the uncanny
intuition that, yes,

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
this has been around
for 50,000 years,

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
but it's somehow going to
be critically important

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:90%
in our lifetime.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.320 align:middle line:84%
That we will need
it for something,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.370 align:middle line:84%
maybe just to think
our way out of the mess

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:90%
that we're getting into.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, OK.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.545 align:middle line:90%
But if it's needed, we have it.

00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:18.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's the beauty.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.700 align:middle line:84%
The tool is there for the
time when the need is obvious.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And this may be-- it
may be our lifetime.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So, essentially, what you're
doing is you're placing tools

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.620 align:middle line:90%
on the shelf--

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.782 align:middle line:84%
screwdrivers for screws that
haven't been invented yet.

00:11:33.782 --> 00:11:35.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Haven't been
made--exactly that.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.020 align:middle line:90%
Except it's a good tool.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Its use will depend
upon someone who

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:90%
has that particular view of me.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's a wonderful thing.

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Where do you hope to be in 10
years, or so, with all of this?

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.000 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever--

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably starting
on a third book.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you think--

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.640 align:middle line:84%
I know you're working on
a book about legalization.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Not actually.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm working with a group
who is, more or less, funded

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to make arguments
that would be raised--

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.730 align:middle line:84%
to address arguments to be
raised in the legalization

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.750 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:84%
What would the answer of how
drugs would be legalized?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
How would they be
made available?

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Should it be an
open supermarket?

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Or should it be under some
sort of governmental control?

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's a research-- more
than that-- a policy group.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Study.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's setting up for that.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
I think it's futile
in the present state.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:32.710 align:middle line:90%
>> In terms of practical impact.

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone is
going to seriously entertain

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.610 align:middle line:90%
legalization.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So it's a-- it may
be a field process,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.823 align:middle line:90%
but it's a fun process.

00:12:39.823 --> 00:12:41.707 align:middle line:84%
Because, in the process
you're beginning

00:12:41.707 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:84%
evaluating your own relationship
with drug laws, drug

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:90%
regulations, drug control.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
>> If you were in charge of it,
how do you see it happening?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are there drugs
you would keep legal?

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.052 align:middle line:90%
Or do you think it should be--

00:12:57.052 --> 00:12:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What I would do,
if I were running it,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I would keep certain laws
that would protect people

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:90%
of innocence.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:84%
I would have absolutely
no drug with children

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.309 align:middle line:90%
who are of too young an age.

00:13:07.309 --> 00:13:08.600 align:middle line:90%
God knows what that age may be.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.690 align:middle line:90%
>> So 16, 19, 21--

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, perhaps.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe alcohol might.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Absolutely unallowed
giving drugs to anyone without

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.292 align:middle line:90%
their consent.

00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Naturally.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Informed consent,
knowledge, education.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.570 align:middle line:84%
I would make
absolutely available,

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:84%
at all levels of propaganda,
restriction, information

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:90%
that is factual about drugs.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Then I'd open a drugstore.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And you people--
would they overuse?

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think that very
quickly dampen itself

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.890 align:middle line:84%
down to maybe about
what we have now.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.318 align:middle line:84%
But do a-- remove
the criminality,

00:13:42.318 --> 00:13:47.375 align:middle line:84%
remove the violence, remove the
entire social disruptiveness

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.710 align:middle line:84%
that these drug
laws have caused.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you encourage the
government to see these drugs

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.570 align:middle line:84%
as a vehicle for
gaining tax revenue?

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think the government
should stay off that?

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably-- probably some
tax revenue would be valid,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.799 align:middle line:84%
as with other drugs of
abuse, other things of abuse.

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:07.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Similarly to alcohol--

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Similarly--

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:08.950 align:middle line:90%
>> --and tobacco.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a good model.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:90%
It's a good model.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:90%
And, perhaps, it's a valid one.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's pretty much what
I suggested in my book that I

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:84%
agree with you that it's easy
to sit down and come up with

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:84%
a fine plan overcoming
the political hurdles

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:90%
of an American--

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.361 align:middle line:84%
>> Too many people have too much
to benefit on the laws being

00:14:26.361 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
what they are and even
becoming more intense.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And until you change that
motivation-- that reward--

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, the most cynical
and the most naive people

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in America are keeping
the drug problem going.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The most cynical, by
dealing and importing

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
drugs and the most naive
through the kind of Christian

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.167 align:middle line:90%
terror of--

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Look at the monstrous
industries that have been built

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.300 align:middle line:90%
up with it.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.820 align:middle line:90%
The drug urine screening.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.800 align:middle line:90%
Shameful.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> But they're
multibillion dollar things.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.410 align:middle line:84%
This kit, that GCMS,
this instrumentation,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.677 align:middle line:84%
these people who make
little wax urine bottles.

00:15:04.677 --> 00:15:06.760 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming-- there's
no justification for urine

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:84%
screening at any
time, of anyone,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:84%
under any circumstance
on a random basis.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:12.530 align:middle line:90%
None.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and the notion that
in a democratic society people

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.490 align:middle line:84%
would get into that kind
of thing, it's incredible,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.710 align:middle line:84%
>> It's completely contrary to
the principles of our society--

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.389 align:middle line:90%
the assumption of innocence.

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:84%
We blew it, because it's
not in the Constitution.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It should have been
in there, but it wasn't.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:84%
>> But taking a urine sample on
a random basis is an assumption

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:90%
of guilt. That's intolerable.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, but what is in the
Bill of Rights is life, liberty,

00:15:36.562 --> 00:15:37.770 align:middle line:90%
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.395 align:middle line:84%
>> No, the Declaration
of Independence.

00:15:39.395 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Declaration of Independence.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.180 align:middle line:90%
But that could be used--

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.334 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be.

00:15:42.334 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:90%
It could be part--

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> --as a sufficient basis for.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a form of self image.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.016 align:middle line:84%
And we should maintain
the deception.

00:15:48.016 --> 00:15:48.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:48.816 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing that
goes when society hits the wall

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.300 align:middle line:90%
is democracy.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:90%
