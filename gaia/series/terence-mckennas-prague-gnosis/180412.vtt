00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Angeles Arrien is an
anthropologist and workshop

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:84%
leader from California who
brings the unique perspective

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.030 align:middle line:84%
of her Basque ancestors to
the formulation of a new

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.490 align:middle line:84%
discipline, which I would
call neoshamanic anthropology.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So there you have it, as
the king said to Mozart.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Yes, as the caterpillar on
top of the mushroom said,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.690 align:middle line:90%
who are you?

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so I can looked
over your newsletter.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And it looks like
sort of neoshamanism

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.850 align:middle line:84%
is the category that you are now
defining in your public talks.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing a lot of that,
but mostly universals,

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
what we all have
in common, finding

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.190 align:middle line:84%
those basic roots,
which than take us

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:90%
back to indigenous cultures.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Archetypes?

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Archetypes.

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Especially the archetype
of the warrior and the healer

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and the teacher
and the visionary.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Those are the four that the
shamanic or indigenous cultures

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.690 align:middle line:90%
really focus upon.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so you're genuinely in
the mainstream of the archaic

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.372 align:middle line:90%
revival.

00:01:48.372 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I never thought about
it that way, Terence.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, actually, it's sort
of subliminally plugged in one

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.560 align:middle line:84%
of my blocks, which is
called "The Archaic Revival."

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
But the notion is that what
this whole cultural thrust

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:84%
of the 20th century, and
especially in the last 30 years

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.009 align:middle line:84%
will ultimately be
understood to be about

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.020 align:middle line:84%
is a return to
aboriginal models.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:10%
And that means especially
shamanism and, to my mind,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.550 align:middle line:10%
especially
psychedelic shamanism.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.795 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:22.595 align:middle line:90%
Both.

00:02:22.595 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But you know, the Renaissance
went through a rebirth

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.280 align:middle line:84%
of classicism, probably without
ever really articulating that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:90%
that's what was happening.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think this shamanic
or aboriginal, ecological,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.950 align:middle line:84%
feminine partnership impulse
is now pretty explicit.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's what i mean.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, I think that--

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I love the title like
"Archaic Revival,"

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:84%
because at the same
time, what's coming up

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is everyone talking
about a new world order.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And yet in order to understand
what constitutes a new world

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.750 align:middle line:84%
order, we need to take a look
at what the current world

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:90%
order is.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we really have,
essentially, four worlds.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.320 align:middle line:84%
We have the industrialized,
First World.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
socialist bloc, which

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:90%
would be the Second World.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And we have the Third
World countries,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.240 align:middle line:84%
which are really the developing
countries, like Brazil.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.830 align:middle line:84%
But the fourth world is really
the aboriginal, indigenous

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
cultures that are
within cultures,

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
but don't have the
same kind of rights.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And the first three
worlds say that the land

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:90%
belongs to the people.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.070 align:middle line:84%
But the fourth world, says that
the people belong to the land.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that people
belonging to the land,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:90%
it's your archaic revival.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:90%
But it's getting back to nature.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And owning those roots
brings up that revival,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:84%
which is the shift
that we're going

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
to need to make in order
to do the new world order,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:84%
is to get people
back to the land.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's too bad that
there's no place in the world

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
where that aboriginal position
is in a governing position.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Starting for the first time
in the last three years is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.490 align:middle line:84%
the establishment of the
World Indigenous Council.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:84%
And this summer, in
July, is the first time

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:84%
that there will
actually be a vote

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84%
to have a seat on
the United Nations,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.910 align:middle line:84%
where there will
be representatives

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
from each of the world
indigenous peoples.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm real
hopeful about that.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.245 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean, every Amazonian
tribe could potentially have

00:05:07.245 --> 00:05:08.045 align:middle line:90%
a delegate--

00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:09.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Or that they themselves could
have a council and vote who

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.395 align:middle line:84%
would be their best
representatives as a bioregion.

00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:22.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know,
it always, the--

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.522 align:middle line:90%
there's some phrase in Latin.

00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember
what it is, but it

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.060 align:middle line:84%
means that he who does
not expand his borders,

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:84%
will have his land
taken by somebody else.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And this was the theory
that drove colonization

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
All of these
countries, like Peru,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Colombia, Ecuador,
Venezuela actually

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
encroach on a fast aboriginal
core in and of that continent,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.320 align:middle line:90%
which should be self-governing.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And were it self-governing,
would be tremendous.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge force.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge force.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing that I really think
that, for the last 20 years,

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:84%
there's been this whole
East-West bridging.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.510 align:middle line:84%
But we're really starting
in the last five years

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to this North-South
kind of bridging.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And I really feel that the Latin
American countries, which there

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
are 12 plus the indigenous
forest countries that

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:84%
in the northern forest
would be Europe, Russia,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Canada, but the
whole southern force

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:84%
is like Africa, Asia, and
the Latin American countries.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So that whole
force and those two

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.930 align:middle line:90%
forces really coming together.

I do.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm really excited
because that the grandparents

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I was thinking about the
grandparents of the planet

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
being the old Asian cultures
and all the Pacific Rim.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
exciting thing that's

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:44.040 align:middle line:84%
happening in Europe for the
first time in history, that 11

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.690 align:middle line:84%
countries are coming together
to form a European coalition

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.730 align:middle line:84%
that it puts the child of the
planet, which is like America

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.170 align:middle line:84%
or the United States,
which is so based on a hero

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
myth or a heroine myth
and fierce independence,

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
that the call in
the next 50 years

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.770 align:middle line:84%
is for Americans to
learn about community.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Which indigenous societies and
the grandparents of the planet,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.480 align:middle line:84%
the old Asian cultures, and
now the parents of the planet,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.240 align:middle line:84%
really modeling teamwork and
collaboration and community,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
is that America is going
to need to really learn

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
about collaboration and
community and cooperation.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.679 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do
that, then there's

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
going to need to be
the going back to what

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
would be the archaic
revival, or that beginning

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:84%
to shift, so that there
can be a new world order,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.780 align:middle line:84%
where that fourth
world is addressed.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, don't you think sort of
what's happening is that people

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
have a very strong local
sense of place, loyalty?

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, they are
forming a planetary loyalty,

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.510 align:middle line:84%
but in a way, all the levels
in between are dissolving.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
So people don't think of
themselves as Americans.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.780 align:middle line:84%
They think of themselves
as northern Californians

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.110 align:middle line:84%
and earthlings,
sort of like that.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But in a way,
federal Europe, which

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
is no longer a sure
thing, you know,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.335 align:middle line:84%
begins with these
recent developments.

00:09:25.335 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:90%
It goes against that.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:84%
I sort of think maybe
McLuhan was right

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and that there is
going to be a kind

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
of electronic feudalization,
where many more

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:90%
small states will emerge.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And the recent death
throe for the nation state

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
appears to be
slowly disappearing.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And the states, I think the
crisis that came to Marxism

00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is coming now for the republic
craft oligarchy in America.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I think you're right.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.980 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a terrific
shift of power that's

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:15.210 align:middle line:84%
going on, that out of maybe the
hierarchical types of power,

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.890 align:middle line:90%
to people power.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And I see two major
forces contributing

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:84%
to that, which is one of the
computer or the electronic,

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:84%
because it's people,
peopled-based,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:84%
individual based, bringing the
power back to the individual.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And also free enterprise, rather
than capitalism or communism.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.230 align:middle line:84%
There's that middle
road coming in.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So I think that when we take
a look, cross-culturally,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
at the three kinds of power
or the power of presence

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
or the power of communication
or the power position,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.810 align:middle line:84%
the willingness to
take a stand, is

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.050 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to be
very important to see how

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.190 align:middle line:84%
those shifts of power
really are going back

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:90%
to empowerment of the people.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, don't you think that's
why meeting in Prague was

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:84%
a great choice, because
these people managed to make

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:90%
a bloodless revolution?

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.860 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> A velvet brick through.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:20.330 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:20.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Velvet brick.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.670 align:middle line:84%
>> They weren't composed of a
population of two 220 million

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.800 align:middle line:90%
meatheads either.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Did you want cream?

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.780 align:middle line:90%
A little cream for the--

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
thank you.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.410 align:middle line:90%
Resourceful little weasel.

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:51.295 align:middle line:90%


00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm delighted that your
works are coming out this year

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.130 align:middle line:90%
and next year.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, probably not
half as delighted as I am.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It certainly takes a long
time to get this stuff out.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But in my case, they
ignored me for 25 years.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So when they finally decided
I was maybe a good marketing

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.510 align:middle line:90%
risk, they bought everything.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so wonderful.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
I can remember when the first
set of packaging of six tapes--

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.080 align:middle line:84%
remember when those
first came out?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's wonderful to see
when the timing is right,

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.850 align:middle line:84%
how the shifts take place
and the needed knowledge

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
is really highlighted
to come to the forehead.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, timing and persistence
and positioning is everything,

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're the person
who's always shows up,

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.750 align:middle line:84%
sooner or later,
you get to the top.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:56.330 align:middle line:90%
It's also diligence.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've
really been diligent

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to your original vision,
which has been wonderful.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you've been
at it for a while too.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.105 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:05.105 --> 00:13:05.905 align:middle line:90%
We have both have.

00:13:05.905 --> 00:13:07.666 align:middle line:90%
>> And done very well.

00:13:07.666 --> 00:13:08.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:11.440 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are you
looking toward the future,

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:90%
personally and globally?

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been doing all that
a lot with taking a look

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:84%
at what's found that's
similar in all art, globally,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.650 align:middle line:84%
because I feel that what
humanity consistently creates

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:39.910 align:middle line:84%
in art is really reinforcing
deep spiritual processes.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And so what I've
found is that there

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
are five shapes that are
found consistently in all art

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:90%
globally.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:90%
And one is the circle.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.310 align:middle line:84%
The other is the cross,
like the plus sign,

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.410 align:middle line:90%
the equidistant cross.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.935 align:middle line:84%
And the triangle and the
square and the spiral.

00:13:59.935 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can see it see
them all here in Prague,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.435 align:middle line:84%
everywhere you look, I
mean, in all the decor

00:14:10.435 --> 00:14:14.540 align:middle line:84%
are those shapes repeated
over and over and over again.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.435 align:middle line:84%
So I begin to look
cross-culturally to see

00:14:17.435 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
if cultures attributed the
same meaning to those shapes

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
and found that 92%
of all the cultures

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
that tribute the same
meaning to the circle, which

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
is the process of individuation
or to the cross, relatedness,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and interconnection
and interface.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And the square, stability
and foundation setting.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And the--

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So does this imply a genetic
syntax of form or something

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:90%
like that?

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it's part
of the archaic revival,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.800 align:middle line:84%
in that there would be a deeply
cellular imprinting of some

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.600 align:middle line:90%
kind.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's what
I mean by genetic.

00:15:05.067 --> 00:15:06.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.200 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Or the triangle being
the visionary or searching,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.130 align:middle line:84%
seeking, questing
process or planning,

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.090 align:middle line:84%
dreaming process and
the spiral being,

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
the need for variety or the
need for change or growth

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.620 align:middle line:90%
and evolution.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:90%
So it's been really wonderful.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a new
book that's coming out

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
called "Signs of Life," and
showing how those images come

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.850 align:middle line:84%
up in all of the
continents and are also

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:44.245 align:middle line:84%
found in literature, poetry,
and put all that together in one

00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:45.670 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:49.725 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you spend much time
thinking about the future?

00:15:49.725 --> 00:15:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:90%
>> What's your take on it?

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it's
exciting for me to think that

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
we're being called in the next
50 years to our own creative

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
fire, that we all
have salvation myths.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And we all have doomsday
myths, but there's

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.420 align:middle line:84%
a whole body of myths
in mythology that

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
have been totally overlooked,
that I think we're being called

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:90%
to, which are creation myths.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And what are the creation
myths, but stories

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
about how to build new worlds,
internally and externally?

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
for 2,000 years,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:90%
we've done the polarity dance.

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're moving
into a both and world

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:90%
rather than an either or world.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited about the
future that if we can really

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
move into the wisdom
of the plant kingdom

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
and if we can move into
the deep wisdom of nature

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:06.710 align:middle line:84%
as a mirror of our own nature
and remember our creative fire,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.710 align:middle line:84%
I think it will be a
wonderful time in history.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad I was
born at the time I

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:84%
was born to be a part of this
evolutionary Renaissance.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.249 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you see it happening?

00:17:18.249 --> 00:17:22.369 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you see a
breakthrough with technology

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.710 align:middle line:90%
or an abandonment of technology?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Do you see pharmacological
engineering?

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Do you see new religions?

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:36.650 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's easy
to hope, but very hard

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:90%
to get the details in focus.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:44.720 align:middle line:10%
I think that what I
see is that there'll

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:10%
be both the bridging of the
natural and the technological.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:58.055 align:middle line:84%
>> So a more
cellular technology?

00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:58.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:58.855 --> 00:18:01.100 align:middle line:84%
>> A more organic
infrastructure.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
computers are here

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:09.420 align:middle line:84%
to teach us about those
organic structures.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:10%
I think that we're learning
different kinds of systems

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:10%
to really see what are the
inherent systems within nature

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.530 align:middle line:10%
and within our own nature.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So to the degree that
we can mirror nature,

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:31.070 align:middle line:84%
we can respiritualize,
rehumanize technology

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.475 align:middle line:90%
and interpersonal relations.

00:18:32.475 --> 00:18:33.275 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:33.275 --> 00:18:33.740 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.781 align:middle line:90%
Which would be wonderful.

00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I come right
down the line on that.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, psychedelics are
just simply the best catalyst.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:84%
But anything which works
should be pushed to the limit.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And I know I was just thinking
that, somehow, we've got

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:90%
to think about possibilities.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.480 align:middle line:10%
I was thinking about in
the Rosicrucian era, which

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.770 align:middle line:10%
is very close here to Prague
is that they would often

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:10%
say you can count the
seeds in an apple,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.790 align:middle line:10%
but you can't count
the apples in a seed.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're moving in
that era of where we've really

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.450 align:middle line:84%
think of the
possibilities in the seeds

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that we have been planting,
or the fact that computers are

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:35.090 align:middle line:84%
teaching us about instant
feedback or instant response

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and acknowledgment and that
the power of acknowledgment

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.960 align:middle line:84%
and feedback to allow
organisms to grow.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why children
are, in many ways,

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.240 align:middle line:84%
know that instinctively
that they're

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:84%
mesmerized by that they
can get a yes or no are

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:84%
go back or fatal error
or whatever it might be.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a kind of
explicit hard wiring of our own

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:90%
unconscious.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.220 align:middle line:84%
No more do we create
cultural artifacts

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.230 align:middle line:90%
that are simply our furniture.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.970 align:middle line:84%
But now, our
thoughts, our values,

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:90%
are embodies in this stuff.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.375 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exciting.

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very exciting.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:18.850 align:middle line:90%
>> It really is.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I envision a future world
where people are nomadic,

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:84%
aboriginal, physically perfect,
living basically naked.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.760 align:middle line:84%
But if you were inside one
of these people's minds,

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
you would see that when
they close their eyes,

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:84%
there are menus hanging in
space, that the culture has

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.340 align:middle line:84%
been shrunk down to something
rather like a contact

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:84%
lens, which is in the
forefront of their eyelid.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.410 align:middle line:84%
And they look into culture
by closing their eyes.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And when they open their
eyes, nature in her radiance

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:90%
is all around.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:90%
