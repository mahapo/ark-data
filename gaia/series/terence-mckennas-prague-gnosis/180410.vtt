00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Ken, you've certainly
spent a number of years

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.480 align:middle line:90%
on these questions.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking with
Dr. Kenneth Ring.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.540 align:middle line:84%
We're in the Prague
Botanical Gardens.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ring is the author
of "The Omega Project"

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.870 align:middle line:84%
and is the world's
leading expert

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:90%
on the near-death experience.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Ken, I know recently you've
been interested in UFOs.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.110 align:middle line:84%
How did you get from
near-death experiences to UFOs?

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:90%
That seems quite a leap.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, on one
perhaps mistaken day,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I picked up a copy of Whitley
Strieber's book "Communion",

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.350 align:middle line:90%
came out some years ago.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And though I had no interest
in, and in fact an aversion

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
to UFO studies,
I found that some

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of the effects
that he was talking

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
about of those experiences
seemed very reminiscent

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.519 align:middle line:90%
of those that followed NDEs.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I wanted to
explore the connection.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.280 align:middle line:90%
I see what you mean.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, why do you think it is
that these abduction phenomenon

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.750 align:middle line:84%
never happen to what I
would call smart people?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's
only some poor soul

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
who lives in a trailer
park who has this happen.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't think so.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I think that there are people
who have these experiences that

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:84%
come from a pretty wide
swath of the social register,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:90%
up and down.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.240 align:middle line:84%
What I found in my
studies is actually,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
the people who are prone
to these experiences

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.950 align:middle line:84%
are folks with a
troubled background.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.730 align:middle line:84%
They often report
traumatic childhoods.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.360 align:middle line:10%
They report sexual abuse,
stressful childhoods.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.030 align:middle line:10%
They're people who,
even as children, seemed

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.430 align:middle line:10%
to be susceptible
not to fantasy,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.690 align:middle line:10%
but to alternate realities.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is
equally likely to have

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.350 align:middle line:90%
this kind of experience.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't think these
folks are pathological

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.000 align:middle line:84%
or come from some
particular social stratum.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.860 align:middle line:84%
But they have
particular kinds of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.750 align:middle line:84%
psychological
characteristics that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
predispose them to have
these kinds of experiences.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:10%
>> How do you relate this
phenomenon to your own field

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.980 align:middle line:10%
of expertise, which is
the near-death experience?

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:10%
>> What I found is if you look
at the phenomena themselves,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:10%
they seem extremely different
in terms of their feature

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:10%
surfaces.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.097 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:10%
You look at the
near-death experience,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.260 align:middle line:10%
it's a very blissful
experience, it's very beautiful.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:10%
People have very many positive
things to say about it.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:10%
You look at the
abduction experience,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:10%
people are traumatized
by it, deeply frightened,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:10%
disturbed by it.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.340 align:middle line:90%
They seem at antipodes.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.910 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the
structure of these experiences,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.400 align:middle line:90%
the structure is the same.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
They have the structure shamanic
journeys, of initiations.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.710 align:middle line:84%
You're taken from
the ordinary world.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:90%
You're taken to another world.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.494 align:middle line:90%
You learn things.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:84%
You are transformed
in that world,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:84%
and you bring back those
transformations with you.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.150 align:middle line:84%
What I found was that the
same kind of background that's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
typical for people that
report UFO encounters,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
not limited to but
including abductions,

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the same
kind of profile

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that you find for
people that have had

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.910 align:middle line:90%
NDEs, near-death experiences.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.770 align:middle line:10%
Same kind of person
is prone to them.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:10%
So I talk about an
encounter-prone personality

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.890 align:middle line:10%
who's susceptible or vulnerable
to these kinds of experiences

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.540 align:middle line:10%
more than the average person.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.570 align:middle line:10%
But the key thing that
relates these two phenomena,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:10%
and perhaps others like
them, are the transformations

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:10%
that tend to take place in
the lives of people afterward.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:10%
People with both
kinds of experiences

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:10%
say afterward they are
more appreciative of life,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.490 align:middle line:10%
more appreciative of nature.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.460 align:middle line:10%
They have a deeper
feeling of self-worth.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:10%
They are more
compassionate individuals,

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:10%
less materialistic.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:90%
They are more spiritual.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:84%
They're not necessarily
more religious.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:10%
In fact, they may
be less religious,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.565 align:middle line:10%
but they're more spiritual.

00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:22.440 align:middle line:10%
They're more psychic.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.970 align:middle line:10%
They're more intuitive.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.210 align:middle line:10%
What seems to be the outcome
of these experiences is however

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.520 align:middle line:10%
different the
experiences themselves

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:10%
may be in their content,
the effect is the same.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
You go through an ordeal
of either nearly dying

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:84%
or the shock of a UFO
encounter, and you're

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:90%
changed by that experience.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:10%
Like Nietzsche said, that
which doesn't kill me

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:10%
makes me stronger.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:10%
These people are
stronger spiritually.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:10%
They seem to function
at higher levels

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.340 align:middle line:10%
of intuitive understanding,
of psychic awareness.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an expanding
experience for both.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's interesting that
the personality profile is

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:84%
the same, but in one case,
the reaction is positive,

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.710 align:middle line:90%
the other negative.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Do people have
near-death experiences

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:90%
without coming near to death?

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:90%
There are lots of ways.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
I think the near-death
experience is misleading

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:84%
because it implies there's
something unique that happens

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%
at the point of
physical death or when

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.930 align:middle line:90%
people enter clinical death.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:10%
There are many
different pathways

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:10%
that lead to essentially
the same experiences

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.370 align:middle line:10%
without having to throw yourself
under the tires of the nearest

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:10%
oncoming truck,
many different ways

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:10%
to get into this
kind of experience.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So relate it a little bit
to the psychedelic experience.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd be happy to.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I've talked with
a lot of people--

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've
talked to many more--

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
who have had high dose LSD
sessions or other kinds

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelic sessions
who have told me,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.980 align:middle line:84%
in effect, well, I never
came close to death

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
but I know exactly
what you mean when

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
you talk about a
near-death experience

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.490 align:middle line:84%
because I've had the same thing,
the out-of-body experience,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of moving into a
beautiful, radiant, illuminated

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
space, the sense
of being flooded

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:84%
with total universal
knowledge, of being transformed

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.740 align:middle line:84%
in the instant and bringing
that transformation back.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.450 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's like the light
or spiritual reality,

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.430 align:middle line:84%
or whatever this
thing may be called,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.336 align:middle line:90%
is available all the time.

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:84%
There are just different
access routes to it.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:84%
The psychedelic is
clearly one route

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
that leads to that destination.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.170 align:middle line:84%
The near-death
experiences is another.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.826 align:middle line:84%
People following a spiritual
path and deeply committed to it

00:06:34.826 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
could have the same
kind of revelation,

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.040 align:middle line:90%
the same kinds of insights.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that it's a question
of equifinality, many different

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
pathways leading to
the same destination,

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and the same
transformative effects.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
That's what I think is important
about those experiences.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now, we've had
psychedelic experiences

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and near-death experiences
presumably for millennia.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:90%
Is this abduction thing new?

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Or are we just getting
the old stuff repackaged,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.540 align:middle line:90%
in a funny way?

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that it's
related to things that have

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:90%
always happened to humankind.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
You know, interaction with the
invisible world of spirits.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Your phrase, I think,
was sylphs of the air,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.760 align:middle line:90%
the elementals, the fairies.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Folklore, I think,
is certainly related

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:90%
to this particular phenomenon.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
However, even among
folklorists like Eddie Bullard,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
for example, who's the one
who's looked into this most

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
closely from the standpoint of
the UFO abduction phenomenon,

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
there seem to be aspects of this
experience that make it unique

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
unto itself, make it similar
to the folkloric experiences

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:90%
of former times.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And yet it's in a kind
of technological gloss,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I think maybe
because the alien is

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
kind of the mythic
archetype of our time.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not fashionable to see
angels and spirits and demons

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.710 align:middle line:84%
anymore, but the myth
of the extraterrestrial

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:90%
is everywhere you look.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I think in a way, this
particular kind of archetype

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
has been clothed in the imagery
and the kind of space age

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.540 align:middle line:84%
technology and talk
and so on that's

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.252 align:middle line:90%
characteristic of our own time.

00:08:14.252 --> 00:08:15.960 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
something unique to it

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.440 align:middle line:84%
and something that relates
to the folkloric experiences

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
of former times,
too, because contact

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
between the invisible world
and the physical world,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:84%
that's probably as
old as man is old.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But essentially, it sounds
as though you're fundamentally

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:39.832 align:middle line:84%
a psychologist in that you
don't take this at face value.

00:08:39.832 --> 00:08:40.632 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:08:40.632 --> 00:08:44.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't take these as literal
experiences of an incursion

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.830 align:middle line:84%
into physical
space time reality,

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.080 align:middle line:84%
of little beings
from other places

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.820 align:middle line:84%
that have come to do
nasty things to people.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
That, oddly enough--
it seems odd to me--

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.380 align:middle line:84%
seems to be the dominant
view of America ufologists.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a ufologist.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.230 align:middle line:90%
As you say, I'm a psychologist.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.540 align:middle line:84%
In Europe I think of
the interpretation

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:90%
is quite different.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't take these
experiences literal,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.440 align:middle line:84%
but I take them as real
within an alternate reality,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:84%
within what Henri Corbet
calls an imaginal realm.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.700 align:middle line:90%
They're real enough.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, people who
have near-death experiences

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
will say things like this
experience was more real to me

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.400 align:middle line:84%
than you and I sitting here
talking about it is real.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It's more real than life itself.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a reality
to these experiences,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.990 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's
a profound mistake

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
to think it's the same
thing as space time

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:90%
ordinary sensory world reality.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying is that
these are symbolic constructs.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a symbolic
aspect to them.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
important thing--

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think there are
two attitudes toward the UFO

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.190 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a mystery, but there
are two types of mysteries.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:84%
There are mysteries like
in detective stories that

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.910 align:middle line:84%
beg for some kind of
solution, and you only

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:84%
feel satisfaction when the
solution at the end is revealed

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and all the reasons given.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.594 align:middle line:84%
Then there are mysteries that
are meant to be explored--

00:10:00.594 --> 00:10:01.393 align:middle line:90%
>> True mysteries.

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>> To be savored.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.650 align:middle line:90%
True mysteries.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle line:84%
And these mysteries
beg for exploration,

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.790 align:middle line:84%
not for explanation, if
I can put it that way.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And the UFO seems to me--
the UFO phenomenon is

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:90%
the second category of mystery.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why I
personally, and perhaps

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
temperamentally, I'm
opposed to the idea

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.400 align:middle line:84%
of trying to package it as
though it were something

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.910 align:middle line:84%
as simple as other beings,
however amazing that would be

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.360 align:middle line:84%
in itself, other beings coming
from other places in the galaxy

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.826 align:middle line:84%
to invade or to have some
contact in human affairs.

00:10:30.826 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I think the mystery is
likely to be much more

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:90%
profound than that.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And another thing, if I may
say, that I think hooks together

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.070 align:middle line:84%
the near-death experience
with the UFO experience,

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.340 align:middle line:84%
whatever its basis may be,
is when people come out

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.980 align:middle line:84%
of these experiences and
have worked it through,

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.290 align:middle line:84%
they come to have
a world view that

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
is very similar to
one another and is

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.940 align:middle line:84%
very similar to what's
being talked about all

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.140 align:middle line:90%
the time at this conference.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's an
ecological worldview.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
The heightening of
ecological sensitivity,

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
the increase of concern with
the welfare of the planet,

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.330 align:middle line:84%
is one thing that
unites this two

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle line:84%
people, even though they
have these very disparate

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.730 align:middle line:84%
What they say about
what they've learned

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:84%
from these experiences, what
the meaning of these experiences

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.900 align:middle line:84%
for them is that the fate of
the Earth is in our hands,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and we better wake up to do
something about it very quick.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So I see these
experiences, perhaps,

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.310 align:middle line:90%
being orchestrated by--

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I think this is
similar to your view,

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.430 align:middle line:84%
perhaps-- a planetary mind,
an overmind, a mind at large,

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:84%
which is, in some sense, the
expression of our deepest

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
yearnings and perhaps
our deepest fears that

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
are feeding back these kinds of
experiences in the form of kind

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:84%
of archetypal experiences,
archetypal images, so as

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to impress people who might not
otherwise be impressed to take

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.429 align:middle line:84%
the kind of action
necessary to correct

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:84%
the direction in which
the Earth is headed.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a kind
of confoundment.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Its purpose is to
be inexplicable.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:02.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.980 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly how
I conclude my book.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.545 align:middle line:84%
I say the point of
these experiences

00:12:06.545 --> 00:12:09.530 align:middle line:84%
is to be baffled by them,
almost as though they're

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.010 align:middle line:84%
a kind of a koan that
we're not meant to solve,

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:17.120 align:middle line:84%
but we're meant to kind of chew
over until our rational mind

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.560 align:middle line:84%
cracks and we begin to
think in entirely new ways,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully act in
entirely new ways.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's a way of
keeping us from closure.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a deconstruction
phenomenon, you could even say.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:84%
>> It's saying to us the world
is not so simple as you might

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:90%
choose to suppose.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly so.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:90%
