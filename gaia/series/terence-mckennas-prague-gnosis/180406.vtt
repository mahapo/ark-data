00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So what we are
trying to find out

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.540 align:middle line:84%
is lost knowledge,
not new knowledge.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you direct people
back toward 10,000,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
20,000 years ago, they see
a kind of completion that

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.899 align:middle line:90%
an open-ended future is--

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:42.909 align:middle line:84%
>> Seems to me it's a confusing
thing to use time in that way,

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.080 align:middle line:84%
because it makes the artifacts
of that period seem to be

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
valued, as opposed to the
artifacts of this period.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to me that
I-- what do you call it?

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Not science fiction,
but science fiction

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:90%
can also be very compassionate.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
It can be very
historically relevant.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have to be--

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:84%
it's just using a different set
of artifacts to work with, so.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for instance, I
see most of what's happened

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.240 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century as being
unconsciously driven by this

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.927 align:middle line:90%
fascination with the archaic.

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascination with the archaic?

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Whoa, of all the things
I predicted you'd say,

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't that.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.618 align:middle line:90%
Tell me, what does that mean?

00:09:25.618 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for instance,
impressionism deconstructs

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:36.640 align:middle line:84%
the hard image of realism and
give you a feeling tone thing,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.170 align:middle line:84%
which was very antithetical to
Victorian, Edwardian thought.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Then Freud and Jung
describe different aspects

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of the unconscious,
but to do it,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Freud has to talk about
repressed, primitive, sexual

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:90%
imaginings.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Jung talks about folklore,
fairy tales, and mythology.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, the Dadaists and
the surrealists are saying,

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:84%
we have to break up
the linear expectations

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:90%
of the bourgeois mind.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
at Jackson Pollock

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and those people who
say the image itself

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:90%
has to be thrown out.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And then, to my mind, the
psychedelic thing in the '60s,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:84%
based on rock and roll
and a boundary-dissolving

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:90%
psychedelic.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:30.080 align:middle line:84%
We, almost by a random
walk, are finding our way

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:36.840 align:middle line:84%
toward shamanism,
tribalism, nomadism.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Go beyond the "isms" to tell
me what we're really finding.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We're finding a world made
out of mind rather than stuff.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.910 align:middle line:84%
We're finding a world
made out of mind.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Every time you describe
which mind you find,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that's just a
limiting condition.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we just find the
thing of mind-created stuff,

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.230 align:middle line:90%
live in that, then what happens?

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:05.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there is a
transcendental dimension beyond

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.500 align:middle line:90%
language.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just hard as
hell to talk about it.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you live in
it, and talk from there,

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
then the forms that it will
manifest in become just

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.690 align:middle line:90%
the forms it manifests in.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:84%
It's nothing more or
less than that, so.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mean you download
the unspeakable into language

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.754 align:middle line:84%
and let the chips
fall where they may.

00:11:30.754 --> 00:11:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they don't
fall where they may.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.005 align:middle line:84%
They fall in a perfectly
harmonious pattern.

00:11:37.005 --> 00:11:39.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's them
falling where they may.

00:11:39.722 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Where they may,
where they will.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:42.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:45.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so what I'm
hearing from you is,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.280 align:middle line:84%
you have a very strong
sense of the pattern.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Strong enough that your
necessarily limited

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
personal viewpoint doesn't
tend to get in the way.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:84%
You can always push the
"reset to hope" button,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and then you hope
almost on principle.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Someone said to me,
stand halfway between hope

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.420 align:middle line:90%
and hopelessness.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:90%
I thought that was very useful.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.312 align:middle line:90%
>> And is that, eh?

00:12:19.312 --> 00:12:20.112 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:20.112 --> 00:12:20.912 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:12:20.912 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It's ah!

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.182 align:middle line:90%
>> It's ah.

00:12:23.182 --> 00:12:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the ecstasy of total
horror and total beauty

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:27.852 align:middle line:90%
at the same moment.

00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what I feel
again and again,

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.120 align:middle line:84%
Terence, when I'm with
somebody dying of AIDS.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.250 align:middle line:90%
My god, my heart's breaking.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
It's a ghastly-- the social
ostracization, this, that,

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.780 align:middle line:84%
opportunistic illness
and everything.

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's another part
of me that's giggling.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
And I can hardly handle
the multiphrenia of it

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
all in the sense
of the perfection

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of it all, and the
beauty of the moment,

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and the horrible shit of it.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it all
is spun together.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Is that because
you feel confident

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.410 align:middle line:84%
that the self is
somehow indestructible,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:84%
or because you don't
even ask that question?

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.312 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.312 --> 00:13:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> You got to watch the
words "indestructible,"

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:84%
because that has
a time dimension.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.930 align:middle line:90%
I think that awareness is.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.700 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But for example, do you think
this is the stage upon which

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.304 align:middle line:84%
all acts are performed, or
that we move up and down many

00:13:33.304 --> 00:13:34.104 align:middle line:90%
levels?

00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> No, this is
one of the stages.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:90%
Just, oh, infinite number of--

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:90%
probably infinite number of--

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I just look
into two minds, and I

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.330 align:middle line:90%
see two different ones.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And those are all
on just this one.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.460 align:middle line:84%
No, I feel like-- like I
have this friend Emmanuel.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.130 align:middle line:84%
You know, this spook
that has no body.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And Emmanuel's two
lines to me where,

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.610 align:middle line:90%
death is absolutely safe.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.830 align:middle line:10%
First thing.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.684 align:middle line:10%
That's a very
profound statement.

00:14:03.684 --> 00:14:05.100 align:middle line:10%
And the next thing
he said, it was

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:10%
like taking off a tight shoe.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.620 align:middle line:10%
And then I said to him,
Emmanuel, what am I doing here?

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:11.550 align:middle line:10%
Who made this error?

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:10%
What am I doing on this plane?

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:10%
He said, you're in school.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:10%
Why don't you try
taking the curriculum?

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:90%
>> And the curriculum is?

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Life.

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Any life?

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It means the exploration
of the clinging of mind within

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:90%
the world of projected form.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:10%
>> So the exploring life.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the exploring
life with the--

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.950 align:middle line:84%
it's purposive in the
sense of returning back

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.160 align:middle line:90%
into the Garden of Eden.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a return.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:84%
There is a return metaphor
underlying all of it.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'm sure you're asked
this all the time-- so am I--

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we give
different answers.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.210 align:middle line:84%
Do you think that this can be
done without psychedelics fast

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
enough to have an impact
on the global situation?

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I can conceive that
it could be, yeah.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:90%
You ask, do I think?

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't really have an opinion
whether it will or won't.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:90%
But I can see it go either way.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Like John Seed said to me--

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.250 align:middle line:90%
this ecologist.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:90%
He said--

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.390 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I know him.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:84%
>> John said to me, it's too
late as far as the rainforests

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.640 align:middle line:90%
are concerned.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
He says, the inertia is too
great in the whole system.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.570 align:middle line:90%
It's too late.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK, John.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.293 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was the
first time somebody

00:15:51.293 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:90%
said it to me just like that.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, it would
take a miracle.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
That threw me back
on whatever that was.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And then he said, but
after all, he said,

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
we came up out of the
ocean, and came onto land.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, we have quite
a lineage of miracles.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.460 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't underestimate us.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.010 align:middle line:90%
That was a nice form.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:16.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so my question to you
is, are psychedelics a miracle?

00:16:16.145 --> 00:16:18.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Psychedelics
are a miracle, yes.

00:16:18.272 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:84%
They may not be the
only miracle, though.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they the miracle we need?

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know that.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.474 align:middle line:84%
I think they may have already
done what they were to do.

00:16:26.474 --> 00:16:27.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:28.280 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.530 align:middle line:90%
I've never heard anybody say--

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I think what is done is so
much more powerful than anybody

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.520 align:middle line:90%
yet recognizes.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.951 align:middle line:84%
See, I see that all
this destruction is just

00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:38.200 align:middle line:90%
the process of transformation.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.270 align:middle line:84%
The question is whether
we keep it together

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.460 align:middle line:84%
in the process of
transformation.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why all
I'm interested doing

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
is becoming a person,
and helping others become

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
a person who, in the process
of the dramatic stuff,

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.510 align:middle line:84%
will keep some equanimity,
and keep some love,

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and some presence
in that process.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
But psychedelics may
play a role in that.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.490 align:middle line:90%
So you're right.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.260 align:middle line:84%
That comes back
to your question.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:09.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, see, my assumption in
trying to think about thousands

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic trips--

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
rather than just mine--

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.560 align:middle line:84%
what they seem to
do, generically,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:18.240 align:middle line:84%
is they seem to
dissolve boundaries.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.589 align:middle line:84%
>> And the ego is in the
business of creating,

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:84%
maintaining, and
defending boundaries.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So I really see the psychedelics
as directly intervening

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
in the core process which is
running us over the edge, which

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.170 align:middle line:84%
is our inability to
emotionally connect

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.670 align:middle line:84%
with the consequences
of what we're doing.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
If for a single moment, we
could feel what we're doing,

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.185 align:middle line:90%
we would stop.

00:17:47.185 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>> But we do not.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting, because you
take images that all of us know

00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:01.940 align:middle line:84%
of the girl running down the
street naked in Cambodia,

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.560 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And we say, that
wasn't strong enough.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.140 align:middle line:84%
It won the Life
of the Year Award,

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't strong enough.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It didn't stop everybody
and say, holy shit,

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.120 align:middle line:90%
what are we doing here?

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So what would be strong
enough to do that?

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:90%
And you say, well, psychedelics.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:90%
But it's in a one-on-one thing.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:28.190 align:middle line:84%
We're talking major game
players at this moment.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Put China into your computer.

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you deal with that?

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Either you're spraying
it, or it's water,

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:40.190 align:middle line:84%
or it's some other level of
consciousness that does it.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
There is a certain
level of trauma

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.570 align:middle line:84%
that's possible that
can soften the ground.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Not Three Mile Island
and not Chernobyl, but--

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't want to
create this with my mind,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.110 align:middle line:84%
but I can imagine a certain
trauma, like in Marin

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.460 align:middle line:90%
when they ran out of water.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.786 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, all the ego barriers
and everything-- and neighbors

00:19:03.786 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
were talking who'd never
even met each other.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.875 align:middle line:84%
>> People were taking
showers together.

00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.333 align:middle line:84%
>> And a whole
pro-- yeah, exactly.

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:09.710 align:middle line:90%
A whole process was happening.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure marriages,
babies were conceived.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Everything as a result of
that trauma, of that denial.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So a massive,
significant trauma--

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I just got to tell
you one scary image.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a saint in India
who lived up to about 1930,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I think, or something.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of his
devotees said to me,

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.980 align:middle line:84%
one night, he was sort of
looking off into the distance,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.530 align:middle line:84%
and he said,
there'll come a time,

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:37.340 align:middle line:84%
he said, when you'll walk
5 miles, and he said,

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.610 align:middle line:84%
you'll sight the light from
a fire of another person,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:45.196 align:middle line:84%
and you'll be so happy to
know another person exists.

00:19:45.196 --> 00:19:46.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite a prediction.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't that
quite a prediction?

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:90%
It's in there.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
It's just in there
somewhere, you know?

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:19:53.972 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:90%
Yes, well, I agree.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.030 align:middle line:84%
I think that what's
going to happen is that--

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Gentlemen, everything is fine
with the evolution of coffee

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.520 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness?

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.218 align:middle line:84%
Did we get a very
good review too?

00:20:10.218 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You have come just
at the right time.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:90%
This is just what I wanted.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:90%
How did you know?

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.905 align:middle line:90%
You tuned into a higher level.

00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:90%
>> A higher level?

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>> A higher level.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Level high, very high, yes.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.200 align:middle line:90%
Bohemian mushroom soup today.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Or you're eating the--

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.278 align:middle line:84%

talking about that.

00:20:24.278 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:26.930 align:middle line:90%
You like Bohemian mushroom soup?

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I like mushroom.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.980 align:middle line:10%

>> Oh, please.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Liberally sprinkle

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%

>> I am a chalice, so
it's fine if you wish to.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I know you
by your true name.

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:90%
You're Mr. Chalice, sir.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:90%

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.790 align:middle line:90%

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Please.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I was confused.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.425 align:middle line:10%
Let me put this here, and have
fun with the shaman strudel.

00:20:51.425 --> 00:20:52.292 align:middle line:90%

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.231 align:middle line:90%

>> I'll be right there.

00:20:57.188 --> 00:20:58.040 align:middle line:10%

It's a personal

How do you like having the
projection of special identity

constantly laid on you?

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.970 align:middle line:90%

It's my practice.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.400 align:middle line:10%

were grabbing at the
buttons of my jacket.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%

00:22:59.616 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:90%
I say, I'm not a good guy.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Don't follow me.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bad guy.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.300 align:middle line:84%
Then I leave the stage and say,
now I can really be a bad guy.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Come up and see
my holy pictures.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.350 align:middle line:84%
That's one of my
lines in my lecture.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, I
only see the stuff

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
that would disturb
me is inside myself.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.647 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to
do with out there.

00:23:27.647 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:10%
Out there, it's just
being what it is,

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:10%
and I'm responding
with my own stuff.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.640 align:middle line:10%
And if my stuff
is my enemy, it's

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.890 align:middle line:10%
going to get too much for me.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And if it isn't,
depends on how much

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.590 align:middle line:84%
I can consume it joyfully,
participate in it passionately,

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:90%
all of it.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you've sort of
achieved a unique synthesis.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.970 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you're almost
a secular holy man,

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.650 align:middle line:10%
because I don't think people--

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:10%
I don't care much
about what you believe,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:10%
or who you light candles to.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.970 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I think I heard
you describe yourself once

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:90%
as a kind man.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.580 align:middle line:84%
And you've gotten incredible
mileage out of that,

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.260 align:middle line:90%
because there are so few.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's far out.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:10.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.300 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is--

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when you
talked about coming back

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
into the
boundarylessness, to me,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:84%
that's the whole
quality of compassion.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.090 align:middle line:90%
Has that boundarylessness to it.

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:84%
It's that your suffering is my
suffering, and your joy is my--

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and you are me, and here
we are, and if you hurt--

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> And you feel.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:84%
>> --I'm responding
to your hurt,

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.620 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm a good
guy and you're needful.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Just because, this is
suffering, and this

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.210 align:middle line:90%
is the response to suffering.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're both part
of the same thing.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way I
like to play it from.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.350 align:middle line:84%
That's, to me, it's
like riding a wave.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the joy of just being
part of the force of compassion

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.340 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you mentioned in
your talk the other night.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Since some people think the '90s
are going to be a second turn

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:00.370 align:middle line:90%
of the spiral--

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I observed the '60s as a
spear-carrying 14-year-old.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:90%
I was down in the masses.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.470 align:middle line:84%
What were the mistakes that
are avoidable if there's

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:90%
a second chance?

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:21.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:84%
>> They're inevitably
going to be avoided.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.215 align:middle line:90%
The first mistake was idealism.

00:25:26.215 --> 00:25:27.710 align:middle line:90%
The first mistake.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And the mistake was thinking
that, because you had seen it,

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.440 align:middle line:84%
you could just go like that,
and everybody else would see it.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And you could just
say, it's all love,

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.870 align:middle line:90%
and then everybody would love.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.370 align:middle line:90%
It was a naivete.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:90%
It was naivete.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.250 align:middle line:84%
It was not working on
ourselves deeply enough

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.330 align:middle line:84%
to be without the
clinging of mind that

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:90%
made us try to use it.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It was our lurking righteousness
that got in our way.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you make a
revolution, though,

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:90%
without an inner righteousness?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the far-out question
of, where would the action come

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:90%
from?

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's this line in
Buddhism says, out of emptiness

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:90%
arises compassion.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
experiencing this there

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.690 align:middle line:84%
is a way in which I can sit
down in front of a truck,

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
or feed a person, or go
make love, or go surf,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and there is an appropriateness
in every one of those acts.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And for me to hear that,
I really got to shut up.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And my work is to keep shutting
up to hear which one it is.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it is a
revolution, so be it.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.910 align:middle line:90%
So be it.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:46.150 align:middle line:84%
You know the story of the
monk and the army general?

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And the army general's
disemboweling all the monks?

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And his reputation has
spread far and wide as a cruel,

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.690 align:middle line:90%
cruel man.

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And he comes into this village,
and he says to his adjutant,

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:90%
tell me what's happening.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.631 align:middle line:84%
And the adjutant
said, all the people

00:26:59.631 --> 00:27:01.282 align:middle line:84%
are frightened at
bowing down to you.

00:27:01.282 --> 00:27:02.740 align:middle line:84%
All the monks in
the monastery have

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:90%
fled to the hills but one monk.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And the general is outraged
about this one monk.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And he gets up, and he
goes to the monastery,

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.537 align:middle line:84%
and he pushes open the
doors of the monastery.

00:27:13.537 --> 00:27:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And he walks into the courtyard,
and there's the monk standing

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.590 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the courtyard.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And he walks up to him and he
says, don't you know who I am?

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:27.040 align:middle line:84%
I could take my sword and
run it through your belly

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.350 align:middle line:90%
without blinking an eye.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.930 align:middle line:90%
And don't you know who I am?

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I could have your sword
run through my belly

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.530 align:middle line:90%
without blinking an eye.

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:45.260 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the place from
which revolutions can heal,

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.770 align:middle line:84%
rather than just starting
the cycle all over again.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.825 align:middle line:84%
>> Then this is the place
we never found in the '60s.

00:27:50.825 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-mm.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I've always said
it was all well and good--

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.920 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.900 align:middle line:84%
We reduced it to
revolution rather--

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and although we had
the taste of evolution,

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.710 align:middle line:90%
we reduced it to revolution.

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and the day they
came with the machine guns,

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.810 align:middle line:90%
we didn't stand like that monk.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:90%
Everybody said, oh, my god.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:84%
You could get killed
playing this game.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And I flew to Laos and
India for three years.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But already, we
had produced a "they"

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.820 align:middle line:90%
by being so busy being "we."

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Truth.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>> So that they even noticed we.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.380 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they
noticed us was

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.550 align:middle line:84%
because we were busy
making statements

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.720 align:middle line:90%
instead of just being it.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.690 align:middle line:90%
>> So maybe--

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is just
occurring to me,

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.530 align:middle line:84%
that being in a
place like Prague,

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.440 align:middle line:84%
the real thing we
have to learn here

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is how to make
Velvet Revolutions.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Non-confrontational.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly right.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:46.170 align:middle line:90%
Exactly right.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.720 align:middle line:84%
That's why I admire
Havel so much.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
That's why he's way
up there in my--

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.960 align:middle line:84%
because he is a
compassionate leader.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.860 align:middle line:84%
He's got wisdom,
not just knowledge.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.580 align:middle line:90%
He is tuned.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a quality of his
heart that feels present.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.902 align:middle line:84%
And he said in this op-ed
article I just read,

00:29:02.902 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:90%
his letter last month--

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I read it too.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:10.770 align:middle line:10%
>> And at one point he said, we
have to allow the naturalness

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:10%
to come back.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:90%
The personal stuff.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.800 align:middle line:90%
The heart stuff.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.162 align:middle line:10%
I mean, he was right
there with all of the--

00:29:17.162 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you see--

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.590 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I don't want
to put you on the spot,

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.510 align:middle line:10%
but I don't, let me
preface it by saying.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.460 align:middle line:10%
Do you see anybody who
could play that role

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.470 align:middle line:10%
for the millions
of kids in England

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:35.270 align:middle line:10%
and the United States
who are now asking,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.610 align:middle line:10%
where do we go from here?

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:44.821 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.821 --> 00:29:47.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Mm-mm.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.080 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that good or bad?

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess the situation hasn't
demanded the emergence of that

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.350 align:middle line:90%
being yet.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Of those kinds of beings.

00:29:55.862 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it can't be anybody
that comes forward and says,

the person has to come forth,

and they're just forced out.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.314 align:middle line:84%

that are running
for this or that,

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:33.500 align:middle line:84%
and I go to breakfast with
them, and I listen, and I tune.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And Jerry Brown, I
hung out with, and I--

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.090 align:middle line:90%
he's got interesting ideas.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.130 align:middle line:84%

are killing them, and their
children, and their husbands.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
And some way, I've
got to play my part

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.670 align:middle line:84%
as a member of a society that
is imposing so much suffering

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.800 align:middle line:90%

away and say, oh, I'm

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I've also got to realize I'm
an American citizen that's

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.106 align:middle line:84%
hurting the Mayans,
and I've got to play

00:31:30.106 --> 00:31:34.080 align:middle line:84%
both games to change one
way and to do the other way.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.580 align:middle line:90%

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.480 align:middle line:84%
not to go egghead here,
but a kind of coincidentia

level, what you're saying is,

Don't worry.

And on another
level, you clearly

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:57.180 align:middle line:84%
are involved in a search
for defining your role

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.520 align:middle line:90%

>> But I am part of the system
that is taking care of itself.

standing inside of the--

without acting through self.

fruits of the action.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.700 align:middle line:84%
To me, one of my basic
texts is the Bhagavad Gita,

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and those are the
two injunctions.
