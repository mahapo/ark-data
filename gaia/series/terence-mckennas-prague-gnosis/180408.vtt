with Rupert Sheldrake,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
one of Britain's most
controversial natural

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.180 align:middle line:90%
scientists.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Sheldrake is the
proponent of a theory

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:90%
called morphic resonance.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.820 align:middle line:84%
He believes that the
presence of the past

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.920 align:middle line:84%
actually impinges on processes
in the present and the future.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.670 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
our world is as it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480 align:middle line:90%
is because of how it once was.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.240 align:middle line:84%
This is not a
genetic theory, not

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.480 align:middle line:84%
a theory of natural
selection, but a field theory,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.320 align:middle line:84%
which holds that actions
and situations in the past

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:84%
are able, through the mirror
act of having happened,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.719 align:middle line:84%
to shape future
and present events.

Baroque building is the Museum

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:90%
of Natural History in Prague.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to bring
you here because I

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.360 align:middle line:84%
thought it would be
an appropriate place

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.220 align:middle line:90%
to discuss your ideas.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, a museum is
a kind of archive of morphology.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, with these
stuffed animals and skeletons,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
they're like photographs,
snapshots of forms frozen.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.540 align:middle line:84%
But of course, each
animal behaves and moves.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Each animal develops
as an embryo

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:84%
to its adult form
and each one evolves.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.650 align:middle line:90%
So it's triply-dynamic.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:10%
We have to reconstruct
those in our minds.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.740 align:middle line:10%
But the whole thing really
is a reflection, I think,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.740 align:middle line:10%
of the memory
behind each species.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Each species is the repository
of an entire process of memory.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now this is the
part of your thinking,

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
which goes well beyond
orthodox theoretical biology.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Say a bit more about that.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the orthodox view is
that all these amazing forms

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and all the behavior and
instincts that the animals

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
expressed were all coded
in the chemical genes.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So a materialist theory.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a materialist theory.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I think it goes far
beyond that and involves

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.605 align:middle line:84%
a memory of instincts, a memory
of behavior, a memory of form.

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That is not materially-based.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Not materially-based-- a
collective memory on which each

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.966 align:middle line:90%
species draws.

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:54.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Rup, so here we are,
in the Hall of Paleontology.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.240 align:middle line:84%
This is sort of the archive of
all these morphogenetic forms

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:84%
that have persisted
through time.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Can you say how your
notions go beyond

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Darwinian and Mendelian genetics
and evolutionary theory?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I agree with the
conventional theory that there

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:84%
are genes that are
important to inheritance.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.040 align:middle line:84%
They give each organism
the chemicals it needs.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
But as well as that,
you see, there's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.610 align:middle line:84%
the morphic fields,
the organizing fields

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:90%
of these forms.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And the form like we see in
these shapes, here, are all

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.170 align:middle line:90%
determined by the fields.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
They determine the
way organisms develop.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:90%
These are all extinct types.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.125 align:middle line:84%
And I would say that
the memory is not

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:84%
only inherent in the
species while they're alive.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Even after they're dead,
even after they're extinct,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.030 align:middle line:84%
the world is still
filled with, as it

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.810 align:middle line:84%
were, the ghosts of extinct
species, memories of species

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:90%
that no longer exist.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So the memories of
evolution are cumulative.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
They build up.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we see, in
the course of evolution,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
extinct forms of shellfish,
for example, come back again

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:90%
after 10, 20 million years.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.170 align:middle line:10%
These are called evolutionary
iterations, evolution repeats.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're explained in terms
of atavism, the recapturing

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.010 align:middle line:90%
of ancient memories.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.400 align:middle line:84%
>> But in a sense, you're
saying that after the species is

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.710 align:middle line:84%
extinct, but the fossil form
lives on, then it is somehow

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.235 align:middle line:84%
a catalyst to this
recursion of form.

00:04:40.235 --> 00:04:42.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an entire
memory built into nature.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
The world, as it were,
haunted by the ghosts

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.510 align:middle line:90%
of extinct species.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Each species is influenced
by all the past members

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:90%
of its species.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.610 align:middle line:84%
But behind that, all the
forms that have gone before,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.140 align:middle line:84%
which is why in the course
of embryonic development,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.420 align:middle line:84%
we see echoes of the embryonic
forms of remote ancestors.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
The way that we developed
through a fish-like stage

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:90%
or gills slips, and so on.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> But in a case like that, then
how is it possible for new form

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.672 align:middle line:90%
to emerge at all?

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is where novelty
comes in, of which, of course,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
we have to turn to you
for explanation of that.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> This morphic resonance
is theory of habit,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
which explains how things
repeat, through memories.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Habits build up in
species through instincts

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and through forms.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And habits, normally,
just go on repeating

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:90%
and repeating and repeating.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Most species last for about 14
to 20 million years and then

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:90%
become extinct.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And a few of them leave
traces like the ones

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:90%
who see fossils in these cases.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.120 align:middle line:84%
But the creativity
of the formation

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of a new pattern, a new form,
involves this creative jump,

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:90%
the creation step.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
My own view of evolution is that
it's an interplay of creativity

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.530 align:middle line:90%
and habit.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.845 align:middle line:90%
Habit explains repetition.

00:06:10.845 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And most of life, most
of nature is repetition.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
But unless there's
novelty as well,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:90%
nothing would ever change.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.565 align:middle line:90%
So there has to be novelty, too.

00:06:21.565 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
To say that it's blind chance
is the conventional view,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
tells us very little,
almost nothing.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It's really just simply saying,
novelty is unintelligible.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:84%
There are different ways
of thinking of the it.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
The founders of
paleontology, like Cuvier,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
the great fossil pioneers, the
pioneers of this kind of museum

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
had thought that they
were all reflections

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
of platonic archetypal
forms, timeless forms.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.370 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't really
explain creativity.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:57.370 align:middle line:84%
It would simply say they
were preexisting forms

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.440 align:middle line:90%
that were merely manifested.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Other people would
think of creativity

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.580 align:middle line:84%
as going on as
evolution proceeds.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.940 align:middle line:84%
So a bird like this
didn't exist at one time.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, usually by a sudden
jump, it would appear,

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
and then, through repetition,
would become increasingly

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:90%
habitual, then become extinct.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And the potential habits, the
memory would persist in nature,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.445 align:middle line:90%
but it wouldn't be expressed.

00:07:21.445 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, tell me this--

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.280 align:middle line:84%
do you think that a person
holding this point of view

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.360 align:middle line:84%
has a license for more
optimism than people

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to operate in the
ordinary scientific paradigm?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
how does this idea

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.020 align:middle line:84%
reflect back into the dilemma
of the human world, here

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.752 align:middle line:84%
at the brink of the
third millennium?

00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, several ways--

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
firstly, this theory leaves
the nature of creativity open.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.700 align:middle line:84%
It may be blind chance, but
it could be anything else,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.767 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, there could be
a directing intelligence.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:84%
All we know is that
new things appear.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.230 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how they appear.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, it tells us that habit
is a very important principle

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.160 align:middle line:84%
in nature, and it makes
us aware of the importance

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.250 align:middle line:84%
of our own habits,
personal and cultural.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.450 align:middle line:84%
But thirdly, the theory tells
us when new things happen,

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.030 align:middle line:84%
by morphic resonance, they
can spread around the world

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
much more quickly than they
might otherwise be able to.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And this could be a
ground for optimism.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.190 align:middle line:84%
It means that change can happen
faster than we might otherwise

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:90%
believe.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.005 align:middle line:84%
And fast change seems to be very
necessary if we're to survive.

00:08:38.005 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying
is we don't have to rely

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:84%
on mechanisms like cultural
fusion or direct communication.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
These new concepts, new
paradigms are in the air,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:90%
as it were.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and of course,
we all know about modern

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.730 align:middle line:84%
telecommunications and
the modern mass media.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But morphic resonance means
that new attitudes, new patterns

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.230 align:middle line:84%
of behavior can spread
much quicker than one

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.862 align:middle line:90%
might otherwise have thought.

00:09:05.862 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, tell me this, then,
how is the theory of morphic

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.700 align:middle line:90%
resonance doing?

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:84%
Is it behaving according to
its own predicted trajectory,

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.470 align:middle line:84%
or is it meeting
unexpected resistance?

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's meeting
expected resistance.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.000 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] I see.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> But the idea certainly
seems to be catching on.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a sense in which
this idea of a kind of habit

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
appeals to people.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.540 align:middle line:84%
It makes sense, the idea of
a collective memory, the idea

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:84%
that what we learn is like a
kind of remembering of what

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.500 align:middle line:84%
others have learned is
intuitive and plausible

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to me and to many other people.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And I would say,
certainly the idea

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
is getting easier
to explain than it

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.680 align:middle line:90%
was when I first thought of it.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've heard it said that
it very elegantly and neatly

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
solves problems which are
insoluble by any other means

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.960 align:middle line:90%
in biology.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Could you just name a
couple of these areas

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.211 align:middle line:84%
where it makes
clarity out of chaos?

00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are many-- one
is the development of form

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.300 align:middle line:84%
in embryos, the way that a
bird like this could grow from

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:90%
an egg.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And how any organism develops
from an egg is a great mystery.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of morphogenetic
fields, form-shaping fields

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:84%
is the basis of
the whole theory.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:90%
That's what I started from.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it helps to explain
the problem of form.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:84%
It helps to explain the
inheritance of instincts,

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:84%
as well, how new patterns of
behavior develop and spread.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.858 align:middle line:84%
So these are two of the
areas that it helps.

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So is that the non-material
presupposition that makes it

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:03.210 align:middle line:84%
so difficult for orthodox
science to accept this into its

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:90%
canon?

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's the idea of a kind
of non-material memory on which

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
each member of the species
draws, and in turn,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
to which it contributes.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.330 align:middle line:84%
It's very like Jung's idea of
the collective unconscious.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:84%
This is an idea
that's, in one form,

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.280 align:middle line:90%
familiar to people already.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But because modern
science is steeped

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:84%
in a kind of materialistic
way of thinking, the idea

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:84%
that everything has to involve
material and material transfer,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.450 align:middle line:84%
is very important for
a lot of scientists.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in the light
of modern physics,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.240 align:middle line:90%
it's a very old-fashioned idea.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.290 align:middle line:84%
To get a television program
from the transmitting station

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.990 align:middle line:84%
to the receiving set
doesn't involve couriers

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.660 align:middle line:90%
carrying cans and videotape.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:84%
It goes through as
vibrations through a field.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
radio and television

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
have broken this out in
our everyday thinking

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.120 align:middle line:84%
from the 19th century
materialistic paradigm,

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
because fields and vibratory
connections through fields

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
are now the stuff
of everyday life.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that all forms
of information transfer

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
have to involve material
is no longer tenable.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But many people's
scientific thinking,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
including that of
many scientists,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:84%
is still locked into a kind
of 19th-century materialism.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, probably because the
theory of genetics has been

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:84%
so successful, and it is a
theory of material particles,

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
it sounds as though biology has
been dragging its feet somewhat

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:84%
behind physics, in terms of
its acceptance of field theory.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, model neo-Darwinian
theory is based

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.130 align:middle line:84%
on the discoveries of
geneticists in the 1910s,

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
and following Mendel
in the 1850s and 60s.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on old style
atomistic particulates theory.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
The whole basic
way of thinking was

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
formed long before quantum
theory came into being

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.360 align:middle line:84%
and it takes almost no
account of modern developments

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.410 align:middle line:90%
in physics.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It takes almost no account of
modern cosmology-- the idea

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.150 align:middle line:84%
that the laws of nature could
evolve along with the cosmos.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.270 align:middle line:84%
It's locked into an earlier
form of classical physics.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I think what I'm suggesting
is much more in accordance

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.890 align:middle line:84%
with the modern
spirit of physics.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Whereas most of biology
is still an attempt

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.230 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the phenomena of
life to high school physics,

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially
classical physics

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.190 align:middle line:90%
of the 19th century time.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, essentially, you're
attempting to go beyond

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:90%
reductionism, it sounds.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.965 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I think so.

00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are your
expectations for success?

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, are there
experimental strategies

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
which are supporting
this point of view,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:90%
or is it largely theory?

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Where do you stand with it?

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, experiments are going
on in the realm of morphic

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.995 align:middle line:84%
resonance, principally
in the realm of behavior,

00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:05.650 align:middle line:84%
at the moment-- animal
behavior, human behavior.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But the theory applies
to crystals, as well as

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.070 align:middle line:90%
to plants and animals.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
And chemical tests are some of
the most potentially exciting.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:21.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing some work on crystal
forms and crystal phenomena.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:84%
The main experiments that
are in the human realm,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
so far, they've been
very encouraging.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.290 align:middle line:84%
They suggest that people
can learn more quickly what

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:90%
others have already learned.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's also the
area where the theory

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:35.130 align:middle line:84%
could be most
immediately applied,

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.730 align:middle line:90%
for example, in education.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the theory seems to
imply that it's own correctness

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:46.050 align:middle line:84%
depends largely on its
being heard and repeated.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:50.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the theory implies
that the more is heard,

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the easier it will be for people
to get, to grasp the theory,

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:90%
to understand it.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's true.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> And so it seems to be.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So it seems to be.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> So it seems to be.
