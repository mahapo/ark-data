>> As exciting as the new
advances in the longevity space

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:84%
are, we're not at a point yet
of having a magic pill that will

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.170 align:middle line:84%
miraculously make us
healthy and young again.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.988 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, we should probably
not forget about the basics.

00:00:36.988 --> 00:00:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS BUMSTEAD: My
name is Chris Bumsted.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And I am a four time
Mr. Olympia bodybuilder.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I compete in the classic
physique division.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470 align:middle line:84%
So I've been competing in
bodybuilding for 10 years

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.570 align:middle line:84%
now as a professional
bodybuilder for six years.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's a full-time job.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It's treating food the way
you eat like a full-time job,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
training like a full-time
job, and sleep and recovery

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:90%
like a full-time job.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And over time, I also
began to incorporate

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:84%
caring about my health rather
than just the physical image

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:90%
of my physique.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.855 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
really started to get

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:08.313 align:middle line:84%
into the benefits
of longevity hacking

00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and the beauty of focusing on
your health rather than just

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.530 align:middle line:90%
an image.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So I absolutely believe
exercise, especially lifting

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:84%
weights and building
muscle, helps

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.170 align:middle line:84%
in the longevity of
your health as a human

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:84%
and I think more so than
just living a long time

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
but actually being
healthy for a long time

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and being able to
function in the world

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.622 align:middle line:84%
the way you want to so you're
not stuck in a hospital bed

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
or stuck at home in bed
or something like that.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:10%
But the more muscle
you have, the stronger

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:10%
your body is, the more you can
fight off disease and illness,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.320 align:middle line:10%
the less likely you are
to fall, the more likely

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:10%
you are when you fall to
be able to recover quicker

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:10%
because one of the earliest
signs of deaths in someone

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:10%
is when they fall.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.580 align:middle line:10%
They break a hip or a leg
or something like that.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.477 align:middle line:84%
Once you're over
the age of like 70,

00:01:46.477 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:84%
it's really hard to
recover from that.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:10%
And the more muscle you
have, the more likely

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.480 align:middle line:10%
you are to catch
yourself not from fall.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And if you do, also to
recover or not hurt yourself.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
So I think it is so
important to exercise

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.460 align:middle line:90%
throughout your entire life.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.665 align:middle line:84%
Eat a high protein
diet, exercise hard,

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
put weight bearing
loads so that you're

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
able to maintain
that muscle mass.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:10%
And of course, cardiovascular
health through your endurance

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.228 align:middle line:10%
is also very important
to keep your heart

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:09.060 align:middle line:10%
working overtime,
keep your heart strong

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.389 align:middle line:10%
and pumping like it needs to.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TONY ROBBINS:
Building muscle mass--

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:90%
also direct relationship--

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
I put in the books, in Life
Force, several studies that show

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:90%
it directly relates to cancer.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Your muscle mass plays a bigger
role than you have any idea.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
just looking good.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:90%
It's about strength.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's about vitality.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's about your metabolism.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that every person has

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.640 align:middle line:90%
got to take care of themselves.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Work out three times a week.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Make a commitment.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.790 align:middle line:90%
And don't miss it.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Have it a certain
day, a certain time.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:84%
It's a schedule,
like anything else.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And once it becomes a
habit, it becomes easy.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And then if you don't
do it, you crave it.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.078 align:middle line:84%
>>CHRIS MIRABILE: Exercise
is important on both

00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:41.830 align:middle line:84%
the microscopic and
on the macro level.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:84%
On the microscopic level, it
is stressing your mitochondria,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.570 align:middle line:90%
the power plants of your cells.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's making more powerful,
resilient mitochondria.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.200 align:middle line:84%
One of the 12
hallmarks of aging is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:90%
the aging of your mitochondria.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:10%
And then on the more
physiological level,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:10%
it is leading to better
circulation, better heart

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:10%
health, even neurogenesis--
so new neurons

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.272 align:middle line:10%
being formed from exercise.

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:10%
>>BUMSTEAD: One thing
you learn in bodybuilding

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:10%
is that you can't
out diet no training.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can't out
train bad dieting.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
They don't really
counteract each other.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.378 align:middle line:84%
And you could eat as
healthy as possible.

00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:14.420 align:middle line:90%
Or you could eat nothing.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.960 align:middle line:90%
You could fast.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.210 align:middle line:90%
You could do all these things.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And you really need to push
your body to new limits

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
to continue to grow and
be as strong as possible.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.300 align:middle line:10%
And no one really gets too old
and wishes they had less muscle

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.450 align:middle line:10%
or wishes they were weaker.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Usually wish you were feeling
a little bit stronger,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:90%
a little bit more robust.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:10%
And that's something that only
really comes from exercise.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.495 align:middle line:84%
>>MARK CUBAN: I
actually work out

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:36.980 align:middle line:84%
more now than I did 10
years ago or 15 years ago

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.450 align:middle line:90%
because my body needs it more.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's anywhere
from 45 to 90 minutes plus

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:90%
trying to walk places.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
When we're on the
set of Shark Tank,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
everybody else is
taking the carts.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:90%
The set is 0.35 miles away.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.315 align:middle line:90%
And I'm walking back and forth.

00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So I'm walking two miles a day
while we're shooting Shark Tank.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.848 align:middle line:84%
If I never had to look in the
mirror, I'd think I was 35.

00:03:56.848 --> 00:03:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>TONY HORTON: Especially as
you get into your 30s, 40s, 50s,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
60s, and beyond, if you're
not moving physically,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:90%
then you become limited.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.342 align:middle line:90%
Your range of motion decreases.

00:04:04.342 --> 00:04:05.690 align:middle line:90%
Your strength decreases.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.283 align:middle line:90%
Your flexibility decreases.

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
a lot of the things

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.780 align:middle line:84%
that you want to try and
do are inevitably too hard.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.867 align:middle line:84%
And so then your world gets
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:04:14.867 --> 00:04:16.700 align:middle line:84%
That's going to keep
you young and youthful.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The things that I can
physically do at 60, almost 64,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't do in my
teens, 20s, or 30s.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.640 align:middle line:90%
But I can do it now.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, how long
am I going to live?

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.240 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'd like to
live into my 90s.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.550 align:middle line:90%
Who knows, maybe beyond that.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not really so
much about longevity.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about quality of life where
I am right here and right now.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But the end result is, I
mean, here I am in my 60s,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.365 align:middle line:90%
feeling better than ever.

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.282 align:middle line:84%
>>NIR BARZILAI: The first
thing is I exercise.

00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And I actually
exercise every day.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Exercise at any age is maybe
the most important intervention.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Moving-- OK, you have
to move all the time.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.607 align:middle line:84%
It has a huge effect
on the healthspan.

00:04:53.607 --> 00:04:55.690 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBBINS: Listen, you
don't move, you don't live.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you all the wonderful
things you can do biochemically

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:90%
for your body.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's no replacement
still for exercise and movement.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.650 align:middle line:84%
I think it's not
just about medicine.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:90%
It's about us doing our part.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.732 align:middle line:10%
But today, most people
don't do their part.

00:05:06.732 --> 00:05:08.315 align:middle line:84%
>>MORGAN LAVINE: I
always say, if they

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
could bottle the
effects of exercise,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
it would be the hottest kind of
therapeutic and aging research.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.655 align:middle line:84%
>>BRAD STANFIELD:
I could get all

00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:84%
of my patients to be exercising
at least half an hour a day.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.012 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd see half the
patients in the clinic

00:05:20.012 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
because most of them wouldn't
need to come to see me.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.262 align:middle line:84%
>>STEVE AOKI: When I think
about quality of life,

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
the baseline has to
start with energy.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.482 align:middle line:84%
Once you have abundant amount
of energy, then you live life.

00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>WILL AHMED: If you're just
getting started on your health

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and fitness journey or
you're a weekend warrior

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
but now you want to
really understand

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.760 align:middle line:84%
what it takes for that longer
longevity, the first thing to do

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.060 align:middle line:84%
is to start measuring some
key metrics about your body,

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.000 align:middle line:84%
understanding your sleep, your
resting heart rate, your heart

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:84%
rate variability, your VO2 max,
measuring these things over time

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what about
your lifestyle today

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:84%
is changing them, and
then starting to implement

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:90%
very specific changes.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.425 align:middle line:90%
Could be to exercise.

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
It could be to
your sleep routine.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.550 align:middle line:90%
Could be to your diet.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden
starting to see improvement

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:90%
in these metrics.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.580 align:middle line:84%
That will be
incredibly motivating

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.135 align:middle line:84%
and give you the feedback
that you need to improve.

00:06:13.135 --> 00:06:15.800 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:84%
>> What if one day we could
press a button and print a new

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
heart or a new liver from
our own live cultured cells?

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
That would be pretty
amazing, right?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And that reality might actually
be closer than we think.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.390 align:middle line:84%
>>PETER DIAMANDIS: So today, if
you need a heart, liver, lung,

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.530 align:middle line:84%
kidney transplant, you're
waiting for someone to die

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and then hoping that you're
on the transplant list.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going to
be that way for long.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing
is incredible work.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, what if you could
engineer the surface antigens

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
so that you can take a
pig heart or a pig kidney

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and transplant it to a human
and have it not be rejected?

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.910 align:middle line:90%
It works the same.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the goal here-- and
it's happening right now.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not perfected yet
but, inside this decade,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
we will see it, where if
you're on a transplant list,

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.330 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to wait
for someone to perish.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
There are going to be
organs made available to you

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
that can keep you alive
for years, maybe decades.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Another technology--
this comes from the work

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
of Dr. Dean Kamen, the Advanced
Regenerative Manufacturing

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:29.140 align:middle line:84%
He's built technology that can
take a pluripotent stem cell,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.410 align:middle line:84%
take one of your
skin cells, turn it

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.450 align:middle line:84%
into what's called an induced
pluripotent stem cell,

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:84%
put it in one end
of the machine.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:84%
The machine replicates that
stem cell billions of fold

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.960 align:middle line:84%
and then has those stem
cells differentiate

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
in the proper fashion and
then manufactures an organ.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
Imagine being able to
go from a skin biopsy

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:84%
to a new heart for yourself
or kidney or liver or lung.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It's an extraordinary time.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.800 align:middle line:84%
>> How many times have you woken
up refreshed after sleeping

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:84%
for 8 to 10 hours or felt like a
zombie after a sleepless night?

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.030 align:middle line:84%
This contrast tells us how
important sleep is to our bodies

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.910 align:middle line:84%
and that perhaps it can
even affect our longevity.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRYAN JOHNSON: The
longevity therapies

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm most excited about are
sleep, diet, and exercise.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.378 align:middle line:84%
They're the most uninteresting
and basic components

00:08:24.378 --> 00:08:26.670 align:middle line:84%
that no one wants to hear
about because everybody wants

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to hear about the magic drug.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.659 align:middle line:10%
But they're the three
things nobody's doing.

00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:32.159 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBERT GOLDMAN:
I believe sleep is

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
very important for good health.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Because during sleep, you
release growth hormone.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.417 align:middle line:84%
And you have to give the
body a chance to reanimate.

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of hormonal and
other mechanisms of restoration

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.397 align:middle line:90%
that occur during sleep.

00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AHMED: Slow wave
sleep and REM sleep

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:84%
are really the two most
important periods of sleep.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Slow wave sleep is more
focused on repairing

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:90%
your muscles and your body.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And REM sleep is getting your
mind to repair cognitively.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.290 align:middle line:90%
It's also when you're dreaming.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So people who say they
can't remember their dreams

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.050 align:middle line:84%
or they don't think they
dream, they're probably

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:90%
not getting enough REM sleep.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But both these periods of
sleep are incredibly important.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.920 align:middle line:84%
>>AOKI: But I've fucked my
sleep off for so many years.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.230 align:middle line:90%
My REM is just pretty poor.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to figure
that out the best

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:84%
I can so that my energy
is as full as possible

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.852 align:middle line:90%
from renewable source.

00:09:18.852 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>>TONY HAWK: People will say
like, oh, we're having dinner.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.110 align:middle line:90%
It starts at 8:00.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:90%
Like 8:00?

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.910 align:middle line:90%
Are you kidding me?

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We are so heading upstairs at
8:00 to go to bed because I

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.792 align:middle line:84%
lived a life where I
was always exhausted.

00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's like you're burning
the candle at both ends.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.840 align:middle line:90%
And it catches up to you.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, you can
pay the price in a heavy way,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.090 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
doing what I do.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.992 align:middle line:84%
>>ROBBINS: I used to say,
I'll sleep when I die.

00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I used to sleep five hours,
five and a half hours

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.820 align:middle line:84%
to be my max, and sometimes
four, which is not good.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.910 align:middle line:90%
You can't sustain that.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And I think everybody has
variance in their capacity.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.403 align:middle line:84%
But when I was doing
Life Force, of course,

00:09:53.403 --> 00:09:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I had to do the
homework on sleep.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I interviewed some of the
top sleep experts in the world.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
said to me, Tony,

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.807 align:middle line:84%
I'll prove to you,
beyond a shadow

00:09:59.807 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
of a doubt, the value
of more hours of sleep.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK, tell me.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
He goes, we did a study
on 1.6 billion people.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:90%
I said, that's total BS.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
No one did a study of
1.6 billion people.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.790 align:middle line:90%
He said, yes, we did.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:13.420 align:middle line:84%
All the countries where people
have daylight savings time.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you'll find
this in every single country.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:84%
When we spring forward and you
lose an hour, the next day,

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.920 align:middle line:84%
in the next 24 hours, there's a
24% increase in heart attacks.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And he went through
all their statistics--

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:90%
car accidents, everything.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.240 align:middle line:84%
What's crazy is when
we fall back and get

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.890 align:middle line:84%
one hour extra in the fall,
the exact number, 23%,

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
is where the 1% change
goes the other way,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:90%
meaning less heart attacks.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
So if one hour of sleep can do
that, I started saying, hmm.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.253 align:middle line:90%
So now, I work to get six.

00:10:43.253 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>>BUMSTEAD: Because sleep
is such an important thing

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.420 align:middle line:90%
for longevity.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
I think if you're trying to
live a long, healthy lifestyle,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
stress reduction
and sleep are some

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
of the two most important and
easy things that you can apply.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Within that, obviously, there's
different cues and things

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:90%
that help.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.460 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I like to
just make sure stress

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
is as low as possible when
I get close to bedtime.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So I stay away from stuff
like social media, blue light,

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
my phone, anything like that.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.900 align:middle line:84%
I just try and
really decompress,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.108 align:middle line:84%
whether it's through meditation
or just spending time

00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:11.610 align:middle line:90%
with my dog and my fiancée.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.497 align:middle line:84%
I wear these blue
light blocking glasses,

00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:15.580 align:middle line:84%
which prevent blue light
from coming in your eyes.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.235 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel
your brain relax

00:11:17.235 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
as you put those on
because you're preventing

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.830 align:middle line:84%
any harsh lights
coming into your body

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
because, naturally,
humans were meant

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
to go sleep when the sun came
down and when it came back up.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And now, with artificial
light and everything,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.200 align:middle line:84%
we've kind of thrown off
our circadian rhythm.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: I'm in the 99.4
percentile of quality sleepers.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we just got good
sleep, the world may change.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.960 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, we're gravitated
towards this supplement

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
or that supplement or this
magic pill or that magic pill.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
But mastering the basic thing
of sleep is just beyond reach.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we can just
take the simplest thing

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and get that right
in our lives--

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:90%
we all know that.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
The difference between hope and
despair is a good night's sleep.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.417 align:middle line:84%
>>NICO HELLING:
Studies in Germany

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
have shown that more than
80% of the population

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.740 align:middle line:84%
suffers from chronic
sleep deprivation.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Sleep is extremely important
for the body to recover.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:84%
>>AHMED: It's now proven that
good sleep increases longevity.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
A study just as
recently as 2023 showed

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.870 align:middle line:84%
that getting quality sleep
increases lifespan for men

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:84%
by just over four years and
for women by over two years.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABILE: It's been found that
if people have inadequate sleep,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:27.600 align:middle line:84%
in the short term, it can
cause metabolic disturbances--

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:84%
for example, higher
blood glucose

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.187 align:middle line:84%
levels after as little as two
days of interrupted sleep.

00:12:33.187 --> 00:12:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SANDRA KAUFMANN: So the
connection between sleep

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and aging is absolutely key.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:39.390 align:middle line:84%
As a consequence
of not sleeping,

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.720 align:middle line:84%
you don't give yourself
the time to make proteins

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.490 align:middle line:90%
that are constructed at night.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.860 align:middle line:84%
Up to 30% of proteins are in
fact constructed at night.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:10%
So you're limiting your
repair capacity in essence.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's been demonstrated that
people that don't sleep well

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
or that work night shifts have
a higher propensity for cancer.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVINE: So sleep
is something that

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:84%
actually gets ignored probably
a lot more than it should.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.282 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
sleep quantity.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the number of
hours that people are sleeping.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the
quality of that sleep.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So do you have
interrupted sleep?

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Or can you actually have
a full kind of night sleep

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.320 align:middle line:90%
without interruption.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.440 align:middle line:84%
>>AHMED: Well, studies
show that inadequate sleep

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and particularly
inadequate quality sleep,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:84%
which is getting this
restorative sleep,

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.150 align:middle line:84%
is correlated with virtually all
these different disease states

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and forms of lack of
cognitive function.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:84%
So getting quality sleep
is about as foundational

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:32.450 align:middle line:84%
as there is to living a
happy and performative life.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.970 align:middle line:84%
>>DIAMANDIS: If we could have
done with less sleep, frankly,

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
evolution would have
gotten rid of it.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.480 align:middle line:84%
>>WIM HOF: That's why we are
always so active and thinking

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.375 align:middle line:84%
and you cannot
stop and [GROANS].

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:48.590 align:middle line:84%
And when we want to go
sleep, we have no peace.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It's because of the cortisol.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.020 align:middle line:90%
You take a cold shower.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.333 align:middle line:90%
You will sleep like a baby.

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHNSON: So here would
be my tips for sleep.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
One, if you can, sleep
in a room by yourself.

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm fortunate that I can.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:90%
Not everyone can.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Do I think sleeping with our
partners is potentially dated?

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.000 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if we actually look
at all of our habits society,

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.340 align:middle line:84%
we live the traditions
of dead people.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:84%
We do so much of what's been
done for hundreds of years.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.290 align:middle line:90%
And little of it is questioned.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
trying to synchronize

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:90%
two people in one room--

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:84%
bedtimes, wake up
times, disturbances--

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:84%
it's a difficult
thing to manage.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has the luxury
of having their own sleep area.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But where it's possible, I
strongly suggest people do it.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Number two, black out your room.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:90%
No light.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Number three is no alcohol.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.290 align:middle line:90%
It destroys your sleep.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Four is be mindful of
how close you eat to bed.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I currently fast for about
10 hours, which is a lot.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:90%
But try to eat.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Give some time separation
from your last meal

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.560 align:middle line:90%
to when you go to sleep.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And then five is I do a
temperature-controlled room

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:90%
or mattress.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Controlling temperature for
sleep is really helpful.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, go to sleep
at the same time every day

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.510 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABILE: So I have connected
light bulbs that change

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:90%
color an hour before bedtime.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:90%
And they turn red.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So it looks a little bit
like the red light district.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.300 align:middle line:84%
But it actually helps to
produce melatonin in my body.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And so when I do put my
head down on the pillow,

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I fall asleep quickly.

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
I wear earplugs so
that no outside noise

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.100 align:middle line:84%
or family members that might be
moving around will disturb me.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I also have a
sleep mask on, again,

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
so that no light comes
in contact with my retina

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.980 align:middle line:90%
even with my eyes closed.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>AHMED: Now, we're
at this amazing era

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:90%
in the history of technology.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:84%
We're in a very small,
tiny form factor.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.760 align:middle line:84%
You can actually continuously
measure your sleep

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and understand what are all
the behaviors that you're doing

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.050 align:middle line:90%
to maximize restorative sleep.

00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:10%
>> According to experts, it
seems like a lot of diseases are

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.280 align:middle line:10%
related to inflammation.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.100 align:middle line:90%
So what is inflammation?

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And how does it affect aging?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:10%
>>HOF: Inflammation
is a product,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:03.420 align:middle line:10%
a consequence of our immune
system trying to find

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.860 align:middle line:10%
an answer for intruders.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know where it is.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And then the body becomes
in the alarm condition.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle line:10%
And that alarm condition
is inflammation.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.130 align:middle line:10%
So that affects
the immune cells.

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
>>KAUFMANN: Because your immune
system, when you are younger,

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.830 align:middle line:84%
does a very good job of
protecting you from the evils

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:25.680 align:middle line:90%
of the world--

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:90%
pathogens, et cetera.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:84%
As you get older, it
sort of turns on you.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And you become more
inflamed and less

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.220 align:middle line:90%
able to fight off infection.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And inflammation is just
absolutely horrid on the body.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:90%
It releases more free radicals.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:90%
It creates DNA damage.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the main
tenets of blocking aging

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:45.647 align:middle line:84%
is to decrease the
inflammatory process.

00:16:45.647 --> 00:16:47.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REASON: So your
innate immune system

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.210 align:middle line:84%
is just running
around constantly

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.930 align:middle line:84%
in your later life
saying, oh God,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.250 align:middle line:90%
this place is falling apart.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.685 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big problem.

00:16:53.685 --> 00:16:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And turning that
off is something

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.727 align:middle line:84%
which people that
people are only really

00:16:56.727 --> 00:16:58.280 align:middle line:90%
just starting to get a grip on.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
Which of these
levers do we maybe

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
think we can turn to stop
it reacting in this way?

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.010 align:middle line:84%
>>STANFIELD: We're going to
be causing things like heart

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:90%
disease, cancer, and diabetes.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.540 align:middle line:84%
So we want to try and
minimize inflammation as much

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.270 align:middle line:84%
as possible so that we can
age better and, again, weather

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.097 align:middle line:84%
those attacks in the
future a little bit better.

00:17:16.097 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:10%
>>MOMCHILO VUYISICH:
So it can, for example,

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.410 align:middle line:10%
cause leaky gut and leaky gums
and leaky blood brain barrier.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:10%
It can actually attack
its own organs, which

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.720 align:middle line:10%
is what we call
autoimmune diseases,

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:10%
such as rheumatoid arthritis.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
It can cause inflammation,
such as inflammatory bowel

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:33.710 align:middle line:84%
disease, and then all these
neurodegenerative diseases.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.000 align:middle line:84%
So all of those, even
metabolic disease and obesity,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.265 align:middle line:84%
are very likely caused
by inflammation.

00:17:39.265 --> 00:17:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>NAVEEN JAIN: What is the
purpose of inflammation?

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Why do we even have
this inflammation?

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, guess what?

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.720 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have inflammation,
we would die of wounds.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:84%
So inflammation is
really good when

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.100 align:middle line:90%
it is needed for a short term.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So you get wounded,
it becomes red.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.580 align:middle line:84%
That's inflammation, to stop
the bacteria from actually

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.090 align:middle line:90%
getting inside the body.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But a chronic
inflammation that we

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.050 align:middle line:84%
are having due to our lifestyle,
the modern lifestyle, that

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:90%
is what's causing us to age.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.320 align:middle line:90%
What causes those inflammation?

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:90%
Constant stress.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.247 align:middle line:84%
Our work environment
is stressful.

00:18:13.247 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people will tell
you their home environment

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.550 align:middle line:90%
is stressful.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's work that
causes us to stress.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:90%
And you go home.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And your spouse
causes to stress.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.920 align:middle line:10%
And then you suddenly
have stress all the time.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:90%
That causes inflammation.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think also the
nutrition that we

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:84%
are providing our body are in
fact getting less and less.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.260 align:middle line:90%
People used to live on a farm.

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.870 align:middle line:84%
They used to eat the food
that has a lot of fiber.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're eating all
the processed food.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And that is causing our body
not to have the nutrition.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, we now growing
the food that are full

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
of pesticides, full
of insecticides,

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:90%
full of antibiotics in the meat.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's causing us
now the whole ecosystem

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:55.935 align:middle line:90%
inside our body to be destroyed.

00:18:55.935 --> 00:18:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>>KAUFMANN: So there are many
ways to fight inflammation.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:00.650 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people started
at the dietary level.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And they tend to consume
foods and agents that are

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:90%
less inflammatory than others.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.460 align:middle line:84%
But once you are already
inflamed in your body,

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.830 align:middle line:84%
there are many molecular
agents that do this.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.040 align:middle line:84%
By far, I think the
best one is curcumin.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
>>LAVINE: Exercise seems to have
a big impact on inflammation.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.590 align:middle line:84%
So even though exercise
itself is a stressor,

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.010 align:middle line:90%
it's what we call hormetic.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:10%
So it's this mild
stressor that can actually

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.420 align:middle line:10%
have a beneficial
impact in the long run.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.140 align:middle line:10%
And one of those impacts is that
it seems to reduce inflammation.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Other things are
reducing stress.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So people who even experienced
these traumatic life events

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:84%
or have continued chronic
stress due to potentially

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
socioeconomic situations tend to
have more inflammatory profiles.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
>> A happy and healthy
mind yields a healthy body.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.900 align:middle line:84%
For millennia, people
have explored the role

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that our mind plays
on our bodies.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:84%
But could a healthy mindset
also affect our longevity?

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABILE: As recently as
2007, scientists and researchers

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:84%
did not believe that stress
could lead to chronic illnesses.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
But since then, a lot of
research has come out.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's been found
that stress can

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
lead to things like
cardiovascular disease,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune disorders,
and even cancer.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
The reason for this is
that, when we're stressed,

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.690 align:middle line:84%
we're disrupting the
circadian cortisol rhythm.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to
lead to a downregulation

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.350 align:middle line:84%
of the glucocorticoid receptors
in inflammatory cells.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Our bodies
were never designed

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.430 align:middle line:90%
to be constantly under stress.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.000 align:middle line:10%
And that's the
reason when you go

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.100 align:middle line:10%
home, what is the thing
people say before you eat?

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's do the blessing
or the prayer.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea was
to actually bring

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.590 align:middle line:84%
your body from sympathetic
mode into parasympathetic mode.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
That means get rid of
fight or flight response.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Be in the gratitude
so you actually

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.810 align:middle line:84%
now reduce your
stress so your body

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.267 align:middle line:90%
can start to digest the food.

00:20:59.267 --> 00:21:01.350 align:middle line:84%
>>KAUFMANN: What happens
is when you are stressed,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.630 align:middle line:84%
your body produces more
inflammatory cytokines.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.050 align:middle line:84%
You get increased cortisol
levels and a variety

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.950 align:middle line:90%
of other hormonal levels.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And those things create
a calamitous situation

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.530 align:middle line:90%
around your body.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>JAIN: Stress causes your gut
microbiome to go out of balance.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.720 align:middle line:10%
And then when your
microbiome is out of balance,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.040 align:middle line:10%
they actually change your
mind because your gut-brain

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:10%
axis constantly through
the vagus nerve-- they're

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.710 align:middle line:10%
communicating.

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is when the
ecosystem in your gut

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is imbalanced, you get
mental health issues.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.760 align:middle line:90%
And it causes inflammation.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BUMSTEAD: We live a
very fast paced lifestyle

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:90%
in this day and age.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.030 align:middle line:10%
We all want the next car, a
bigger house, a better job,

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.657 align:middle line:10%
working all day, losing sleep.

00:21:41.657 --> 00:21:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Then we're on our
phone, on Instagram,

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.380 align:middle line:90%
or on Facebook all night.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And we're constantly stimulated
by the stress in our body

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:90%
that we don't even realize it.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And living in a
constant state of stress

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.570 align:middle line:84%
is going to lead to
a state of disease.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So I truly think that being
able to retract yourself

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.460 align:middle line:84%
from that, be in
the present moment,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
slow yourself down sometimes,
be grateful for wherever you're

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:84%
at in life even if it's not
exactly where you want to be,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and just having a more abundant,
positive attitude rather

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
than a negative,
fearful attitude

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.410 align:middle line:84%
is something that is less
studied and less proven

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.410 align:middle line:84%
but I think we're
truly starting to see

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
can lead to a much longer and
healthier, happier lifestyle.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.500 align:middle line:10%
>>PETR SRAMEK: Stress management
and mental health is very

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.890 align:middle line:10%
important part of the longevity
approach because everything is

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:26.970 align:middle line:10%
interconnected, because you
cannot improve your mental state

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.140 align:middle line:10%
without improving your biology.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:10%
And you cannot improve enough
your biology without improving

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.010 align:middle line:10%
your mental state.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.093 align:middle line:10%
>>ROBBINS: The study today
that was just published

00:22:35.093 --> 00:22:38.070 align:middle line:10%
in the Smithsonian, which is
an echo of a study on 500,000

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.410 align:middle line:10%
people, said the reduction
of stress was the single most

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.210 align:middle line:10%
important thing.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.940 align:middle line:90%
But stress is very different.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Is it eustress or distress?

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.192 align:middle line:90%
Say you get excited.

00:22:46.192 --> 00:22:47.650 align:middle line:84%
That can be stressful
on your body.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:48.850 align:middle line:90%
Your adrenals fire off.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:49.780 align:middle line:84%
It can be stressful
on your body.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
enjoying yourself, it

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.980 align:middle line:84%
has a radically different
biochemical effect

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.120 align:middle line:84%
when it's distress and
you're really upset.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.430 align:middle line:84%
We need a certain amount
of stress to feel alive.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:84%
We need a certain amount
of stress to be healthy.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.570 align:middle line:90%
But it's the balance of stress.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And is that, again,
eustress or distress?

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.622 align:middle line:84%
It's amazing someone's attitude
and mindset about stress

00:23:06.622 --> 00:23:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and how that changes the
biochemistry of person

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.460 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

>>BUMSTEAD: I know a lot
of people anecdotally

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.310 align:middle line:84%
in my own life, such as my
grandparents, who-- they smoked.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:90%
And they drank.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.743 align:middle line:84%
But they had the
least stressful life.

00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:19.840 align:middle line:10%
They came from a town of a
population of 5,000 people.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.280 align:middle line:10%
There was no competitive nature.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.630 align:middle line:10%
You weren't trying to
beat your neighbor.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.190 align:middle line:10%
There was a large
sense of community.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.100 align:middle line:10%
And they're both 95 years old
and still healthy right now

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.760 align:middle line:10%
and not applying any
longevity tricks or anything

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.420 align:middle line:10%
other than living
a stress-free life.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.813 align:middle line:84%
>>HAWK: Yeah, I think that
people need to find their zen.

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's not like
finding your sport

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.050 align:middle line:90%
or what are you good at.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It's more like, what gives
you a feeling of peace?

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.790 align:middle line:10%
And what gives you a
feeling of centered?

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
Once you do it and
you walk away and you

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
know that that re-energized you
and that you have a clear mind

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and that you can now
solve problems that

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.700 align:middle line:84%
were in your life,
whatever that thing is,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
make sure you try to do
it on a regular basis.

>>AHMED: The most powerful
tool I've found in my life

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.590 align:middle line:84%
for improving stress has
been learning to meditate.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.530 align:middle line:84%
This can be a practice for
as short as 5 or 10 minutes.

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It could be as
long as 20 minutes.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.110 align:middle line:84%
But it really allows you
to sit with your thoughts

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.440 align:middle line:90%
and just breathe.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.040 align:middle line:10%
And what you learn to
develop in this process

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:10%
is this third-person
perspective on how

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.530 align:middle line:10%
all these different things
that are going on in your mind

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:10%
are really operating.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:10%
And it gives you the ability
to control these thoughts

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.272 align:middle line:10%
and pass them through.

00:24:25.272 --> 00:24:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And what you find
when you actually

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.790 align:middle line:84%
measure the state of
meditating is it can often

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:90%
look a lot like quality sleep.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And it can often really
decrease your resting heart rate

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and increase your
heart rate variability,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.420 align:middle line:84%
which are key signs that
your body is actually

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.260 align:middle line:90%
in a performance state.

>>JOHN SALLEY: Managing stress--

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.800 align:middle line:10%
the best way of
doing it is yoga.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I tell you
that, when you're doing yoga,

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.420 align:middle line:84%
you have to listen
to your breath.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:84%
That means you can't
think about anything else.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.730 align:middle line:10%
>>BUMSTEAD: I would say
exercise definitely promotes

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.110 align:middle line:10%
good mental health and
helps stress management.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
endorphins and hormones

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that your body releases through
training hard and exercising

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.630 align:middle line:84%
hard, a lot of oxytocin
and serotonin your body

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:04.960 align:middle line:90%
just naturally releases.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:84%
You get a dopamine surge
from a heavy lifting

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.470 align:middle line:90%
workout and all these things.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And it naturally will
decrease your cortisol levels.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's also
a fact that if you

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.120 align:middle line:84%
go in with high cortisol
levels into the gym,

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:84%
your body can use that cortisol
to push through pain thresholds

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.100 align:middle line:90%
and train harder.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.600 align:middle line:10%
And in the end,
your cortisol levels

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:10%
will actually be even lower.

creativity, dance, movement,
exercise, mindset, joy--

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.790 align:middle line:84%
those things have biological
objective measures.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.610 align:middle line:84%
>>MIRABILE: So I
make sure that I

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.380 align:middle line:84%
minimize any toxic
relationships in my life.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Hopefully, I can eliminate them.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:10%
If not, I minimize my
time with those people.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:51.300 align:middle line:10%
And I maximize my time with
the positive people in my life.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes
to relationships,

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.840 align:middle line:90%
that does not exclude animals.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So I have my dog, Mia,
who I'm in love with.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And I find that even just
stopping for a second

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and giving her a hug or a kiss
really calms me down a lot.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:84%
