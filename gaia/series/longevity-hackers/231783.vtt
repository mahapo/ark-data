00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:84%
>> How old are you could soon
become an outdated question.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.650 align:middle line:84%
As people begin to implement
longevity and life extension

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.770 align:middle line:84%
therapies, their
biological age might soon

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:84%
become quite different from
their chronological age.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
According to scientists,
in just a few decades,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.920 align:middle line:84%
100 years old could
become the new 50.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The problem with
aging is everyone knows

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.910 align:middle line:90%
their chronological age.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But, really, what aging
researchers are interested in

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.290 align:middle line:84%
is this concept
of biological age.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.280 align:middle line:10%
So this is why we see
the rise in disease

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.350 align:middle line:10%
or the increase in mortality
risk as a function of age.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And it's this kind
of divergence, again,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.015 align:middle line:10%
away from this optimal state.

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So the best way to keep track
of whether your lifestyle is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
conducive to longevity is
with a biological age clock.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So there are multiple forms
of biological age clocks

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.060 align:middle line:84%
out there right now,
but the most accurate

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.405 align:middle line:90%
currently are epigenetic clocks.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> It's absolutely possible
to reverse the biological age,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and that has actually recently
been accomplished by several

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.730 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:90%
So there are two recent studies.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:10%
One, these are randomized
controlled trials that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:10%
were performed on older people.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Those people had
their biological age

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.990 align:middle line:84%
measured using one of
these biological clocks,

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:90%
molecular clocks.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they were put
on some kind of a program

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:84%
to try to slow down
or reverse the aging

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.820 align:middle line:90%
for a certain number of months.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:10%
And so the two trials that I
can remember very recently,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.620 align:middle line:10%
one used the human
growth hormone

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.653 align:middle line:10%
and in just a few
months, they were

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:10%
able to not just slow
down aging, but actually

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:10%
reverse it by two years
in a group of people.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:10%
Now, human growth hormone is
sort of a controversial drug

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:10%
because it can also cause
cancer so it's not something

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:10%
that everyone
would like to take.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But in another trial, people
used alpha ketoglutarate,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's just a
normal supplement.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:84%
They did sort of
overdose it a little bit.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
They used several grams
per day for several months.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But in that short
period, they actually

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
showed that they can not just
slow down aging, but reverse it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.190 align:middle line:90%
significantly.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.607 align:middle line:84%
I think it was something by a
year and a half or two years

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:21.755 align:middle line:90%
reversal in a few months.

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's take a guy
who's 55 years old.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.890 align:middle line:84%
He's 40 pounds overweight,
his cholesterol is sky high,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.150 align:middle line:90%
his LDL is are high.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.260 align:middle line:90%
He's out of breath.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.658 align:middle line:90%
He's in terrible shape.

00:02:30.658 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
His sexual function
is in the toilet.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.113 align:middle line:90%
The guy's a mess.

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:34.780 align:middle line:84%
We put him on the
right kind of program.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.030 align:middle line:10%
We do HRT, hormone
replacement therapy, on him.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:10%
We change his diet, he
loses the 40 pounds,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.560 align:middle line:10%
his cholesterol comes down,
his LDL has come down,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.820 align:middle line:10%
his HDL has come up.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.310 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, this
guy, physiologically,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.965 align:middle line:90%
is a different person.

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> What if one day
we could stop aging?

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And what would happen
when we get to that stage?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Do we become immortal?

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.092 align:middle line:90%
What would that even look like?

00:03:00.092 --> 00:03:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's amazing that we
as humanity have always had this

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.070 align:middle line:90%
fascination for living forever.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And that fascination
has never died.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
We are definitely at the cusp
of increasing our life span

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and health span.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.200 align:middle line:90%
There is no doubt in my mind.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing in our body
that says that when we turn 100,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:84%
we must die, or
130 or 150 or 200.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.430 align:middle line:84%
I really believe we will be
able to live as long as we want,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.270 align:middle line:84%
and we will be able to live
healthy as long as we want.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that is the
purpose worth living for.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you look
at telomere length,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.760 align:middle line:84%
they say the cap that you
can live is about 120 years.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So that's our genetically
programmed time

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.530 align:middle line:90%
to live as long as possible.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.410 align:middle line:84%
And there have been people who
have lived up to 120 years,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.330 align:middle line:84%
but that was without
any technology,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.950 align:middle line:90%
without any medical innovation.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Now we can alter
the genetics, we

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
can modify the
environment in which

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.390 align:middle line:84%
these telomeres are
attritioning, meaning

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:90%
they're becoming shorter.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So we can modify
that environment.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.280 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to know what the
maximum age will be because 120

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.255 align:middle line:90%
years is just our base.

00:04:10.255 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
have to work with.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.515 align:middle line:84%
That's what the raw materials
that we have in our body.

00:04:13.515 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
>> If you were to tell
most physicians or medical

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:84%
researchers in the year 1900
that we will soon have magic

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.620 align:middle line:84%
bullets that cure infectious
diseases, bacterial diseases,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.385 align:middle line:84%
it would have sounded
too optimistic.

00:04:26.385 --> 00:04:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me that our
ability to arrest aging is

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:90%
an inevitability.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.910 align:middle line:84%
Absent any catastrophic
events, stopping progress,

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:84%
biology is a
engineerable system.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
We have increasingly
powerful tools to interrogate

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:90%
biology, program biology.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It's different, it's more
complex than computer code,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.190 align:middle line:84%
it behaves differently
but there's

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
no reason to believe
that we will not

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.945 align:middle line:90%
be able to arrest aging.

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> All these science
fiction ideas of longevity,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
these ideas of living forever,
these ideas of merging

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.675 align:middle line:84%
into robots, becoming androids,
all these things actually could

00:05:02.675 --> 00:05:03.475 align:middle line:90%
happen.

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Immortality is already
possible at the level

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
of the cell, and it's been
that way for a billion years.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.870 align:middle line:84%
At this point, it's just
an engineering challenge

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of applying those
learnings to all

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.415 align:middle line:90%
of the cells in the human body.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:18.870 align:middle line:10%
>> For the first
time in history,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.850 align:middle line:10%
we are truly between the
last human mortal generation

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.615 align:middle line:10%
and the first human
immortal generation.

00:05:25.615 --> 00:05:30.083 align:middle line:10%
>> When science is extending
your life for more than a year,

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:31.500 align:middle line:10%
for every year
that you're alive--

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:10%
and that concept is called
longevity escape velocity--

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:10%
your goal should be how do you
live healthfully for the next 10

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.500 align:middle line:10%
or 20 years to intercept
the technologies coming

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:10%
that will then extend your
life the next 10 or 20 years.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Will we ever get to 500 years
of lifespan like the Greenland

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
shark or 200 years
like the bowhead whale?

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But what I feel confident
we can get to is being full

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:84%
of vitality and energy
and strong cognition,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.466 align:middle line:84%
aesthetics, mobility
at 100, maybe 120.

00:06:04.466 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> That sounds like
magic, sounds crazy.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil has been talking
about this for 30 years.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
He's been the most accurate
forecaster in the world

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:90%
for any form of technology.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I just talked to him the other
day, we're right on target.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And imagine what's
happening with AI.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's so many
breakthroughs that are coming

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.533 align:middle line:84%
and so much money being invested
by some of the wealthiest

00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:84%
people in the world
who understand money

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.800 align:middle line:84%
isn't everything because
if you're not here,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:90%
you don't have anything.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.455 align:middle line:84%
So Silicon Valley is
obsessed with this area.

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, since I was a kid,
I was a punk, hardcore kid.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Like, the punk motto is
live fast, die young.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I changed that motto.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once I knew
the possibility

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
of living indefinitely, I'm
like, I don't want to live fast,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:90%
die young.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.390 align:middle line:90%
I want to live fast, die never.

the current advances,

in 10 years we'll be

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.010 align:middle line:84%
I have full faith in the
ingenuity of our scientists.

I believe that if they
can do it to mice today,

then they'll be able
to do it to humans.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
able to enjoy the fruit of
this research pretty nicely.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.755 align:middle line:90%
And I'm looking forward to that.

00:07:49.755 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> For me I think
there's no way to tell.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, it's
amazing what humans

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:84%
are capable of doing that we
never thought was possible,

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.570 align:middle line:84%
but I think anyone who truly
says they know whether we can

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:84%
or can't I think is
probably mistaken,

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.240 align:middle line:84%
because there's no way to
predict what the future holds

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:84%
or what scientific discoveries
are going to come around.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have to just
work on these hard problems

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and wait and see
where they take us.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.240 align:middle line:90%
>> 60s are the new 40s.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:84%
You see guys my age in their
60s that can look good,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
can be fit and not be limited
in terms of things that they do.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And some people, they can't
put it at the top of their list

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.995 align:middle line:90%
simply because of economics.

00:08:31.995 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
You have some people,
unfortunately,

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.380 align:middle line:84%
have to worry about surviving
as opposed to thriving,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.070 align:middle line:84%
but some of us are
very, very fortunate

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to invest
to look at alternatives,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.575 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully one of
these things clicks.

00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:84%
>> It's happening
before our eyes,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's happening at a rate
that we could have never

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.520 align:middle line:90%
imagined.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.390 align:middle line:90%
It's wild.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm here for it.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
If I can stand on my
own two feet at age 100,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll stand on my skateboard.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.875 align:middle line:84%
I might be going slow, but
I'll still stand on it.

00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There's new science at the
forefront that's coming through

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.538 align:middle line:84%
now, which is about
reversing aging.

00:09:01.538 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
We're not just talking
about slowing aging,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:84%
we're actually about
turning back the clock.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And people dying
is like book burning.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
You're taking all of the
asset, all of the information

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.080 align:middle line:84%
that they've learned,
and you're destroying it.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.005 align:middle line:90%
And it's gone.

00:09:17.005 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Supplements are a
multi-billion dollar,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:90%
unregulated global industry.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And anyone can come up with
their own supplement these days.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So how can we know which
supplements are actually

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.322 align:middle line:84%
good for us and which ones could
potentially help with aging?

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So many people are under
the preconception that a very

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
healthy diet and exercise is
enough to help with longevity,

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:90%
and the answer is sort of.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:10%
Definitely a good
diet and exercise

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.687 align:middle line:10%
will help you avoid
a lot of disease

00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:10%
and it will help you with
longevity to a certain degree,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:10%
but it's truly not enough.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:84%
We know so much more in the
medical field about cells.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And as an example, we know
that taking pterostilbene,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
which comes from blueberries,
activates sirtuins.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is extraordinarily
beneficial for longevity.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And people say, oh, I sprinkled
a few blueberries on my salad,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.330 align:middle line:90%
isn't that fantastic?

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, yeah,
I bet salad tastes great

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and it looks very pretty,
unfortunately, it's

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:90%
not enough blueberries.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to eat about three
gallons of blueberries a day

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.085 align:middle line:90%
to have full beneficial effects.

00:10:16.085 --> 00:10:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> If you don't have
healthy lifestyle,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure these supplements
are going to help you that much.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
But second of all, pick
one thing or at most

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.260 align:middle line:84%
two things among these
supplements and try them.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And, ideally, you would
measure your biologic age

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
before and after you
try them as well.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:34.590 align:middle line:90%
So AKG goes down with age.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
It goes down in
animals and in humans.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And we found that if you restore
the AKG levels as you get older,

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
it has beneficial
effects on aging.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
So we're very
interested in trying

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to understand the mechanism
by which AKG acts.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.930 align:middle line:84%
But even more so, we want to
get more and more human data

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.170 align:middle line:84%
to show that maybe this is
the first natural product that

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.530 align:middle line:84%
can actually reverse
biological age in people.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.145 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing clinical
studies to try to test that.

00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:03.330 align:middle line:84%
>> When it comes to
longevity supplements,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
these are ingredients that
are being demonstrated

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.860 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory and in
clinical studies to be able

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
to slow down the pace of aging
or to be able to positively

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
impact the different
hallmarks of aging.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a short list,
but ingredients

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
like alpha-ketoglutarate,
fisetin, glycine,

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and so on have been found to
have these very positive effects

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:90%
on the aging process.

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:30.560 align:middle line:10%
And what's even
more exciting to me

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.590 align:middle line:10%
is the combination
of these ingredients.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of my absolute
favorite things in this category

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.580 align:middle line:90%
is astaxanthin.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:90%
Comes from algae.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:84%
When algae gets angry, meaning
physiologically stressed,

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.740 align:middle line:84%
it makes this lovely
pink orange goo.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And that is astaxanthin.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And it protects that cell
from physiologic stress,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:90%
especially oxidative stress.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And it protects us
from oxidative stress.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a database online
called the drug age database.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:10%
And this database has more than
2,000 studies cataloged for more

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:10%
than 1,000 molecules,
from pharmaceuticals

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:10%
to over-the-counter
natural ingredients,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:10%
across 37 different species
that show lifespan extending

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:10%
characteristics of
these ingredients.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
It's the most complete database
in existence for lifespan

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.305 align:middle line:90%
extending compounds.

00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:24.520 align:middle line:84%
>> As you get older, you have
micronutrient deficiencies,

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
so you need to make up
those micronutrients,

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:84%
which is why people
should take multivitamins.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.770 align:middle line:84%
However, an excessive
amount doesn't actually

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:90%
help with longevity.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
It just makes you
not as unhealthy

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.400 align:middle line:90%
as you could have been.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a fun hobby, to take
a lot of supplements a day.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.640 align:middle line:84%
So people who take 70 or
100 supplements a day,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I think they're having
fun with what they do.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that
we can say it's

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.280 align:middle line:90%
doing much good beyond that.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Yes, all of the mechanisms
exist, all of these interactions

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
are documented, these
supplements do something,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.365 align:middle line:84%
but that something is likely
too small to care about.

00:12:57.365 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Most supplements,
the vast majority,

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:90%
are not longevity supplements.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.700 align:middle line:10%
They might be for some
short-term health benefit,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.560 align:middle line:10%
maybe exercise performance
or focus, or improving libido

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:10%
or whatever it is that
people are looking for.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And many companies will claim
that their longevity supplements

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.118 align:middle line:84%
simply because they are good
for short-term health outcomes,

00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:17.535 align:middle line:84%
but that's not,
in fact, the case.

00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's lots of
interest, obviously,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.370 align:middle line:84%
in natural products that might
target the biological aging

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:84%
One of the big advantages
of natural products

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is you don't have to do an
FDA clinical trial, right.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:10%
So if they work,
it's much easier

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.750 align:middle line:10%
to get that to consumers
and to the general public.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
The downside is it doesn't
require FDA approval.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Meaning nobody has to
do a clinical trial.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.560 align:middle line:84%
If I had to place
a bet right now,

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
I would say alpha-ketoglutarate
looks interesting.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.640 align:middle line:84%
There is some reason to believe
that alpha ketoglutarate could

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.360 align:middle line:84%
potentially have
beneficial effects,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.815 align:middle line:84%
at least in some people,
in the context of aging.

00:13:52.815 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:10%
>> If you want to take something
with the full knowledge that it

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.320 align:middle line:10%
is experimental and we don't
know for some of these things

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:05.170 align:middle line:10%
even how safe they are, but it's
worth it to you because you have

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.110 align:middle line:10%
developed some major chronic
diseases and you're kind

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:10%
of at a stage where you'll
try anything, I think, again,

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.580 align:middle line:10%
as long as you're talking to
your doctor and you're taking

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.350 align:middle line:10%
things legally, I
think it's fine.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
But, again, just acknowledging
that we don't know

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
and really understanding
the science of where

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.702 align:middle line:90%
things are versus the hype.

00:14:26.702 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Vampires using other people's
blood to achieve immortality is

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the stuff of folk mythology, but
some scientists today believe

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.810 align:middle line:84%
that young blood could actually
help slow down the pace

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:90%
of aging.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.820 align:middle line:84%
The field of parabiosis,
or plasma exchange,

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.260 align:middle line:84%
is definitely a
controversial topic,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.715 align:middle line:84%
but it has many
people intrigued.

00:14:48.715 --> 00:14:52.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Parabiosis, which
is young blood,

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
this is also very important and
incredible advances have been

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:84%
done in the last
couple of years.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:84%
We are identifying what
is good in young blood

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and what is bad in old blood,
and we will soon discover really

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.870 align:middle line:84%
the key elements
to rejuvenate blood

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
because blood goes
throughout the body

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and it will allow the
body to stay younger.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, blood plasma is
something that is very scalable.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.822 align:middle line:84%
Blood transfusions happen all
around the world every day,

00:15:20.822 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and I think that
that's going to be

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.043 align:middle line:84%
a very important part of
having systemic rejuvenation.

00:15:25.043 --> 00:15:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And we see that these therapies
are really going to come through

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.065 align:middle line:90%
within the next five years.

00:15:29.065 --> 00:15:32.480 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a history of
literature showing that if you

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.650 align:middle line:84%
take blood from a young mouse
and give that to an old mouse--

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
this is often done surgically
through a process called

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.750 align:middle line:84%
parabiosis-- that that can
actually have beneficial effects

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.600 align:middle line:90%
on the old mouse.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, when you
connect the circulatory system

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.370 align:middle line:84%
of a young mouse
with an old mouse,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:84%
it has detrimental effects
on the young mouse.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, surgically attaching
a young person to an old person

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.070 align:middle line:84%
isn't going to fly,
so the alternative

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
would be transfusions, plasma
transfusions, for example.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's much
evidence yet in people

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.047 align:middle line:84%
that that has significant
beneficial effects

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:84%
but, again, it's pretty
early and only very,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.730 align:middle line:84%
very small uncontrolled
trials have been done.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:10%
But, again, I think from
a feasibility perspective,

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:10%
if we're trying to think
about an intervention that

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:10%
could be useful for hundreds
of millions of people, that's

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:10%
just not very pragmatic.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:10%
So I think that the direction
that many people are trying

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.850 align:middle line:10%
to go is to identify what
are the specific factors

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.073 align:middle line:10%
in the blood that are
accounting for these effects,

00:16:29.073 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:10%
and then you could do a
much more targeted approach.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I do hear a lot of people
talking about getting young

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:38.770 align:middle line:84%
people's plasma, and
certainly that can be done.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.330 align:middle line:84%
It's typically done in a
clinical trial setting where

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.970 align:middle line:84%
you get rid of your
old plasma and you

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:90%
get young plasma in return.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
From the data we have so far,
getting young people's plasma

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.260 align:middle line:84%
really didn't make
a big difference.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
It was simply the
process of getting

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.220 align:middle line:84%
rid of old plasma that really
made a difference from an aging

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.020 align:middle line:90%
standpoint.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have too many
inflammatory markers or toxins

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:84%
in your blood, it's going to
increase your propensity towards

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:07.450 align:middle line:90%
aging.

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.700 align:middle line:90%
Plasmapheresis helps us do that.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.690 align:middle line:10%
It removes some of these
toxins, inflammatory markers

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:10%
from your blood,
and we replenish it

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.620 align:middle line:10%
with healthy serum,
albumin, basically.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps we can
slow down aging,

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:26.235 align:middle line:84%
the disease of aging by
getting rid of our old plasma.

00:17:26.235 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Gene therapy sounds scary.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Altering a person's
genome could obviously

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.880 align:middle line:90%
have unforeseen consequences.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
But despite the
unknowns, there seemed

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:84%
to be exciting paths
for these technologies

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.415 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
longevity and aging.

00:17:40.415 --> 00:17:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I think CRISPR
is very exciting.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I think like anything,
it's like AI.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
It can also create
some challenges too.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just a blind
optimist, but if you

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:84%
look at human history,
electricity can light up a city

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.430 align:middle line:90%
or it can kill somebody.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:10%
So I think these
technologies have

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:10%
to be monitored but the
opportunity with CRISPR

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:10%
to, for example, have children
now that can see again

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.115 align:middle line:10%
that were blind, that's
actually happening as we speak.

00:18:07.115 --> 00:18:10.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We sequence the human
genome back 20 years ago,

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.600 align:middle line:90%
it used to cost $1 billion.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And take a year to
sequence a single genome,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
it's dropped from billions of
dollars to hundreds of dollars,

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.520 align:middle line:90%
and from a year to seven hours.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to sequence
every person's genome.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:84%
As a baby is born, their
genome will be sequenced

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and we'll understand what
are they likely to come down

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:34.520 align:middle line:90%
with as disease.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.675 align:middle line:90%
Can we solve it in advance?

00:18:36.675 --> 00:18:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> You, of course, can
optimize healthspan,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
you can slow your
speed of aging,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:84%
but if we want to prolong
life in any meaningful way,

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.710 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have to get gene
therapies working robustly.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:52.730 align:middle line:10%
>> As humans, really, we
can only live to 120, 122,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:10%
and really we need something
at a genetic level to be able

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.675 align:middle line:10%
to change that, to be
able to be living older.

00:18:57.675 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So we see that
gene therapies are

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:02.385 align:middle line:84%
going to be a very important
part of the longevity agenda.

00:19:02.385 --> 00:19:05.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Most people understand
that exercise is the best way

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:90%
to fight the aging process.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.430 align:middle line:10%
What if we could give
you an injection that

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:10%
can help to increase your bone
density, your lean body mass,

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle line:10%
it can extend your
lifespan by 30%

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.320 align:middle line:10%
and it can almost
trick your body

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.990 align:middle line:10%
into feeling like it's
exercising at a cellular level

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:10%
without you actually exercising?

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the promise of
the follistatin gene

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
therapy and other
gene therapies that

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:90%
are currently being developed.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's the world's first
reversible gene therapy,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:84%
which means that you
can take an antibiotic

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.903 align:middle line:84%
and you can get it out
of your body at any time.

00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
There's no other gene therapy in
the world that can be reversed.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Right now, as with any new
technology, it's expensive.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But Moore's law will apply,
which means the manufacturing

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:84%
process to make these gene
therapies will become better.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And as that process becomes
better, it becomes cheaper.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And so within 10 years,
I envision a future

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.650 align:middle line:84%
where this will be democratized
and accessible to everyone.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So I believe that we don't
need to be subjected to just

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:90%
the laws of evolution anymore.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.140 align:middle line:90%
We can control it.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.130 align:middle line:10%
And I think that even though
survival of the species

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.750 align:middle line:10%
is better if we
knock off the old,

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:10%
I think we can figure out a
way for the human species,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.030 align:middle line:10%
and our pets too,
to survive even

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:10%
without the old
being knocked off.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> In any industry, there are
scams and shady practices.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And in the health and longevity
space, it's no different.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:84%
So what can your
average person do

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
to help differentiate good
science from bad science,

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and promising therapies
from straight out scams?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody wants to
sell you something.

00:20:36.603 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And the people who don't want
to sell you things, they all

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.062 align:middle line:90%
have a different opinion.

00:20:40.062 --> 00:20:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So, ultimately,
you're going to have

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.730 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to read the
scientific literature

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and how to form your
own opinions based

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.900 align:middle line:90%
on that primary data.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We're trying to distinct
between anti-aging and between

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
zero therapeutics
or geroscience.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.930 align:middle line:10%
It's a major problem
because a lot

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:02.725 align:middle line:10%
of the people in the anti-aging
are charlatans knowingly.

00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:10%
In other words, they
tell you, take that

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.233 align:middle line:10%
and you'll live forever.

00:21:06.233 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And you take it and you
die, nobody sues them.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Or a they're not
really charlatans,

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
but they're thinking
that they have a promise.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
But they haven't shown that
this promise is working.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> If we can't find robust
evidence to support it,

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:90%
then we don't do it.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:10%
In the current culture
of health and wellness,

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.790 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot of
participation in things that

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.150 align:middle line:10%
don't have scientific evidence.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.710 align:middle line:90%
It may work, it may not.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:32.900 align:middle line:84%
We are a group that works on
scientific evidence and data.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the science of
longevity before five to 10

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.780 align:middle line:90%
years ago was garbage.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And whatever people
were talking about

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.610 align:middle line:90%
was probably not very accurate.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps well-intended,
but not very accurate.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.625 align:middle line:84%
And the population is
just sitting ducks.

00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
putting a really bad slant

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:84%
on longevity science because
that's just entrepreneurship.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:84%
That's people wanting to
make money from people

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:90%
that don't know anything.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So I think right now people have
to understand several things.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Number one, the science is real.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.650 align:middle line:84%
We're no longer these
crazy crackpot scientists

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.820 align:middle line:84%
thinking about a world
that's non-existent.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.850 align:middle line:84%
You can improve your health and
you can improve your longevity.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.053 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:22:11.053 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
That's a great question
because everyone

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.430 align:middle line:90%
has a different answer for it.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:84%
For real longevity and
cellular optimization and then

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.990 align:middle line:84%
reevaluating what
your cells do need

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.480 align:middle line:84%
rather than just throwing in
everything that you don't need.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> One thing that we can say
is that the promise of life

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.480 align:middle line:90%
extension is mostly a promise.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Is not yet possible
to deliver upon,

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.380 align:middle line:84%
may never be possible
to deliver upon,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and yet there are going to
be a lot of buying customers.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:10%
>> The field of anti-aging has
more quacks and charlatans than

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.270 align:middle line:10%
any field ever.

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:47.730 align:middle line:10%
People for thousands
of years have

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:10%
been touting cure aging
products that don't really work.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:84%
The bottom line is, even
in scientific peer reviewed

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
studies, you can find
support for anything

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.580 align:middle line:90%
you wish to be true.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people will
force some study

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:84%
to get published just so
they can market a product.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.390 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an interesting field
to work in because it really is

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
at that interface of really
rock solid, rigorous science.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.670 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of
that in the field.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And then at the other end
there's pure snake oil.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Talk to two scientists,
they will give you two totally

00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:23.140 align:middle line:84%
different answers about aging
and what to do about it.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.380 align:middle line:10%
Talk to two self-experimenters
and one of them

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:10%
will be trying to
sell you something,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.136 align:middle line:10%
and the other one won't know
what they're talking about.

00:23:32.136 --> 00:23:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> No matter where you're
from or what your beliefs are,

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.430 align:middle line:84%
we can all agree that life is a
gift that should be cherished.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.180 align:middle line:84%
The people working in longevity
and life extension fields

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
want to extend that
gift for humanity.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:10%
Whether they can achieve
it remains to be seen,

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.760 align:middle line:10%
but if they succeed, it would
bring a new horizon to humanity

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:10%
where diseases of aging
become a thing of the past.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:59.995 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, aging is just being
who you are regardless of what

00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:00.795 align:middle line:90%
the number is.

00:24:00.795 --> 00:24:04.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We're giving people more
years with the people they love.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.400 align:middle line:84%
We're giving them more years
to work and be productive.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.980 align:middle line:84%
We're giving them more
years to do what they love.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
So when we're investing in
longevity, what we're really

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.400 align:middle line:90%
doing is making society better.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I can't say what the future
of longevity science holds

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:22.070 align:middle line:84%
for us, but I think with all
the great minds working on it,

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.835 align:middle line:84%
it's going to probably
be pretty amazing.

00:24:23.835 --> 00:24:26.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So anti-aging to me
is not the end goal,

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:84%
it's what it represents, that
we as a species become more

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.400 align:middle line:90%
peaceful and compassionate.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.420 align:middle line:84%
And we can focus our
energies less on indulging

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:84%
in these meaningless,
self-destructive behaviors

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.500 align:middle line:84%
and more on this
wide-open frontier where

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.760 align:middle line:90%
we say yes to the future.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:46.060 align:middle line:90%
