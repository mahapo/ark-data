From compounds like metformin and rapamycin to the radical reclassification of aging as a disease, we uncover the emerging science of longevity and the new frontier of life extension.\n\nBut the future of aging isn’t limited to pharmaceuticals. It’s evolving toward cellular regeneration, naturally guided genetic renewal, and AI-powered therapies. Aging is no longer fate — it’s code. And those who learn to rewrite it may be the first to transcend it.\n","teaser":"What if aging isn't fixed… but a system ready to be upgraded?","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/292e1245-4835-4fb8-b5be-0b293412720c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/ec8c3e64-b124-4dee-b83f-1da5bb883e5f?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/ec8c3e64-b124-4dee-b83f-1da5bb883e5f?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/ec8c3e64-b124-4dee-b83f-1da5bb883e5f?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Edward Norton, Tony Robbins, Mark Cuban, Tony Hawk, Peter Diamandis, Bryan Johnson, Dr. Sandra Kaufmann, Jose Cordeiro, Aubrey De Grey, Liz Parish"},{"seriesId":237222,"seriesTitle":"Longevity Hackers","seriesPath":"series/longevity-hackers","seriesVoteDownCount":49,"seriesVoteUpCount":187,"coverartImage":null,"created":"2025-06-16","episode":2,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":null,"heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/7afa97c2-3634-41f4-b765-9782eef9e0e3?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/optimizing-lifestyle-based-solutions","previewImage":null,"published":true,"season":1,"title":"Optimizing Lifestyle-Based Solutions","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26629","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Alternative Health","weight":0},{"content_id":"119961","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"transformation/personal-development","name":"Personal Development","weight":0},{"content_id":"120466","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/longevity","name":"Aging / Longevity","weight":1},{"content_id":"207964","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/health-healing","name":"Health & Healing","weight":1},{"content_id":"26650","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/docuseries","name":"Docuseries","weight":0},{"content_id":"207734","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/1-health-healing-rc","name":"1 - Health & Healing RC","weight":0}],"voteDownCount":9,"voteUpCount":169,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":4,"seasonCount":1,"preview":null,"feature":{"duration":1629,"mediaId":231778,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":231778,"isFree":false},"id":237662,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Everyone wants the next miracle drug… but few want to master the fundamentals.\n\nIn part two, we strip longevity back to its roots, revealing how muscle mass, sleep quality, cardiovascular health, and emotional resilience are still the most potent life-extending tools we have.
