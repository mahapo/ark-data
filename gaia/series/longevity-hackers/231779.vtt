00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:18.204 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:22.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Not all cells are made equal.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.720 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
types of cells called

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.240 align:middle line:84%
stem cells that hold a
big promise in the world

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:90%
of longevity and anti-aging.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.110 align:middle line:90%
So what are those cells?

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.545 align:middle line:84%
And how can we
benefit from them?

00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:10%
>> So I've been getting stem
cells now for about three years.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.672 align:middle line:84%
I first got it for a chronic
injury I had in my knees.

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:84%
My knees were super sore
and I was building arthritis

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:90%
from the way I trained.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
I trained really heavy,
really hard, very consistently

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.798 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a big
toll on my body.

00:00:49.798 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And stem cells are something
that are great for bringing down

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.050 align:middle line:84%
inflammation, but
what I learned is

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
that they're also great for
modulating your immune system.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And I personally have
an autoimmune disease

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:84%
called IgA nephropathy,
and that started

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.710 align:middle line:84%
to affect my
bodybuilding career.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
My stress on my body, it was
really just taking a toll on me.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then, I haven't
had an autoimmune flare up,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:90%
I've been much healthier.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.152 align:middle line:10%
My kidney filtration levels
are much more in range now,

00:01:13.152 --> 00:01:14.610 align:middle line:10%
and all my health
markers have been

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.270 align:middle line:10%
kind of getting much
better over time,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.070 align:middle line:10%
along with all the other
stuff I've been doing.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure all the
stem cells have been

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:90%
a huge contributor of that.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>> All stem cells really do is
they help to repair or restore

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:90%
So they're the building blocks.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.010 align:middle line:84%
If something is
damaged, they can

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:84%
help to repair that damaged
tissue back into a normal state.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.660 align:middle line:10%
Now, stem cells also have a
unique ability to self divide,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.260 align:middle line:10%
meaning they can go through
this process called mitosis

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.880 align:middle line:10%
where they can divide
and regrow new tissue.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Aging is happening because
of these cellular processes.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.270 align:middle line:10%
What if we can take
these cellular processes

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.710 align:middle line:10%
and turn them back
into a normal state?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Meaning like you were
when you were 20.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The stem cells are that
regenerative engine that are

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:90%
constantly repairing.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
But as we age, the number
of cells in our body

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:84%
can be reduced by hundreds
to thousands of fold

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.200 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have
the cells there.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:84%
And the DNA that was resonant
and pristine at birth

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to
degrade as we age.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So one of the big
technology areas is,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.935 align:middle line:84%
can we replenish your
stem cell population?

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we can have a
treatment that can target all

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
the hallmarks of aging
in an effective way,

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
that to me is not only the
most effective in terms of time

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
saving, but it's also most
likely to be the most impactful.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So in my opinion,
intravenous treatments

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:84%
of stem cells and
exosomes, which

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:84%
are derived from
stem cells, target

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.895 align:middle line:84%
all those hallmarks of aging and
can slow it down significantly.

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
>> As long as it's
done properly,

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I also don't see too many
potential side effects so I

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
think the risk is very high,
but these are just opinions.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.320 align:middle line:84%
There's very little
hard scientific evidence

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
to make any sort of
a objective judgment.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> It's hard to say that
everyone should try stem cell

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.290 align:middle line:84%
therapy because there's plenty
of ways to be healthy very

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.180 align:middle line:84%
naturally without drugs,
without spending a lot of money.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.910 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's
specific people who

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.740 align:middle line:84%
have specific problems that
it can definitely help with.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Whether it be chronic
injuries, arthritis,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.450 align:middle line:84%
lots of inflammatory
diseases, autoimmune diseases,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.897 align:middle line:84%
I think they can
definitely help.

00:03:13.897 --> 00:03:15.980 align:middle line:84%
But I also believe there's
plenty of other methods

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:84%
to help if that's not
really in your price range

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.520 align:middle line:84%
to afford stem cells and
much more you can do.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely
something that I

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
would like to see
the cost come down

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.800 align:middle line:84%
and the availability to the
public become a lot more widely

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.595 align:middle line:84%
available to the public
so everybody can use it.

00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Like Hippocrates once said,
"Let food be thy medicine,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.610 align:middle line:90%
and let medicine be thy food."

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.695 align:middle line:84%
This old adage, it seems,
is still valid to this day.

00:03:41.695 --> 00:03:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you keto
or are you paleo?

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Are you pescatarian?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Or are you vegan or plant-based?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever it is.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:10%
You can be what you want, but
you got to eat healthy food.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.358 align:middle line:10%
You got to eat whole foods.

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:10%
And that means in
general, regardless

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.995 align:middle line:10%
of which one of
those things you are,

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:53.545 align:middle line:10%
you got to eat a lot of plants.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.378 align:middle line:84%
And you have to have some
high-quality protein.

00:03:56.378 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think diet is one of
the most cost-effective ways

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.640 align:middle line:90%
to increase your health.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.252 align:middle line:84%
So I really try and focus
on a whole food diet.

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of diet
fads that come out,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.300 align:middle line:84%
whether it be carnivore or
keto and all these things,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure they all
work in their own way

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.277 align:middle line:84%
but at the end of
the day, they're

00:04:11.277 --> 00:04:13.252 align:middle line:84%
all restrictions
that stop yourself

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
from putting certain
things in your body.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.388 align:middle line:84%
And I choose just to put
natural, whole foods in my body.

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Whatever's been around
the longest on this earth,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.805 align:middle line:84%
it's probably
there for a reason.

00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:22.220 align:middle line:10%
And it's not made by us.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.110 align:middle line:84%
It's made by the planet
Earth for us to eat.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's how I typically build
my diet, as natural as possible.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
>> If you switch to
mostly plant-based diet,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.930 align:middle line:84%
this can easily add two, three,
five healthy and happy years

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.730 align:middle line:90%
to your life.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm not religious about
being plant-based.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I occasionally eat
kind of meat or fish,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.790 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also very
focused to consume

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.955 align:middle line:90%
as much vegetables as possible.

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:55.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I do have a whole plant
diet, and at the end of the day,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
try and minimize my animal
proteins that I bring in.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I love being vegetarian.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
It can be weird when
you're with a bunch of guys

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:90%
going to a steakhouse.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
What I eat really
makes a difference

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.855 align:middle line:84%
in how everything
in my body operates.

00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Literally, I'm
plant-based, raw vegan.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.250 align:middle line:84%
As I get older, the
more raw foods I eat.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Mediterranean diet, rather,
is a great diet for people

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
to look at but today there's
technology where you can see

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.830 align:middle line:84%
what your body responds
most to in terms of food.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.290 align:middle line:10%
Some people burn carbs really
well, some people burn fat,

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.183 align:middle line:10%
some people burn proteins
so, again, that's

00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:10%
what we do at Fountain Life.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Find out what your individual
body needs and then design

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:90%
a diet around that ideally.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.803 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, and I think that's
the thing that doesn't get

00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:90%
enough attention.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.230 align:middle line:10%
You have to learn what it is
for you that fits your wiring.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
one size fits all.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Those type of life hacks
may not extend my lifespan,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
but they'll extend the
quality of my life.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> If there's one thing in
diet, it is eliminating sugar.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies never evolved for the
amount of sugar that we consume.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is a neuroinflammatory.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.050 align:middle line:10%
It's a cardiac inflammatory.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It is, unfortunately,
addicting and ravages the body

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.585 align:middle line:84%
in a multitude of
different ways.

00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:09.450 align:middle line:10%
>> When you get older, food
becomes more like medicine where

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.225 align:middle line:10%
you need the nutrients in order
to be able to be your best self.

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:10%
>> My opinion, and also
the scientific evidence,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:10%
shows that plant foods are the
sine qua non of a healthy diet.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
And so in our experience,
the sicker the patients are,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.655 align:middle line:84%
the more they have to rely
on 100% plant-based diet.

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's been a lot of
debate as to which diet is best,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:84%
but overwhelmingly it seems
that at the moment the best diet

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
or the best evidence for a diet
would be the Mediterranean diet.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
So this is things like lots
of fruits, vegetables, fish,

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:84%
olive oil, nuts, seeds,
those are the things that

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
seem to actually
improve our health

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.820 align:middle line:90%
and improve the aging process.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I eat a 95% plant-based diet.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
I eat a little bit of
fish and occasionally will

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit of
cheese or dairy in my diet.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So there's evidence from
both epidemiological,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
which is just looking at
different populations,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
and also some experimental data
showing that plant-based diet is

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:90%
what we would call anti-aging.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's associated with
slower rates of aging.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:10%
So from the epidemiological
perspective,

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:10%
you can look at these
longest lived populations

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:10%
around the world which live in
these areas called blue zones,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.230 align:middle line:10%
and they tend to be although
not exclusively plant-based,

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.225 align:middle line:10%
mostly plant-based.

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of whether specific
diet approaches to dietary

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.092 align:middle line:84%
components are
good or bad, look,

00:07:34.092 --> 00:07:35.800 align:middle line:84%
everybody's trying to
sell you something.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:10%
Vegetarians are
generally better off,

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:39.302 align:middle line:10%
but are they better
off because they're not

00:07:39.302 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:10%
eating all the gunk
that comes with meat

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:10%
or are they better off
just because vegetarians

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:10%
tend to eat fewer calories?

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Even a question
as simple as that,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:90%
nobody can tell you the answer.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So just basically eat sensibly
and keep the calories lower.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
>> The most practical things
that people can do, one,

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.800 align:middle line:84%
identify the worst
version of yourself.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And you know who that person is.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.310 align:middle line:90%
In me it was evening Brian.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:84%
5:00 PM to 10:00 PM he ate junk
food and way too much every

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:08.970 align:middle line:90%
single night.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't stop him.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
You have your own
version of evening Brian,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:90%
who is that person?

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.820 align:middle line:90%
When do they show up?

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.950 align:middle line:90%
What are their arguments?

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And what can you do to
develop a plan to stop them?

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So in my case, I fired
evening Brian and said,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
you cannot make
decisions anymore.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most useful
things you can do in your life

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is identify versions
of you that engage

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
in self-destructive
behavior that you

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
feel powerless to correct,
try to overpower that.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.260 align:middle line:10%
Name the person,
identify their behaviors,

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:10%
what their thought patterns
are, what their arguments are,

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.905 align:middle line:10%
and then systematically
eliminate them from your life.

00:08:43.905 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:10%
>> The purpose of health and
Longevity Tech Fund is to make

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.870 align:middle line:10%
the longevity solutions
massively affordable

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.350 align:middle line:10%
and available.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.790 align:middle line:84%
This is why we are building up
to 10,000 cafes around the world

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
where you can get the basic
evolution of your health.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And the cafe will
serve you in a way

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.740 align:middle line:84%
how to improve your health
on a systematic way.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of this supported
by advanced algorithms

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.652 align:middle line:90%
and diagnostics.

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:18.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Heat and cold therapies
have been around for ages,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.710 align:middle line:84%
but now scientists are
discovering the profound effects

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.160 align:middle line:84%
that these simple protocols
can have on our health.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:32.938 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.938 --> 00:09:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Wim, Wim Hof.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.160 align:middle line:84%
They call me the iceman because
I broke a lot of records

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.740 align:middle line:90%
in the extreme cold.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Cold exposure is the
training of the neglected

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:90%
cardiovascular system.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
It is the best cardiovascular
workout you can imagine.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
It is the training of 125,000
kilometers of blood vessels

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and millions of
little muscles inside.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:10%
It is tackling the
cardiovascular related diseases,

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.868 align:middle line:10%
killing millions of people in
Western societies every year.

00:10:14.868 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>> One of my favorite
things that I've been doing

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.320 align:middle line:84%
for the last five
years is ice baths.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:84%
So I have a cold
plunge in my backyard,

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
and I like to do these
away from working out

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
either early in the
morning or on a rest day

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.500 align:middle line:84%
because how strong the
anti-inflammatory benefits are,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.740 align:middle line:84%
it can actually
decrease the benefits

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.940 align:middle line:84%
of hypertrophy training,
such as lifting weights.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
You want the inflammation from
immediately after training,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.100 align:middle line:84%
so you don't want to get
an ice bath after that.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.058 align:middle line:84%
But applying it at
different parts of your day,

00:10:40.058 --> 00:10:42.840 align:middle line:84%
it can decrease your cortisol
levels, increase dopamine.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It can help reset
your HRV levels

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:84%
to help you sleep
better at night.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.533 align:middle line:84%
A lot of benefits that
come from cold therapy,

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of studies
have been on that lately.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So at a certain moment, I
came in contact with scientists.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:11:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And they tested me, experimented
me, and researched upon me.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And they found out that I was
able to bring down inflammation.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Inflammation causes 50
to 60 million people

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:84%
to die every year, and probably
a couple of billion people

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.510 align:middle line:84%
to have a less quality of
life because of inflammation.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
As long as cells are able
to reproduce and to divide,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.140 align:middle line:90%
you live longer.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.550 align:middle line:84%
You can influence that
process very directly

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.000 align:middle line:84%
by going into cold
showers every day,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
because then you train
the cardiovascular system.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And then the oxygen,
nutrients, the vitamins,

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.500 align:middle line:84%
they get everywhere
in all the cells.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:84%
A cold shower a day
keeps the doctor away,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:90%
that's what I always say.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And now even the
doctors are doing it

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.675 align:middle line:84%
because they know
the shit works.

00:11:47.675 --> 00:11:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a great fan
of cold plunges.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I have started this practice
like four years ago,

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and I have observed a
tremendous difference.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:84%
So I have suffered from
frequent colds years

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:84%
ago until I changed to cold
showers, which I do every day.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And this has actually
increased my resilience

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.002 align:middle line:84%
against infectious diseases
quite tremendously.

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Ancient cultures were drawn
to saunas not because they

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.780 align:middle line:84%
thought they would live longer,
they were drawn because it made

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:90%
them feel better.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.010 align:middle line:84%
Similar to today, it could
be 70 degrees outside

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.730 align:middle line:84%
and you feel the
warmth of the sun.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.255 align:middle line:84%
It just feels
really, really good.

00:12:29.255 --> 00:12:32.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Heat exposure for longevity
is a really interesting area

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.460 align:middle line:90%
of research.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of data
coming out from Finland where

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:90%
they were looking at sauna use.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that
the combination

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
of sauna use with
exercise seemed

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:84%
to protect against heart disease
even more than just exercise

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.200 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:84%
By going into saunas
and subjecting yourself

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to quite high temperatures,
we elevate the heart rate,

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and we start to sweat
out different salts.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that, we're
activating heat shock proteins.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's hoped that by activating
those types of proteins,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
we can make ourselves
more resilient.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.125 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, we can protect
ourselves from heart disease.

00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The good news is you can
activate these powerful heat

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:84%
shock proteins through
any type of heat activity.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Could be a hot bath, it could
be hot water with lemon,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.400 align:middle line:90%
it can be a sauna.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.395 align:middle line:84%
It can be anything
that generates heat.

00:13:19.395 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I also have a sauna, which
sometimes I contrast therapy.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.130 align:middle line:84%
I go back and forth
from sauna to cold tub.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And within that I'll
wear a heart rate monitor

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and I'll let my heart
rate get really high

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.100 align:middle line:84%
in the sauna, whether
doing sit ups or push ups.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll immediately
go over to the cold tub

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and maybe do some
breathwork like that.

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'll
see my heart rate

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
go from 150 beats per minute
to 50 beats per minute

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
in the matter of
like two minutes,

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
and that is a system that
I do that allows my body

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.947 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to stress a
lot more effectively.

00:13:45.947 --> 00:13:48.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Believe it or not, one of the
most powerful things research

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
has shown that will transform
your health is a sauna, a sauna,

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:90%
20 minutes at over 162 degrees.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.678 align:middle line:84%
And the best saunas
are those infrared,

00:13:56.678 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
so you have to get one
that goes that high.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But the research on
that is unmistakable.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
55% less chance of
having a heart attack.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.197 align:middle line:10%
52% less chance of
having a stroke.

00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:08.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it goes on and on.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.630 align:middle line:90%
The goal is five times a week.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.820 align:middle line:84%
The study shows if you
do it three times a week

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.908 align:middle line:84%
at 20 minutes, at
162 degrees higher,

00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:16.950 align:middle line:84%
you get all the benefits
I just described to you,

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:17.970 align:middle line:90%
but to me it's just a habit.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.510 align:middle line:90%
I just do it.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:90%
It's fantastic.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Sir William Herschel
discovered infrared

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:90%
in the 1800s.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:10%
It was the first
major discovery,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.610 align:middle line:10%
and really brought
infrared to being known.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So much has changed
since that occurred.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Today, infrared is
used in hospitals.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Newborn babies are put in
incubators with infrared lamps

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.020 align:middle line:90%
to emulate the mother's womb.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.110 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Harry Whalen
worked with NASA.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
What we realized is
if you had a wound,

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.480 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't heal the same in
space as it does on Earth.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
So he used LEDs to
increase cellular growth

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.550 align:middle line:90%
to improve wound healing.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.070 align:middle line:84%
This was then later
used by the US military,

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.340 align:middle line:90%
in particular Navy SEALs.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Extreme heat exposure is
also really important to me.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:06.080 align:middle line:84%
Once I learned that when you
do saunas five to seven times

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:84%
a week, you're reducing all
cause mortality up to 50%,

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.398 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just doing
it myself, I'm like,

00:15:11.398 --> 00:15:12.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking my mom
to do it every day.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.430 align:middle line:84%
>> We have numerous studies
showing the benefit of combining

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:21.360 align:middle line:84%
both light and heat to
make the brain healthier.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.020 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways the
brain becomes healthier

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.290 align:middle line:84%
as a result of combining
infrared light and heat

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.620 align:middle line:84%
is by increasing the
blood flow to the brain

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and helping to
recharge the brain

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.810 align:middle line:84%
cells so that the brain can
think clearer and respond

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:90%
faster.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.690 align:middle line:10%
Some of the
conditions at infrared

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.850 align:middle line:10%
has been shown to
improve are depression,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.430 align:middle line:10%
Alzheimer's and dementia.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.360 align:middle line:84%
There is recently a
study with depression

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that's extremely impressive
because with only one

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
treatment of infrared, people
reduced their depression

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:90%
symptoms for over six weeks.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
>> A sauna practice affects
the core body temperature.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.435 align:middle line:84%
Viruses cannot live in a altered
feverish, poor body temperature.

00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There are numerous studies,
some I will highlight,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.470 align:middle line:90%
are the BUS study.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.760 align:middle line:84%
That stands for
blood, urine, sweat.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:10%
This study showed the difference
of heavy metals being removed

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:24.450 align:middle line:10%
from the body with infrared
treatment through sweat,

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.630 align:middle line:10%
versus blood and urine.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, one
of the results was

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:34.270 align:middle line:84%
when people tested for mercury,
15% had no levels of mercury.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.405 align:middle line:84%
But then when they tested their
sweat, it was 100% had mercury.

00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Infrared saunas increased the
promotion of white blood cells,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
which help to build
your immunity.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:10%
Infrared saunas increase
sweat, which helps

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:50.310 align:middle line:10%
you get rid of the toxins.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:10%
As your body's sweating, it's
fighting to cool itself down.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:10%
That increases
their circulation,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.470 align:middle line:10%
which also helps to
push the immune cells

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:01.470 align:middle line:10%
throughout your body, getting
them to where they need to be.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And, finally, using
an infrared sauna.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Relaxation, it's everything.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Getting ourselves out
of this chronic stress,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
this fight or flight
mentality truly

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.251 align:middle line:84%
is one of the best factors to
increasing our immune system

00:17:15.251 --> 00:17:16.459 align:middle line:90%
and helping to fight disease.

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Go into the sauna.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.400 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.904 align:middle line:90%
I love the sauna.

00:17:25.904 --> 00:17:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So what if the breakthroughs
in longevity do not become

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
a reality as quickly as
we would like them to?

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.818 align:middle line:84%
If we're running out of
time, is there a plan B?

00:17:37.818 --> 00:17:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Personally, I also
believe in cryonics.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.690 align:middle line:84%
If someone dies,
we can cryonically

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:84%
suspend them and
keep them frozen,

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:51.350 align:middle line:84%
if you will, for maybe 50 years,
until we can reanimate them.

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So I think this
is a possibility.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.590 align:middle line:84%
This was also impossible
before, until it

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.040 align:middle line:84%
was discovered with in
vitro fertilization, which

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is freezing embryos or
human eggs or human sperm.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
this is possible.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are 8 million humans
who have been already frozen

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:90%
when they were embryos.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:16.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in the 1970s, we
really were freezing people.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have any
technology that would

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:90%
allow us to do anything else.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And as most people know,
when you freeze tissue,

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:84%
you get crystallization, you
get dehydration of the cells,

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.100 align:middle line:90%
a lot of different problems.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 47 years,
we've come a long way

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.510 align:middle line:90%
in what we're able to do.

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:41.360 align:middle line:84%
The biggest breakthrough
was about 15 years ago

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
when we learned how
to vitrify tissue.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
Vitrification is a
physics term which

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.990 align:middle line:84%
refers to taking a liquid
below the ice point

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:56.210 align:middle line:84%
and not having it
crystallize, but have it

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:90%
turn into a glass-like state.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, there's
a lot less damage.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:10%
Once we were able to do that,
it was huge leaps forward,

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:10%
but we still had the
problem of rewarming.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Those of us who
are more optimistic

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
think it will be
50 years or less,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and those who are
more pessimistic

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.970 align:middle line:90%
put it at about 100 years.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:24.260 align:middle line:84%
With nanotechnology, the way
it's envisioned for revival

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
is it would do very much
the same kind of thing.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But instead of trillions
of biological cells,

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
you would have these tiny
little nanorobots which

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.170 align:middle line:84%
are computer controlled,
would be in the cells

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and they would do
the same thing.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:84%
They would look at a cell
wall that's been damaged,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.670 align:middle line:84%
tear it down into its
constituent atoms,

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.300 align:middle line:84%
and then rebuild the wall so
that it functions properly.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.510 align:middle line:90%
Memory is cryopreserved.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't have our memories,
it's not going to be us.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:10%
And so that's integral.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
And we feel very confident
that memory and identity

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.622 align:middle line:90%
are being retained.

00:20:01.622 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you stop
and think about it,

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.680 align:middle line:84%
not a single human
being has ever survived

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.930 align:middle line:90%
being alive on this Earth.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] There are
about 167 people

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to make that
not be true for them right now.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Very soon, within
50 to 100 years,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
people will suddenly
realize that death

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:24.985 align:middle line:90%
was a thing of the past.

00:20:24.985 --> 00:20:28.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, if you're on the
Titanic and someone throws you

00:20:28.725 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:84%
a life vest, even if you're not
sure whether the life vest will

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.705 align:middle line:84%
do anything later, will you
jump for it or won't you?

00:20:33.705 --> 00:20:36.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think anybody who doesn't
do that and they can afford it

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:90%
is crazy.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.000 align:middle line:84%
That's something that
is the last resort.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.203 align:middle line:10%
But I sure hope I have
the money to afford it

00:20:42.203 --> 00:20:43.620 align:middle line:10%
if all of a sudden
I get diagnosed

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.270 align:middle line:10%
with some life
threatening disease,

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:10%
that I'm ready to be
frozen so that maybe 200

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:10%
years from now somebody can
cure me and bring me back.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I think that's better
than not trying.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I love coming in here.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.610 align:middle line:90%
It is a place of hope.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy to know that my family
members have a chance, as I hope

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.416 align:middle line:90%
I will, in seeing the future.

00:21:08.416 --> 00:21:12.840 align:middle line:84%
>> After creating the XPRIZE
Foundation and spearheading

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:84%
the development of the
private space industry sector,

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.160 align:middle line:84%
Peter Diamandis took on a new
challenge, stopping aging.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.410 align:middle line:84%
His new longevity XPRIZE
promises to pay $100 million

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.520 align:middle line:84%
to the team of
scientists that is

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:84%
able to come up with
solutions to halt aging

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:90%
within the next few years.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was in medical school,
I remember seeing a documentary

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.130 align:middle line:90%
on long lived sea life.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:10%
That certain species of
whales, bowhead whales,

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.870 align:middle line:10%
could live 200 years
and Greenland sharks

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.860 align:middle line:10%
could live four or 500 years.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:10%
And I remember thinking,
if they can live that long,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.430 align:middle line:10%
why can't we?

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And back then, the answer
that came to me was it's

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
either going to be a software
problem or a hardware problem,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
able to solve that.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I became enamored
over the last decade

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.970 align:middle line:84%
with building businesses
that could extend

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.933 align:middle line:90%
the healthy human lifespan.

00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:07.600 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of
the biggest business

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.760 align:middle line:84%
opportunities on the planet
and the greatest gift

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:90%
you can give anybody.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Age reversal XPRIZE is a
global technological competition

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that we want to run for develop
in solution to reverse aging.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.260 align:middle line:90%
So how are you going to do it?

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.100 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be 200, 300, 400
teams all around the world.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:84%
They should use their own
intervention technology or piece

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
of science to reverse aging, in
particular statistical sample

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.810 align:middle line:90%
of population.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:84%
The XPRIZE Foundation puts up
large scale global competitions,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.610 align:middle line:84%
and we ask the
world's entrepreneurs

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.830 align:middle line:84%
to solve a problem that
has not been solved.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.993 align:middle line:84%
And these competitions have a
very clear, objective outcome.

00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And they say, I don't care
where you went to school,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.360 align:middle line:90%
what you've ever done.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:90%
If you do this, you win.

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Our first XPRIZE was
for private spaceflight.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.370 align:middle line:84%
It was a $10 million
prize for the team that

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:84%
could build a private
spaceship, carry three adults up

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.300 align:middle line:84%
100 kilometers, land again and
do it again within two weeks.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:10%
And we're offering
$101 million purse

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:16.550 align:middle line:10%
for the team that can
reverse the ravages of aging.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:10%
Can you, in fact,
reverse by 20 years?

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Functionally, skin, immune,
muscle and cognition.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it's about
changing the mindset of people

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
from not, wow, this is crazy.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.840 align:middle line:90%
Can it be done?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.772 align:middle line:84%
To, oh my god, when is
it going to be done?

00:23:36.772 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Longevity is a new
field for science,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:90%
technology and medicine.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
There are many
questions out there

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:47.805 align:middle line:84%
and several misconceptions
about the space.

00:23:47.805 --> 00:23:51.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you start to talk to
somebody about extending human

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
lifespan, one of the first
places they go to is what about

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:90%
overpopulation?

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.160 align:middle line:10%
But there's a couple of
really relieving data points

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.210 align:middle line:10%
that need to be
discussed in that.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
The first one is
that all technology

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.050 align:middle line:90%
is working in parallel.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not that all scientists
are working on extending aging.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Some people are working
on global climate change,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
some people are working on how
to feed a multitude of people.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people are
working on space travel

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and how to start
mining asteroids.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.720 align:middle line:84%
But there is another data
point that's really important,

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.090 align:middle line:84%
and that is as lifespan
extends, birth rates go down.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's everywhere
in the world.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Overpopulation is
not a problem anymore.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.660 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this was a problem
that we saw like 20 years ago,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.770 align:middle line:10%
but today we know the growth
rate of the population

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.796 align:middle line:10%
is declining.

00:24:40.796 --> 00:24:44.810 align:middle line:10%
>> If we stop aging,
actually, we will save money

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:10%
because people will not go
to hospital for expensive

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:10%
treatments when they are dying
because people will not be

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:52.050 align:middle line:10%
dying.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So, actually, we
will have more money.

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:10%
The governments
will have more money

00:24:55.970 --> 00:25:00.260 align:middle line:10%
if people are young, if people
don't age, if people don't need

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.980 align:middle line:10%
expensive medical treatments,
if there is no retirement

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.980 align:middle line:10%
funds because people will
be young and able to work

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.396 align:middle line:10%
indefinitely if they want
in an economy of abundance.

00:25:10.396 --> 00:25:15.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And, indeed, a recent poll
suggests that 68% of Americans

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.260 align:middle line:84%
would support the treatment
of aging if the therapies were

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:84%
safe, effective, affordable,
and available to all.
