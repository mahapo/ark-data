00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:47.360 align:middle line:84%
>> For millennia, people
have dreamed of immortality.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.660 align:middle line:84%
From ancient shamans to the
great pharaohs of Egypt,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:84%
to more recent alchemists
and biohackers,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.900 align:middle line:84%
people have been trying to
cheat death for a while.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
But so far, no
one has succeeded.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:10%
Despite these
shortcomings, it seems

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:10%
we are living in quite
interesting times, where

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.750 align:middle line:10%
we could be near some
extraordinary scientific

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:10%
advances that could catapult
human lifespan to unheard

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:10%
of new levels.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.880 align:middle line:10%
Join us in this journey to
explore the latest breakthroughs

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:10%
in the science of longevity and
discover what we can do today

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:10%
to increase our chances of
living long enough to take

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.360 align:middle line:10%
advantage of the exciting
longevity technologies

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:10%
of the near future.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about
you, but most of us

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.030 align:middle line:84%
don't like the idea
of getting old.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
Just when things start
becoming interesting in life

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and we gain wisdom,
maturity, and stability,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.050 align:middle line:84%
our bodies and minds begin
to decline and slow down.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Some people even dare
to call aging a disease.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
>> People ask, is aging the
biggest risk factor of disease?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.210 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, it doesn't
matter, in my opinion.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
What matters is what science is
proving, pointed out that you

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.220 align:middle line:84%
have a five times greater chance
of dying of cancer if you smoke,

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
you have a 500 times
greater chance as you age.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:90%
Aging is the breakdown.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.350 align:middle line:84%
If we eliminated cancer, our
life expectancy as a country

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:84%
or as an individual would go
up about 3 and 1/2 to 5 years

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.830 align:middle line:90%
on which statistic you believe.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But aging plays a much
larger role in that process.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.042 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, people
at younger ages

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
are aging faster today
because they don't

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.833 align:middle line:90%
take care of their bodies.

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:20.950 align:middle line:84%
So there's zero question
that aging has a giant impact

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.185 align:middle line:90%
on the breakdown of disease.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:25.840 align:middle line:84%
>> 90% of the people in
developed countries die

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
because of aging, not
because of terrorism,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.860 align:middle line:90%
not because of climate change.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.230 align:middle line:84%
The enemy of humanity
today is aging.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Aging is basically
a loss of function.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.803 align:middle line:84%
So your kidneys, when you're
young, they perform fully

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to clear all
the toxins out of your body.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.980 align:middle line:84%
But after decades
of functioning,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:90%
they start to lose function.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
The same with the brain,
the same with the liver,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.630 align:middle line:90%
the same with the immune system.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.740 align:middle line:84%
Older people are more
susceptible to diseases

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there's
an accumulation of cells

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.675 align:middle line:84%
within a tissue that are no
longer functioning as originally

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:00.475 align:middle line:90%
intended.

00:03:00.475 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
>> People over the age of
65 usually have two or more

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
diagnoses of an aging disease,
because they go hand in hand.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
They are merely the symptom
of biological aging.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.910 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
definition of a pathology,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
aging fits a
pathology perfectly.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.630 align:middle line:84%
>> If people say aging
is not a disease, well,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.515 align:middle line:90%
it was not a disease.

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:24.140 align:middle line:10%
Why are there some animals that
don't have any detectable aging

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:10%
process, like lobsters
and tortoises and clams,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:10%
they have no detectable
aging at all.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about a three-fold
increased risk if you have high

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:84%
cholesterol for getting
cardiovascular disease.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you
know in your 20s that have

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.120 align:middle line:90%
cardiovascular disease?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:90%
Almost none.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.620 align:middle line:10%
And then it's extremely common,
by the time you get to your 70s,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.120 align:middle line:10%
it's like 100-fold risk.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:10%
It's obvious.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:10%
We've known this
for a long time.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.270 align:middle line:10%
If you slow aging, you delay
all of these chronic diseases.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.010 align:middle line:90%
So it's clearly a risk factor.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.922 align:middle line:84%
The biggest risk factor and
the most common risk factor.

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And that means we should be
spending the most effort trying

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:90%
to do something about it.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm definitely not
in favor of aging.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I think that aging is
the world's number one

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
problem because it causes
so much deprivation, so

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.220 align:middle line:90%
much suffering.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it kills
people, but it tends

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.530 align:middle line:84%
to kill people after a
long period of decline

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.545 align:middle line:84%
and decrepitude and
dependence and general misery.

00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:17.345 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:04:17.345 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Humans, we want to stay
active, young, creative.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And for that, we need
longevity extension.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
We need a healthy condition,
both of the body and the mind.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.190 align:middle line:90%
So I think it is an asset.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And there is nothing wrong
with wanting to be young.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It will be very important
step when regulators like FDA

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
will recognize
aging as a disease.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So this will allow
public funding or health

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.396 align:middle line:84%
insurance to finance these
longevity interventions.

00:04:48.396 --> 00:04:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What's exciting is when you
look at aging as a disease,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.800 align:middle line:84%
does anyone know
you can cure it?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.895 align:middle line:84%
And if you can cure it, this
disease, then you basically

00:04:57.895 --> 00:04:58.695 align:middle line:90%
can live forever.

00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Once we've gotten rid of the
degenerative process of aging,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.535 align:middle line:10%
then most diseases
will be eliminated.

00:05:08.535 --> 00:05:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So when people think about
aging in their own lifespan,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:84%
they frequently turn to their
parents and their grandparents

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to determine how long
they are going to live.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:10%
But it turns out, at
least science has recently

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:10%
told us, that only
7% of your lifespan

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.700 align:middle line:10%
can be based upon your genetics.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.010 align:middle line:84%
So conversely, 93% of your
health span is on you.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be what
you do with your life.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be what
you eat, if you exercise,

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:84%
what things you
surround yourself by.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.180 align:middle line:84%
>> We did a bad deal
with the devil one day.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.830 align:middle line:84%
We came to the
devil and said, why

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.070 align:middle line:84%
is life expectancy for thousands
of years, 25 to 35 years?

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.240 align:middle line:90%
That's the life expectancy.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.375 align:middle line:90%
And the devil said, oh, oh, OK.

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.140 align:middle line:90%
I'll help you.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:90%
So he did.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
He gave us the sewer
and the clean water,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and antibiotics, and
vaccinations, and surgery.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
We went through this phase, and
now we have those diseases--

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's, and heart disease,
and cancer, and diabetes.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And we need to make
another deal now.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And the deal has to be
that we target aging.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:84%
By targeting aging, we're
going to prevent those diseases

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and make our health
span better again.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>> A common, inexpensive
diabetes drug has been making

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
headlines in the last few years
as a potential longevity drug.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.360 align:middle line:90%
But what is it?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.082 align:middle line:90%
And what's all the fuss about?

00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So metformin was a drug or
some of its cousins were drugs

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:90%
that were used 80 years ago.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And they were actually used
to prevent flu, and malaria,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:90%
and inflammation.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's during this
time that people

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
noted that those with diabetes,
it lowered their glucose level.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it became
a diabetic drug.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And we have preliminary data
to show you from other studies

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.340 align:middle line:84%
that people on metformin
have less diabetes,

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:84%
they have less heart disease,
they have less cancer.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.400 align:middle line:84%
They live longer even than
people without diabetes,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.540 align:middle line:90%
less Alzheimer's.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And because of its safety
record and because it's generic,

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:84%
it's the cheapest drug on
the market, we thought,

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:90%
that's a great entry.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Health care providers
are not going

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:84%
to object that
their subjects will

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.500 align:middle line:84%
be on metformin, such
a cheap drug that will

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.370 align:middle line:90%
have so much health benefits.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And when we prove the concept,
the pharmaceuticals will jump in

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and the world will rapidly
become a better place.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm much more
conservative here,

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.460 align:middle line:84%
so I would love to see
the outcome of TAME trial.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a 5,000 people trial
where metformin is going to be

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.990 align:middle line:84%
used to measure its
reversal effect.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So I do believe that
in five years from now

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.030 align:middle line:84%
metformin can be
the first or one

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.370 align:middle line:90%
of the first longevity drugs.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So metformin is
going to be a start.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
It will give us two or three
years, which is enough time

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.880 align:middle line:84%
to then maybe add another
drug or another drug

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.830 align:middle line:84%
or being more dramatic
in how we attack aging.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Two or three years
is a concept that I

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:90%
want to put in perspective.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.170 align:middle line:84%
If we cured heart disease
in the United States now,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:84%
we'll get two or three
years of life extension.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
So two or three years
of health span is a lot,

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's translated to
trillions and trillions

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:90%
of dollars of saving.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying two or three
years on average, right?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people may be metformin
won't be effective,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:84%
and some people may live
10 years healthier or more.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, everyone can
do whatever they'd like,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:84%
and there's different evidence
for different molecules.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, there's
very good evidence

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
for metformin in animal models
that it slows down aging.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
initial evidence

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.627 align:middle line:84%
in humans, although in some
humans have side effects.

00:09:05.627 --> 00:09:06.835 align:middle line:90%
And so you don't really know.

00:09:06.835 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>> We know everything we need to
know in metformin because there

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
are billions of years of use
of metformin across the world.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:10%
There's not going
to be any surprise.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.880 align:middle line:84%
When you start metformin,
a lot of people

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:84%
have side effects in
the first week of use,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually
gastrointestinal side effects.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Other than that,
most people have

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
no idea that they are
taking any drug like that.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would claim
that it has the best

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:90%
record of any drug for safety.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It does amazing things for
you in terms of longevity,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
changes your gut microbiota,
activates your AMP kinase,

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.300 align:middle line:84%
does just a myriad
of amazing things.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.430 align:middle line:84%
The same time, it's a
partial mTOR inhibitor.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:90%
That's a problem.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.750 align:middle line:84%
It also uncouples
your mitochondria

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to a certain degree, so you have
less energy efficiency, which

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.430 align:middle line:90%
means it helps you lose weight.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
if you're an athlete,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.410 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to
have as much energy.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's all of these caveats
and innuendos of these things

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be aware
of as we start playing

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.215 align:middle line:90%
with the aspects of longevity.

00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:14.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So metformin's, actually
probably the worst of the--

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure it's not the worst.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It's the worst of the
popular approaches

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:90%
to stress response upregulation.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
why it's popular.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.990 align:middle line:84%
This thing just has such mixed
results in animal studies.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Yet you have this human
study in diabetic patients,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.140 align:middle line:84%
where the diabetic
patients gained

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
a small but very consistent
gain in life expectancy

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:90%
just a few years.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just not interesting.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.665 align:middle line:84%
If you told them to go exercise,
it would have been way better.

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that for
type 2 diabetics,

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.150 align:middle line:90%
metformin is fantastic for them.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It reduces their heart disease
risk and kidney disease

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:90%
progression.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
for non-diabetics

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.990 align:middle line:84%
when they take metformin,
there was a 2019 TAME study

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that showed that those
who took metformin,

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.310 align:middle line:84%
they actually impaired
their response to exercise.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So those that were
taking metformin,

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.960 align:middle line:84%
they were only
receiving about 50%

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.090 align:middle line:84%
of the benefit of the exercise
regime that they were doing.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So we need to make sure that
with any strategy that we're

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
doing, it's first of all
safe and then effective.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Nir Barzilai is running
the same trial that will help

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.460 align:middle line:90%
to give us a better answer.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think, there's no reason
to push ahead of the science

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
and start taking
these things before we

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.476 align:middle line:84%
have proof on whether they
have any impact on aging.

00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Taking a drug used by
organ transplant patients

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
and for cancer treatment as an
anti-aging therapy may sound

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.220 align:middle line:90%
a little outrageous.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.070 align:middle line:84%
But increased interest
in this approach

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.745 align:middle line:84%
is being driven by the
research into rapamycin.

00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So rapamycin is
a small molecule.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.960 align:middle line:84%
It's actually got a really
interesting backstory to it.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So it was first found
from bacterial cultures

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.380 align:middle line:84%
on Easter Island, which is, of
course, also called Rapa Nui.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
That's where the drug
gets its name from.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And what we've learned
over the past few decades

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:05.330 align:middle line:84%
is that this drug, in addition
to having interesting properties

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
in terms of affecting
the immune system,

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.980 align:middle line:84%
also seems to slow
the biological aging

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:84%
process in every animal
where it's been studied.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.760 align:middle line:84%
What we know at this point is
that if you treat laboratory

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
animals with rapamycin, you
see an increase in lifespan

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and a corresponding increase in
what we call health span, which

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:84%
is the period of life
that's spent in good health,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:84%
free from the chronic
diseases of aging.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So really, the big
question at this point

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
is whether or not
the same effects

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:84%
will be seen in dogs
or in people outside

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.510 align:middle line:90%
of the laboratory.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Over and over again
when rapamycin is tested,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.800 align:middle line:84%
we can see a roughly 15% to
20% lifespan extension in mice.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So out of all of the
molecules that we're currently

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
investigating to see what
molecules will actually

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.243 align:middle line:84%
extend lifespan, I'm most
excited about rapamycin.

00:12:53.243 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
high time that we

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.055 align:middle line:84%
translate some of that mice
data into human clinical trials.

00:12:58.055 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:84%
>> If you ask a clinician,
they're often worried about

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:90%
rapamycin.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is that it's
used for immune suppression.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
So after organ transplant,
for instance, people

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
are prescribed rapamycin, but
they're not prescribed rapamycin

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:90%
alone.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
They're given rapamycin
plus cyclosporine,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
which is a very strong
immune suppressant.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And together they further
suppress the immune system.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And so people are worried
about infections and things

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.520 align:middle line:84%
like that if they
take rapamycin.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.820 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is, in
a healthy population

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.610 align:middle line:84%
at a low dose of
rapamycin, it doesn't

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:90%
suppress the immune system.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
It's immunomodulatory,
in fact, it

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.715 align:middle line:84%
protects against some
respiratory infections.

00:13:34.715 --> 00:13:37.300 align:middle line:84%
>> The nice and good
thing about rapamycin,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.620 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the studies,
it's dose dependent,

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:84%
which means the more you give
or you're the more you take,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:90%
the better it works.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.290 align:middle line:84%
The problem is with rapamycin,
once you get to a high dose,

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:49.220 align:middle line:90%
you get side effects.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're trying
to eliminate these.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So in order to get those very
beneficial effects in mice

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.090 align:middle line:84%
that you see, we believe
it's important to have

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:00.805 align:middle line:84%
a drug that you can dose higher
without getting those side

00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:01.605 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:14:01.605 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Rapamycin seems
to be very promising.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.690 align:middle line:84%
We're actually using these
in some clinical trials,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.645 align:middle line:90%
and the effects are really good.

00:14:09.645 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So the Dog Aging Project is a
large scale study of the biology

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
of aging in companion
dogs or pet dogs,

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
is a clinical trial to try
to determine whether or not

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
rapamycin can have a positive
impact on the aging process

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:90%
in pet dogs.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:30.590 align:middle line:10%
So the one thing I can tell you
is that in both clinical trials,

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.320 align:middle line:10%
we saw no evidence for
significant side effects.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.170 align:middle line:10%
In the first clinical
trial, we also

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:10%
saw evidence for a restoration
of age related heart function.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
So just like in people, in pet
dogs as the dogs get older,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
there's a gradual decline
in heart function.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And we saw evidence that
rapamycin could partially

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:90%
reverse that.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:84%
That's also been seen
in laboratory mice.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.790 align:middle line:84%
And then in both studies,
we saw some evidence

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:90%
that the dogs were more active.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
appreciate that these

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:90%
were double blind trials.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Meaning that the owners
and the veterinarians,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:84%
neither group knew which
dogs were getting rapamycin

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:90%
or which were getting placebo.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, I cannot make any
recommendations about what you

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But I will say I know
a number of people

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.367 align:middle line:84%
who have consulted with their
private practice veterinarian

00:15:15.367 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:84%
and have convinced their
veterinarian to prescribe

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:18.990 align:middle line:90%
rapamycin for their dog.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.930 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of people I know are
taking rapamycin off label.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't encourage that.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I think more research
is probably a good idea,

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.155 align:middle line:90%
but people do it.

00:15:27.155 --> 00:15:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, there are certain
medications we take

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.233 align:middle line:84%
at Blueprint, which are
really on the cutting edge

00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:84%
of anti-aging science,
metformin and rapamycin are two.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of disagreements
in the scientific field

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.743 align:middle line:84%
about where these drugs are, and
what their proven efficacy is.

00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:41.910 align:middle line:84%
We believe there's sufficient
data to incorporate it

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:90%
as an experimental.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.230 align:middle line:90%
So we are on both.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.588 align:middle line:90%
we track the data very closely.

00:15:45.588 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
We're trying to see
what my response curve.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking
rapa blindly, it's

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.130 align:middle line:90%
really difficult thing to do.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
You really want to see how your
metabolizing it specifically,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:90%
and then hone in on that dose.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Rapamycin is something that
I think a lot of people are

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.600 align:middle line:84%
excited about, and I'm fairly
optimistic about rapamycin,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
but I'm waiting for
the clinical trials.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Either there's clinical trials
going on in dogs and companion

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
animals, and also starting
clinical trials in humans

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:90%
to see what this has an effect.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Rapamycin is very well-known
for slowing down aging.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But all of those claims are
made on a population level,

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and you just don't know
whether that effect is going

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:middle line:84%
to be realized and if
you're going to pick up

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:90%
any kind of side effects.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
I think people should be
very careful what they do.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.663 align:middle line:84%
Because if you take
something for 10 years

00:16:31.663 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:84%
and you think it's slowing down
your aging and then you find out

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.310 align:middle line:84%
it actually accelerated
it or you picked up

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.980 align:middle line:84%
cancer or something like that,
that's obviously a bad choice.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's a gamble, and
everyone has the right

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:84%
to gamble with their
body whatever they like.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In terms of a prediction of
what's possible for human life

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:55.120 align:middle line:84%
expectancy, as I said, I think
it's at least plausible that

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:84%
something like rapamycin or one
of the other interventions that

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
we're studying today could
have an impact of a decade,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:08.606 align:middle line:84%
maybe two decades, on healthy
life expectancy for most people.

00:17:08.606 --> 00:17:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people don't seem to
care that much about how long

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:90%
they live.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.182 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to their pets,
it's often a different story.

00:17:17.182 --> 00:17:20.109 align:middle line:84%
>> We see pet longevity as
being something that's a really

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:23.710 align:middle line:84%
important part of the human
longevity agenda because I think

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.890 align:middle line:84%
people need to become aware
of what's possible with these

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:27.890 align:middle line:90%
interventions.

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.220 align:middle line:10%
And if you're looking
at your dog as somebody

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.000 align:middle line:10%
that you want to
live longer and you

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.783 align:middle line:10%
can see that that's possible
in the interventions

00:17:34.783 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:10%
that you give them, they
get the same diseases as us

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.750 align:middle line:10%
in many respects, then
we see that that's

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.793 align:middle line:10%
going to be a very important
bridgehead for educating people

00:17:41.793 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:10%
on what's possible
for themselves.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Anybody who has
a dog, first of all,

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
recognizes that dogs age about
seven to 10 times faster than

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.680 align:middle line:84%
people do, but also that
dogs don't live long enough.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
We all love our pets, and
it's a horrible experience

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:84%
when your companion who you feel
is part of your family, goes

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:84%
through this decline
in a few years,

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.530 align:middle line:84%
that would be a few
decades in people.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately you have to make
the decision to let them go.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Even the interventions
that we have today,

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
there's a really good
likelihood that those

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:84%
could have a significant
impact on health and longevity,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.395 align:middle line:84%
both in companion
animals and in people.

00:18:17.395 --> 00:18:20.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Doing trials in humans takes
a long time to get a result.

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:25.830 align:middle line:84%
You can be waiting 60 or more,
many decades to get a result.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
In animal trials, we're able
to get drugs to animals faster

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.740 align:middle line:90%
in the cycle of testing.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And because their
lifespans are shorter,

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:37.442 align:middle line:84%
we can show an influence on
their lifespans a lot sooner.

00:18:37.442 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And what I can talk about is
that they're not on the market

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%
yet, but we're using them
for compassionate use.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing there is
that people's dogs are going

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
from old dogs to puppies again.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
The dog that used to not
want to go for a walk

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:84%
is now waiting at the
door to go for a walk.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.870 align:middle line:84%
The dog that they used
to take for a walk

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.430 align:middle line:84%
and it would be dragging
behind, is now out in front

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:90%
pulling on the lead.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, when you say,
do you want to live longer?

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.650 align:middle line:90%
People say, I'm not sure.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
But if you ask if they want
their dog to live longer,

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:09.242 align:middle line:84%
I've never found
somebody that says no.

00:19:09.242 --> 00:19:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Kidney disease is one of
the leading causes of death

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:14.230 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Could a drug that
targets kidney disease

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.742 align:middle line:84%
hold a promise to
slowing down aging?

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> There's something
called klotho.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:84%
Klotho is in every
animal, every human being.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a gene expression.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:84%
When it is high gene expression,
people live long, when it's low,

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.080 align:middle line:90%
you live less.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It determines your
brain as well.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
They believe it will have
an impact on dementia.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.750 align:middle line:84%
In animals, for
example, with mice,

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.190 align:middle line:84%
they take the klotho gene
out, and their life expectancy

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:90%
drops by 80%.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:84%
They expand the klotho gene,
in other words, the expression

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.640 align:middle line:84%
as they get older, it usually
like NAD, many other things,

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.340 align:middle line:84%
it shrinks, like stem cells,
they shrink, they drop.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.370 align:middle line:84%
But when they bring it back
to normal levels in mice,

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.050 align:middle line:90%
at least they live 30% longer.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.020 align:middle line:84%
It'd be the equivalent of 20
more years in a human being's

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So klotho was discovered
in the late '90s in Japan

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:84%
by a Japanese scientist that
was looking for treatments

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.500 align:middle line:90%
for hypertension.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Since then, there have been
over 6,000 academic studies

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and publications
looking at klotho.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.870 align:middle line:84%
Klotho is a circulating
hormone primarily produced

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
by the kidneys, which
declines with age.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.570 align:middle line:84%
So through research,
my scientific team,

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
we saw that there was a strong
correlation between kidney

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.430 align:middle line:90%
health and overall longevity.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Humans that have kidney
disease or kidney failure

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.020 align:middle line:90%
have low levels of klotho.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
And we see, just like in
the original mouse studies,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:90%
these humans rapidly age.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:90%
My kidney function was dropping.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
I measured my own klotho levels,
were low, and I just felt old.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.830 align:middle line:84%
My body fat was
close to 20%-25%.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.350 align:middle line:90%
I weighed almost 200 pounds.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:84%
Right before I needed
to go on dialysis,

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:90%
I had a kidney transplant.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.250 align:middle line:10%
And so about six months
after my kidney transplant,

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.940 align:middle line:10%
I tested my klotho levels,
and they went back up

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.590 align:middle line:10%
to the normal level.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:10%
I started feeling better.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.470 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I become younger
in many different ways.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're just going through
the safety protocols now.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Next year, they hope to start
their traditional approach

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:90%
with humans.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.908 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very excited about
testing that out and being

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:19.367 align:middle line:84%
a part of that process, because
everything I've seen so far

00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:84%
makes it fascinating
what it can do.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.880 align:middle line:84%
It's very big difference in your
body's ability to regenerate.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.625 align:middle line:84%
Also, clean organs in your
body, arteries in your body.

00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:27.425 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:21:27.425 --> 00:21:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We're developing this
as a regulated drug,

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.380 align:middle line:90%
not a nutritional supplement.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We'll go through FDA, clinical
trials starting next year

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and bring it to market
as soon as we can.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.545 align:middle line:90%
Kidney disease is a big problem.

00:21:43.545 --> 00:21:46.350 align:middle line:84%
40 million people
in the US alone

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.160 align:middle line:90%
have chronic kidney disease.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.617 align:middle line:84%
Half a million people a year
die from kidney disease.

00:21:51.617 --> 00:21:53.075 align:middle line:84%
And currently
there's no treatment.

00:21:53.075 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> So again, there's so many new
discoveries that are happening

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.010 align:middle line:90%
that can transform everything.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.802 align:middle line:84%
What you got to do is
take care of yourself

00:21:58.802 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
long enough so that these
technologies catch up with you.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:90%
That's really it.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.910 align:middle line:84%
If you do the right things
now, so you're around,

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:06.535 align:middle line:84%
you're probably going to live to
see these things because we're

00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:08.220 align:middle line:84%
at the base of a
geometric progression

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.485 align:middle line:84%
and understanding how we
can transform the body.

00:22:10.485 --> 00:22:15.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Many studies have shown in
animals and in humans that even

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:84%
a moderate amount of
exercise, walking,

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:84%
some light strength training
does increase natural production

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:90%
of klotho.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:84%
We suggest everybody get
in moderate exercise.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.896 align:middle line:90%
Healthy kidneys, longer life.

00:22:30.896 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>> What if we could program
our cells to become younger?

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:38.360 align:middle line:84%
That is the promise of
epigenetic reprogramming,

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.470 align:middle line:84%
a new field of science that
aims at reversing aging

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.982 align:middle line:90%
at the cellular level.

00:22:43.982 --> 00:22:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are some very
exciting therapies coming

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.360 align:middle line:90%
through.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of focus on
cellular reprogramming, which

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.403 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to take cells
back to a more youthful state,

00:22:53.403 --> 00:22:55.320 align:middle line:84%
but for them to still
maintain their identity.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:84%
>> If you s change
back that epigenome,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:84%
so that the right genes are on
and the wrong genes are off,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.993 align:middle line:84%
can we revert you
to a younger age?

00:23:06.993 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
believe that we can.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing skin cells being
reversed by decades, 30 years.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.675 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing blind mice
regaining their vision.

00:23:15.675 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> We also know now that you
can take cells of a given type

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and turn them into a
completely different types,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
so you can make a
skin cell a neuron.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And then now, I think
the most exciting thing

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that you could take an
old cell and turn it back

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:90%
into a seemingly young cell.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So I think we have a lot to
prove on whether we can actually

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:39.300 align:middle line:84%
do that in a whole body, like
a human, and do it safely.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But I think, just the scientific
discovery itself is so exciting,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.917 align:middle line:84%
and I think opens up a
whole number of pathways

00:23:45.917 --> 00:23:46.750 align:middle line:90%
that we can go down.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's looking very promising,
and we need something

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
that's very precise for
those clinical trials.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll see where the science
goes in the next 20-30 years.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:90%
It's really hard to predict.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe epigenetic reprogramming
will be the breakthrough

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:84%
that everybody is
hoping it will be.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:10%
And we can see
substantially larger impacts

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.955 align:middle line:10%
on health span and lifespan, but
we'll just have to wait and see.

00:24:08.955 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>> The FDA is known for their
rigorous approval process

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
for new drugs, and it often
takes decades and hundreds

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.310 align:middle line:84%
of millions of dollars to
get a new drug approved.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:10%
In the field of longevity,
there is a group

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.510 align:middle line:10%
of people known as
biohackers that don't want

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.700 align:middle line:10%
to wait for official approvals.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:32.690 align:middle line:10%
Many call them reckless, others
refer to them as innovators.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Recently, I tripped
and I fell and I had to go

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.237 align:middle line:84%
to the doctor and
get it sewn up.

00:24:37.237 --> 00:24:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And I went there,
this is an emergency

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.570 align:middle line:90%
room in a mountainous area.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.403 align:middle line:84%
He said, sir, are you
on any medications?

00:24:42.403 --> 00:24:44.320 align:middle line:84%
I thought, oh, boy, this
is going to be tough.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.732 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, I'll
just give it a go.

00:24:46.732 --> 00:24:48.190 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I'm
taking metformin.

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:90%
He said, the drug for diabetics?

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.880 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.290 align:middle line:90%
I said, yeah, rapamycin.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The drug people give when
you're doing a organ transplant?

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Anything else?

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I said yeah, dasatinib.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.790 align:middle line:90%
The leukemia drug?

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Good Lord, son,
what are you doing?

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was a good
reminder of the things

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that we do for the Blueprint
protocol of slowing

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:84%
my rate of aging
and rejuvenation

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.910 align:middle line:84%
are so outside the norm, it
just strikes people as bizarre.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:15.480 align:middle line:10%
But we take a whole bunch of
basic things like vitamins

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:10%
and minerals, and much more
advanced things like metformin,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:10%
rapamycin or acarbose,
which are prescription only

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:10%
and are on the cutting
edge of aging science.

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Doctors can repurpose drugs.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
It's not against the
law to repurpose drugs.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And there are doctors
who would give them

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:36.000 align:middle line:84%
metformin, that would give them
a rapamycin, that will give them

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:90%
senolytics.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.890 align:middle line:84%
So it's out there, and
people are using that.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to have
the data from that.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:90%
We're going to trust the data.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But people who are aging
don't have the patience

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.740 align:middle line:84%
to wait 10 years
for a drug approval.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm essentially
a longevity hacker.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:84%
I try things for me because
I need these things.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time
to wait five or 10

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:84%
years for some kind of a big
scientific study to be approved.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.700 align:middle line:84%
Part of that is also
the understanding

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:84%
that any kind of
a scientific study

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:84%
is based on some solution,
that in some sense,

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.530 align:middle line:90%
will work for the whole public.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not the whole public.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm one person.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.570 align:middle line:84%
If it works for me,
that's good enough.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:22.680 align:middle line:90%
I've got so much I want to do.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.570 align:middle line:90%
I need 500 years.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.290 align:middle line:84%
When you approach life with
that kind of expectation,

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:31.615 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden you're not
looking at the end of your life.

00:26:31.615 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you get very old,
a lot of these things that are

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:84%
of dubious benefit, or at
least hard to measure benefit.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.090 align:middle line:84%
For younger, older
people, it starts

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:90%
to be worth taking a shot, so.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> They're sophisticated
biohackers,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.480 align:middle line:90%
many of them are scientists.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So the goal here is to
hang around and catch up.

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the whole concept
of longevity escape velocity

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.950 align:middle line:84%
to stay around until
science catches up,

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.076 align:middle line:84%
until regulations allow the
science to treat these aging

00:27:03.076 --> 00:27:03.876 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:27:03.876 --> 00:27:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the first
thing to say about

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:84%
the self-experimentation
community is they have a lot

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:90%
of improvement to do.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do this
stuff, hope is not sufficient.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:84%
You must measure
before and after.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:19.050 align:middle line:84%
You must test the compounds
you're ordering from wherever

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.380 align:middle line:90%
you're ordering them from.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.800 align:middle line:90%
You have to do this properly.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And frankly,
self-experimentation

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.070 align:middle line:84%
has a great history in the
scientific community that it

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:90%
has a bad rep these days.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.320 align:middle line:84%
If you look back in the 1800s or
even like the middle of the last

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
century, people are out there
injecting themselves and testing

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.490 align:middle line:90%
things on themselves.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And bold and brave scientists
are actually making progress

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:90%
based upon this.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's an entirely
viable approach

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.300 align:middle line:84%
that is somewhat diluted
by, not to be too offensive,

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
all the idiots whose approach to
it is, hey, let's try this thing

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and see how I feel.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.140 align:middle line:90%
You just can't do that.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.220 align:middle line:84%
We live in a world in which most
people know more about their car

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.660 align:middle line:84%
than they know about the
operation of their body,

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:90%
and that's criminal.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.440 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't be the case,
but it is what it is.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Technological breakthroughs
in longevity are moving

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.560 align:middle line:84%
at incredible speed, and
advances in nanotechnology might

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.862 align:middle line:90%
be just around the corner.

00:28:12.862 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> We are at the
beginnings of nanomedicine.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And by nanomedicine,
I mean, injecting

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
tiny, tiny, tiny little
machines into our body

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:26.140 align:middle line:84%
to go in and do repair work
in cells that have aged

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.970 align:middle line:84%
and have lost their ability
to reproduce effectively.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.450 align:middle line:90%
I think that's really exciting.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Nanotechs is developing
injectable biodegradable

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.340 align:middle line:90%
nanoparticles called nanos.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:10%
And the amazing
thing about nanos

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:10%
is that instead of adding
things to the body,

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:10%
they take things out.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:44.750 align:middle line:10%
They take the junk out.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Think of them as little
tiny sponges that

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.730 align:middle line:84%
circulate in the body, and
they absorb harmful substances

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:57.075 align:middle line:84%
that contribute to inflammation,
aging, cancer, and sepsis.

00:28:57.075 --> 00:29:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And they go and clean up
the mess that accumulates with

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:90%
aging.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.090 align:middle line:84%
They're able to unmask
cancer for the immune system.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The same treatment is able to
address senescent cells as well.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.360 align:middle line:84%
This is a pretty
exciting new technology.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.320 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea is to receive
these injections periodically

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and clear out these harmful junk
that shouldn't be in the body

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.810 align:middle line:90%
and needs to be taken out.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:24.080 align:middle line:84%
In the near future, these
nanotechs and other longevity

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:84%
treatments will be used
first in clinical trials

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.020 align:middle line:90%
to treat diseases.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And nanotechs specifically
will do clinical trials

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
to treat cancer in the
Massachusetts General Hospital

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and in the Mayo Clinic,
and to treat sepsis

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:37.738 align:middle line:90%
at the Cleveland Clinic.

00:29:37.738 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:84%
So three of the best
hospitals in the world

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.835 align:middle line:84%
are focusing on this
novel nanotechnology.

00:29:42.835 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Senescent cells can
be a problem for aging,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:10%
and the field of senolytics is
searching for ways to tackle

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.962 align:middle line:10%
these pesky little zombie cells.

00:29:52.962 --> 00:29:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So cells are dividing,
but there's a limit

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.460 align:middle line:90%
to their division.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.120 align:middle line:84%
After 50 divisions, they
cannot divide anymore,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:84%
and they become what
we call senescent.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:09.680 align:middle line:84%
When they become senescent,
they're changing their biology,

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting
to accumulate

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:84%
lots of proteins and
inflammatory markers

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that are being secreted
to their environment.

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they sit there and
they just disrupt everything.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:84%
If you get rid of them get
pretty much instant rejuvenation

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.590 align:middle line:90%
in days in mice.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.820 align:middle line:84%
You can take old mice, clear
out, let's say, 30% to 50%

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.440 align:middle line:84%
of the senescent cells that
are lingering in their tissues.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
laundry list as long

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.320 align:middle line:84%
as your arm of diseases
that reverse considerably

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.050 align:middle line:84%
when you do that, from arthritis
to the enlargement of the heart,

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.290 align:middle line:84%
the weakening of the heart
muscle that reverses.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:84%
All sorts of stuff
that you might think,

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.260 align:middle line:90%
wow, this is never going away.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a really profound change.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:51.000 align:middle line:84%
The drugs that are used
now in mice to test

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and are being trialed
in humans may turn out

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to be the best
Alzheimer's treatment

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:90%
of the next few decades.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.680 align:middle line:10%
Because Alzheimer's
itself appears to evolve

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:10%
and most other
neurodegenerative diseases

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:10%
appear to involve senescent
cells in the brain,

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.626 align:middle line:10%
messing up the shop
with their secretions.

00:31:06.626 --> 00:31:10.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Senolytics did not exist
basically one decade ago,

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.270 align:middle line:84%
and we are discovering
now senolytic treatments,

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:17.200 align:middle line:84%
which will be pills or
injections that will eliminate

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.555 align:middle line:90%
the zombie cells.

00:31:18.555 --> 00:31:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So senescent cells
accumulate in our system.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And even though there
aren't a lot of these,

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:25.113 align:middle line:90%
they're highly pro-inflammatory.

00:31:25.113 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:84%
So they're excreting
all these different

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.870 align:middle line:84%
what we call cytokines or
pro-inflammatory factors.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.800 align:middle line:84%
These can actually then
damage nearby cells,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.030 align:middle line:84%
and either actually make them
become senescent or potentially

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:40.540 align:middle line:84%
actually transform them
into precancerous cells that

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.885 align:middle line:90%
could go on to create tumors.

00:31:42.885 --> 00:31:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The development of senolytics
is really probably unique

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in the annals of
recent medical history,

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:55.300 align:middle line:84%
because the first drug they dug
up to try on animals is actually

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.810 align:middle line:90%
really, really good.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:84%
The dasatinib,
quercetin combination

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:90%
has yet to be bested.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of the
other senolytics

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:84%
where we actually have
data for how good are they

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.110 align:middle line:84%
at clearing versus what
are the side effects,

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.110 align:middle line:84%
they're not better than
dasatinib and quercetin.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So you have this
fascinating dynamic

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.440 align:middle line:84%
where a drug that is approved
and a supplement together could

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.420 align:middle line:84%
be used off label, could
be used now off label.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.340 align:middle line:84%
There are people out
there using it now.

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the trials
yet to back that up,

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.140 align:middle line:90%
and that's a bit criminal.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.840 align:middle line:84%
They're going very slowly
because it's an approved drug,

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:90%
it exists.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.900 align:middle line:90%
It costs next to nothing.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.540 align:middle line:84%
There's absolutely
zero incentive

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:37.850 align:middle line:84%
for any of the big players to
try to take this existing drug

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:38.963 align:middle line:90%
and put it through trials.

00:32:38.963 --> 00:32:40.130 align:middle line:90%
The trials are all academic.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I'm not going to
tell people what they should

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:43.530 align:middle line:90%
and shouldn't do.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I would say
personally, I would not

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.840 align:middle line:84%
be taking dasatinib
and quercetin

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:84%
at this stage as a healthy
individual who is not suffering

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.940 align:middle line:90%
from a deleterious disease.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think, there's
plenty of time

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.170 align:middle line:84%
to wait and see
how this pans out.

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:01.055 align:middle line:84%
I would also argue that for
most young, healthy people,

00:33:01.055 --> 00:33:04.490 align:middle line:84%
you aren't at the level of
senescent cell accumulation

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.970 align:middle line:84%
that this probably will
make a huge difference.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:11.820 align:middle line:10%
And I think we don't really know
to what degree prevention really

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.670 align:middle line:10%
early on before you have much
senescent cell accumulation

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:18.065 align:middle line:10%
is really going to impact
the burden later on.

00:33:18.065 --> 00:33:20.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm not convinced that
we know the full story about

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:90%
senescent cells.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't yet know
which senescent

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.260 align:middle line:84%
cells we need to remove,
and which ones need to stay.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Because the process
of senescence,

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.530 align:middle line:90%
it helps to reduce cancer rates.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.950 align:middle line:84%
So we probably don't
want our old cells

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:33.780 align:middle line:84%
from dividing because
they've probably

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.520 align:middle line:90%
got damaged DNA or mutated DNA.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want those mutations
to proliferate or to grow.

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:42.460 align:middle line:10%
So we use senescence to
stop that from happening.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.280 align:middle line:10%
So we don't want to
be stopping senescent.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.938 align:middle line:10%
Senescence also has a crucial
role to play in wound healing.

00:33:46.938 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:10%
So again, we want to make
sure that we're clearing away

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.010 align:middle line:10%
specific old cells.

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:53.490 align:middle line:84%
But we're not too sure which
cells yet to clear away,

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and which molecules
can do that best.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very hopeful around
this area of research,

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.510 align:middle line:84%
but a lot more research
needs to be done first

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.710 align:middle line:84%
until we can actually
use this in humans.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.000 align:middle line:90%
