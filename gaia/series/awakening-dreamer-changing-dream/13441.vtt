00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And you have that ability
to use the power of images

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.720 align:middle line:84%
to propel you into the
movement, the direction

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.280 align:middle line:90%
that you wish to go.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.080 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like us to think also
about where we want to go

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.570 align:middle line:90%
and what is emerging.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And it makes me think of media.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked today
a couple of times

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.290 align:middle line:84%
about social media,
the internet.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And just thinking about TV and
all those different sources

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:84%
of what we see, is that can
you imagine if just a fraction

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
of that would be
spent on the issues

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that we've been talking about,
about creating this new dream

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:84%
that is environmentally
sustainable, spiritually

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:90%
fulfilling and socially just.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can imagine that
happening-- and the reality,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.220 align:middle line:84%
it is already emerging,
it is already happening.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd like to show you
this short video to get a sense

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
of how that is occurring.

is, who do we need to be?

towards something that
we firmly believe in.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And now here we are,
we're gathered together

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.110 align:middle line:84%
by the purpose of
this symposium,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
bringing forth an
environmentally

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.370 align:middle line:84%
sustainable, spiritually
fulfilling, socially just human

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:90%
presence.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And I want to offer all
of us the opportunity

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
now to take a stand in our lives
that affirm that, that purpose.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.450 align:middle line:84%
And so Anita's going
to come and join

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.701 align:middle line:84%
us and lead us just through the
opportunity to declare a stand.

00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Thanks.
Do you mind passing those out?

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.270 align:middle line:84%
So what John is passing
out is a declaration card.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And I filled out one of
these four years ago.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:10%
And on the front is the
purpose of the symposium,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.430 align:middle line:10%
the commitment of bringing
forth an environmentally

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:10%
sustainable, spiritually
fulfilling and socially

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.270 align:middle line:10%
just human presence.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.370 align:middle line:10%
And on the back is the George
Bernard Shaw quote that you

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.358 align:middle line:10%
just heard on the video.

00:10:10.358 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all
have the opportunity

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
to say what our life is about,
what we stand for, who we are.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:84%
And I've found that the
power of taking a stand

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
is larger, greater, more
potent than I ever thought.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.270 align:middle line:84%
When we take a stand,
we move from having

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:84%
a point of view about the world
to actually having vision.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And from vision, your
life can really matter.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.790 align:middle line:84%
You can really
make a difference.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to take out
your declaration card

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and to sign it, affirming
your own commitment

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:84%
to an environmentally
sustainable,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.460 align:middle line:84%
spiritually fulfilling,
socially just

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:90%
human presence on this planet.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Whether you sign this
declaration or not

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.550 align:middle line:90%
is up to you.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you do sign
the card, I suggest

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.610 align:middle line:84%
you put it up somewhere
at home or at your office

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.220 align:middle line:90%
where you'll see it.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.710 align:middle line:84%
It will remind you of
your personal commitment

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:10.295 align:middle line:84%
to be an agent of change in
the world, a global citizen who

00:11:10.295 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
is working to shift the course
of history, turn the tide

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and transform our future
into the one we want.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Once you take this stand, your
life will never be the same.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:90%
I know, because I did it.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.370 align:middle line:10%
