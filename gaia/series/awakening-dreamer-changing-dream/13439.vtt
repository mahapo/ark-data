00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Thank you all.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, thank you very much.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.490 align:middle line:84%
We want to continue to talk
about some other possibilities

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.250 align:middle line:90%
that you may want to add.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Some of you were already
speaking of them.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.140 align:middle line:84%
And that is how
to stay connected

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.720 align:middle line:84%
to this community, the
Awakening the Dreamer community.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.400 align:middle line:84%
JON SYMES: And the invitations
to go there and join into what

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:84%
is a huge and growing worldwide
community of agents of change

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:90%
like you like us all.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
you'll find an entry

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.650 align:middle line:84%
into the entire community
around the world

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.430 align:middle line:84%
as well as in the
places where you live.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.480 align:middle line:84%
You'll find groups of people
gathering together in person as

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
well as online, so find your
way to the in-person community

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.020 align:middle line:84%
by finding the connections
that are there on that website.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I also want to let you
know that, for young people,

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
there is a-- a sister
of this organization

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
actually came out
of The Awakening

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
the Dreamer, which is
Generation Waking Up.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is similar--
is the same material,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.960 align:middle line:84%
but it has another umph
and energy to it that's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.250 align:middle line:90%
really inviting younger people.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we want you to be aware
of that Generation Waking Up.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.166 align:middle line:90%
The symposium really starts now.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
When we are apart
from each other,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.680 align:middle line:84%
when we've refined each other,
we build more communities.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
We step further in our
stand in our commitment.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And we can see in your
eyes and in your voice

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.540 align:middle line:84%
all the shifts
that have happened.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.230 align:middle line:84%
We'd like to give you just
this moment if anyone wants

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to share, in the large
community, anything that has

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.280 align:middle line:84%
happened for you, where
you are, what's shifted,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.920 align:middle line:84%
or anything to just be able
to share that right now.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.805 align:middle line:84%
I feel empowered
now, and on my paper

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
I have four or five easy
steps that I can do.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.380 align:middle line:84%
I just feel opened
and reconnected

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
to things that I know are
driving impulses in my life.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not about how
everyone's treating me.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.729 align:middle line:84%
It's about how I'm treating
everyone and everything else.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:90%
The power is within all of us.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:90%
And the time is now.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:90%
What are we waiting for?

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm excited to just
get the ball roll

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and making an impact
on my own community.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
As human beings, we're not
flawed, we're just mistaken.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Going under the assumption
that we were, in some way,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
flawed for the
way we're treating

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.690 align:middle line:90%
our world removed hope.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
The notion that we're
instead mistaken,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:84%
we're just given the
wrong information,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:90%
restores that hope.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.640 align:middle line:84%
There's so much gratitude is
running through me right now.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these
ideas were not new.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.220 align:middle line:84%
All of them maybe
weren't that new.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
But the idea that
it's just so exciting

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
and the possibility that's
open right now in that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:90%
it's actually happening.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
that's happening

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
in the future or later,
but that it's going on now.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.210 align:middle line:84%
The little shift happened here
could make a huge difference.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:90%
And that was so powerful.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And each one of us--
and allows us to take

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.880 align:middle line:90%
that in in our individual way.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It feels like an invitation
to integrate my beliefs

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that I've been caring for
so long into how I'm being

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:90%
and who I'm being.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And that message really
came through clearly

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.160 align:middle line:84%
for me about really coming from
who I want to be in this world.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.595 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for this
beautiful invitation.

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:32.320 align:middle line:90%
I accept.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.220 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: As we
look to the future,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:84%
there's a metaphor from
nature that can serve us.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.900 align:middle line:84%
When a caterpillar reaches a
certain point in its evolution,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
it becomes over-consumptive,
a voracious eater

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
that consumes hundreds
of times its own weight.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.930 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, inside
the molecular structure

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.330 align:middle line:84%
of the caterpillar, something
called the imaginal cells

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:90%
become active.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
They wake up, look
for each other,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and begin to cluster inside
the caterpillar's body.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.930 align:middle line:84%
When enough of them connect,
even though they're not

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
in the majority, they become the
genetic directors of the future

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.640 align:middle line:90%
of the caterpillar.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.220 align:middle line:84%
At that point, the other cells
begin to dissolve and become

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.460 align:middle line:84%
what's called the
nutritive soup,

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
out of which the
imaginal cells create

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.380 align:middle line:84%
the absolutely unpredictable
miracle of the butterfly.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.040 align:middle line:84%
What's possible is that
we are the imaginal cells

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.168 align:middle line:90%
on the planet now.

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:10%
We don't need any
hero on a white horse.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:10%
We're the people we've
been waiting for.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You already have within you
enough love to save the planet.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:10%
If you have hope
in you're heart,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:10%
and even if you're the
only person left who

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:10%
has hope in their heart, if that
hope is committed in action,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:10%
then there's hope for the world.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
If you're the only
person left, as long

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.810 align:middle line:84%
as your hope is
committed in action,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:90%
then hope is alive in the world.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
AL GORE: There's an old African
proverb that some of you

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.140 align:middle line:84%
know this says if you want
to go quickly, go alone.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go
far, go together.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:10%
We have to go far quickly.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:10%
So we have to have a
change in consciousness,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.680 align:middle line:10%
a change in commitment,
a new sense of urgency,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.320 align:middle line:10%
a new appreciation
for the privilege

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:10%
that we have of
undertaking this challenge.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.170 align:middle line:10%
WANGARI MAATHAI: In
the course of history,

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.710 align:middle line:10%
there comes a time
when humanity is called

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.780 align:middle line:10%
to shift to a new
level of consciousness

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:10%
to reach a higher moral
ground, a time when

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.890 align:middle line:10%
we have to shed our fear
and give hope to each other.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:90%
That time is now.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:10%
Every single one of us
came through something

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:10%
to make a difference.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
You can.
You can.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.582 align:middle line:90%
I can.

00:06:17.582 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:90%
God bless you.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.920 align:middle line:90%
JON SYMES: So here we are.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Can we all see each other.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:90%
How wonderful!

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.840 align:middle line:84%
So deep, deep acknowledgement
to each of you for being here,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
for being open, for listening,
re-appraising, committing,

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:90%
opening your hearts.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.790 align:middle line:84%
I just want to say that it's
wonderful to have the privilege

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to hear you and see
you and then just know

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
that there's millions and
hundreds of millions of us

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:90%
all over the world.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
You are now part of a
growing movement of people

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.530 align:middle line:84%
in every village, every
town, in every city,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
on every continent on this
magnificent earth who are now

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.990 align:middle line:84%
awake to the urgency
and the opportunity

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.040 align:middle line:84%
of this amazing time in
history and, like you,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.470 align:middle line:84%
are committed to bringing forth
an environmentally sustainable,

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.630 align:middle line:84%
spiritually fulfilling,
and socially just human

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.400 align:middle line:90%
presence on this planet.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:84%
What an extraordinary
time to be alive.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.107 align:middle line:84%
No other generation
in history has

00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:33.330 align:middle line:84%
faced the challenges and the
opportunities we now face.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.520 align:middle line:84%
And that means that we
have the opportunity

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to live the most
meaningful lives

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:84%
that any generation of human
beings have ever lived.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations and thank you.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:09:15.400 align:middle line:90%
