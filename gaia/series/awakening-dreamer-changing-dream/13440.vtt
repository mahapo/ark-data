00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Just like you,
there are thousands,

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.140 align:middle line:84%
I think tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, maybe

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.160 align:middle line:84%
millions of people around
the world taking a stand

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.150 align:middle line:84%
to be part of an
environmentally sustainable

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and spiritually fulfilling
and socially just future.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And so with this stand, we're
actually saying to the world

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:90%
that we're agents of change.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.031 align:middle line:84%
We're stepping into a phenomenon
which we've seen on screen,

00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:24.730 align:middle line:90%
haven't we?

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It's sweeping around the world
and we're joining into it.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:84%
We're joining our
hearts into it,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.100 align:middle line:84%
we're joining our
action into it.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And so thank you for this.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And then together let's
look at what it takes

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.600 align:middle line:90%
for us to find our next steps.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have a couple of
ideas to share with you.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.381 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like to do this.
-Yeah.

00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes.
We'll do that together.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to
stay, to sustain

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.010 align:middle line:84%
that stand, that
commitment, we need to look

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:90%
at where do we go from here.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.910 align:middle line:90%
And we have a few suggestions.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.130 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the very
big powers of this symposium

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:90%
is that's not prescriptive.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.819 align:middle line:84%
It's just opening up
possibilities to you.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that we trust
your own genius.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.840 align:middle line:84%
But a few things that we know
has worked for us as helpful

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.580 align:middle line:84%
is first of all, a way
to stay in your stand

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.620 align:middle line:90%
and sustain it is to stay awake.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.731 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds easy.
Stay awake.

00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah.
I can stay awake.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really easy
to go back to sleep.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you may find when
you get into reflection

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
place of where do-- how
am I going to stay awake?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's doing this.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.270 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
getting educated.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:90%
And that sounds pretty dry.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.640 align:middle line:90%
It's about being just curious.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen you
throughout the symposium

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and how you have just
leaned into everything.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.040 align:middle line:84%
It's that kind of curiosity
in all the areas--

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.140 align:middle line:84%
environmental sustainability,
social justice,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.280 align:middle line:84%
as well as spiritual
fulfillment.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we stay awake,
if we get educated,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:90%
what about get connected?

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, because when we're
connected with each other,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:90%
it helps to stay awake.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.280 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got the buddies with
whom we can get more educated.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be that we're
already involved in a group.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
We're already involved
in a community,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.050 align:middle line:90%
a community of practice maybe.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.170 align:middle line:84%
A community sharing
the common practice

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
of speaking this new
conversation into the world.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly
what the community

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:90%
of awakening the dreamer is.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So it might be you're
already involved

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.640 align:middle line:90%
in a community like that.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
It could be that the
possibility of joining

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
into this larger
worldwide community we've

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.010 align:middle line:90%
been sharing about.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that
it's time to join

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:84%
something you're aware of in
your own neighborhood now.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
But the power of being connected
is really important for us.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth
point we had was to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
just to think about
communicating.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:10%
As Anita says, when
she communicates

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:10%
she is spreading this
conversation in the world.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And it might be that you
could take something as simple

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.210 align:middle line:90%
as the wombat.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
Take the wombat video and just
post that to your friends.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be that you
choose to learn to be

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:90%
able to share this symposium.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be able
to tell you how

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:90%
to take that option as well.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all of you can
actually download-- even today--

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.810 align:middle line:84%
download all the materials
we're sharing with you

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.320 align:middle line:84%
and the instructions on how
to run an event like this

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle line:90%
and do it anyway.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, that's about
communicating into the world.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's the fourth
idea that seems

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
so relevant to us staying
powerfully in our stand

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.890 align:middle line:90%
and in action.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.035 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, this
is not prescriptive.

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.720 align:middle line:84%
We're not gonna tell
you, this is what you do.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.580 align:middle line:90%
We really do trust your genius.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.420 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, we
want to give you a way

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:90%
to look at, where do you start?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.050 align:middle line:84%
Where does all this action,
both the being and the doing,

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:90%
where does that happen?

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I want to
start with I or you.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.580 align:middle line:10%
So the I. There are many things
you can do as an individual.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:10%
You've already talked
about some of them.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.130 align:middle line:84%
Living more lightly on the
planet by changing the way

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.130 align:middle line:90%
you eat.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Paying attention to how
things are packaged.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Just consuming less in general.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:10%
Changing your transportation.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.580 align:middle line:10%
All sorts of things
that you can do

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:10%
and that you may
already be doing.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.870 align:middle line:10%
Then there's this other
area that's very important.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:10%
This is the community.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:10%
With your family,
friends, neighbors,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:10%
religious and social
groups, what can you bring?

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
What conversations or projects
could you introduce there?

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.575 align:middle line:84%
How can you support them
in getting involved?

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:10%
If we're interested in changing
the dream of the modern world,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.810 align:middle line:10%
we also need to
consider the larger

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:10%
social institutions--
governments,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.040 align:middle line:10%
educational systems.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.760 align:middle line:10%
All those kinds of
things we're looking

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:10%
at that we need to unpack too.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.390 align:middle line:10%
So include those
arenas in thinking

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:10%
about what you want to do.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:10%
And what we're going for is for
this new dream, this world that

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:10%
is environmentally
sustainable, spiritually

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:10%
fulfilling, and socially just.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.890 align:middle line:10%
So recognize yourself
and celebrate

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.380 align:middle line:10%
what's happening here.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.290 align:middle line:90%
And push yourself.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.120 align:middle line:84%
As we say, blessed
unrest to do more.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But understand if we want
change to happen out here,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
if this is the
thing that we want

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
to have happen in the
culture in the world,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:84%
it's going to require
some being and doing

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.270 align:middle line:90%
at all those different levels.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the question is yours
and the choice is yours.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm handing out
to you now is a matrix.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And you might think of this
almost as the landscape

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:90%
in which we can take action.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's got these three
distinctions here.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:90%
What can I do individually?

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:90%
What can I do in community?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:10%
And what can I do at the
level of the institutions

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:10%
or the systems of power
in the place where I live?

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then across the top you can
see we've got our three lenses.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:10%
We've got the environmental,
spiritual, and social concern.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that as the landscape
in which you might find

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:84%
your unique talents,
experience, and your passion

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.080 align:middle line:84%
for the world coinciding
with what you see

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.740 align:middle line:84%
is needed in the
world right now.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.220 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that's
what's happening now.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.670 align:middle line:84%
These forces are running
together in each of us

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
here for us to find where
our contribution can be.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.950 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
somewhere on this map.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if you
can find three--

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.460 align:middle line:84%
maybe more, but
certainly three-- actions

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that you can see you
can take as of now.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.120 align:middle line:84%
I think that when historians
look back at this time,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:84%
they will see it as the most
remarkable moment in all

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.560 align:middle line:84%
of human history, the pivotal
time when we as a human family

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.210 align:middle line:84%
took it upon ourselves
to summon the will

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.240 align:middle line:84%
to make the changes that altered
the course of history forever.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:90%
OK, Lynn, you might say.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
That is so huge, so beyond what
I, as one little individual,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.250 align:middle line:90%
can do.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:90%
Where do I fit in?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.520 align:middle line:90%
Where do I start?

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are all
great questions.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.860 align:middle line:90%
Here's what I would say.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:84%
Start where you are right now
and who you are right now.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Pick five actions that you are
going to be committed to taking

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:90%
out of this experience.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you just a
few ideas to get you started,

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.420 align:middle line:84%
but the actions you
come up with will be way

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.540 align:middle line:90%
more powerful than anything.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.690 align:middle line:84%
You can come up
with your own as you

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.140 align:middle line:84%
just look at your
life, your work,

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.150 align:middle line:90%
what you're passionate about.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:84%
For example, remember
the part where

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
it was said that
people in the US

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
throw away more than 600
million plastic bottles

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.275 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:07:47.275 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:90%
That was just stunning to me.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.920 align:middle line:90%
That was a show stopper.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:84%
When I heard that, I
couldn't even believe it.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing, perhaps,
to be one of the people

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:84%
who maybe never again uses
another plastic water bottle

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.490 align:middle line:84%
or certainly thinks about
it before you purchase one?

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.340 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you would refill
your bottle instead.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Think about the
last time, if ever,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
you let your voice be heard by
you're elected representatives.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.040 align:middle line:84%
Are you willing to speak
out to your government about

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:90%
the issues that you care about?

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:middle line:10%
There has never
been a more critical

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.210 align:middle line:10%
time than now to exercise
the muscle of our democracy.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Look at how you use your money.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.580 align:middle line:84%
Because our spending
habits are driving

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
the dream of the modern world,
the dream we don't want.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.400 align:middle line:84%
How much stuff do
you really need?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:10%
Before you buy something, look
at how and where it's made.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:90%
Look at where you're investing.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Think about using your
money to support the causes

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.291 align:middle line:90%
you really believe in.

00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Look and see where in your
life you shut people out,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
people who may be
a different color

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.140 align:middle line:84%
or people who speak
another language

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.390 align:middle line:90%
or follow other faiths.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
People you think are too old
or too young or too different

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.750 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:84%
And go out of your way to
include them in your life.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Communicate,
communicate, communicate,

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.000 align:middle line:90%
then communicate some more.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Tell at least five people
about this experience,

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:90%
what you learned here.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Invite them to
participate as well.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Gather a group to do
this experience together.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Tell your online
friends on Facebook.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.950 align:middle line:90%
Get the word out.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
It will keep you awake and
deepen your own commitment

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.490 align:middle line:90%
to share it with other people.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:90%
We cannot do this alone.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And the good news
is, we don't have to.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.630 align:middle line:90%
Together we are a genius.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.220 align:middle line:84%
Now I bet there's
some great ideas here.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what we'd
love you to do now

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.170 align:middle line:84%
is, again, just turn to your
friends on the table, please.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And we need you to just share
three of the ideas you've got.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
The power of you
saying it in words

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.310 align:middle line:84%
to other people may be
inviting their help,

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.430 align:middle line:84%
if only to witness
you, is really great.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.551 align:middle line:84%
So let's turn to that
now, if you would.

00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:11.659 align:middle line:84%
Thank you.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.760 align:middle line:84%
We'd like to hear just a couple
of shares of what are some

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.810 align:middle line:84%
of the things that you have
committed to, that you put down

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and shared with your
people at your table.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.070 align:middle line:84%
We don't compost because we
don't have a yard or any place

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:90%
to put the compost.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But I have several friends
in town with large homes

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:90%
and backyards who do compost.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:84%
So my next project set up
composting for our places

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.640 align:middle line:84%
and just arrange
to do it with them.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I have a great passion for
how we treat people in prisons.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And I want to see not prison
reform, but present revolution.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So that we treat people like
they're valuable resources.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:59.011 align:middle line:84%
And people who make mistakes,
we figure out what to do.

00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm taking my energy into the
area of helping people open

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.080 align:middle line:90%
their hearts and keep it open.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:84%
On a macro level, it's
about consuming less.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
about recycling more.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So my commitment is to not bring
any new plastic into my house.
