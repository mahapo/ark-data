00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Hello, and welcome to
"Awakening the Dreamer,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Changing the Dream."

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.460 align:middle line:10%
I'm Lynne Twist, the co-founder
of the Pachamama Alliance,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:10%
the organization responsible for
developing this unique program.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
The word "pachamama"
comes from South America,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
from the Quechua people of
the Amazon and the Andes,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.840 align:middle line:84%
where "pachamama"
means "Mother Earth"--

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
or more completely to
them, the earth, the sky,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.300 align:middle line:90%
the universe, and all time.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.570 align:middle line:84%
First, let me thank you
for being someone who cares

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.100 align:middle line:84%
enough about our precious
planet and the human family

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to take the time to participate
in this important program.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee that you'll
be really glad you did.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
We're living in amazing times,
as you may have noticed.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So much is changing
around us all the time.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Some extraordinary
changes are for the good.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:84%
But some bring up real
fears about the future.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you may find yourself
worrying about the state

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:84%
of the world and
questioning if there's

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:90%
anything you can do about it.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
This experience
you're taking part in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is about both the urgency and
the opportunity of our times.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:10%
As we will see, humanity is on
an entirely unsustainable path.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And we have a limited time
to turn things around.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:10%
But you'll also discover
something unexpected

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:10%
and profoundly inspiring.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the resources
and technologies to address

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:90%
this crisis already exist.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Many experts say
that what is missing

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.860 align:middle line:84%
is the will to implement
the solutions--

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
the human commitment
to make it happen.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.350 align:middle line:84%
This experience is an
opportunity for you to wake

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
up to your own role in
creating a new future--

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.800 align:middle line:84%
your part in generating
the collective will

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
needed to set us on a
path to a thriving, just,

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:84%
and sustainable way
of life for all.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.240 align:middle line:84%
The "Awakening the Dreamer,
Changing the Dream"

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Program was born out
of a relationship

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
between the Pachamama
Alliance and indigenous people

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.345 align:middle line:90%
of the Amazon rain forest.

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:55.047 align:middle line:90%


00:02:55.047 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE NARRATOR:
These are the Achuar

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.650 align:middle line:84%
people, one of our planet's
most remote indigenous groups.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
The Achuar are an
ancient dream culture,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
still living in harmony
with their ancestral land--

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
nearly two million acres
of pristine tropical rain

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.657 align:middle line:90%
forest in Ecuador and Peru.

00:03:12.657 --> 00:03:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.120 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1980s, the
Achuar elders and shamans

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.870 align:middle line:84%
began having dreams and
visions that a grave threat

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:90%
was coming to their people.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.440 align:middle line:10%
The Achuar soon realised what
that threat was as they began

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:10%
to see what contact with the
outside world and its thirst

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.030 align:middle line:10%
for oil was doing to
the land and cultures

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.465 align:middle line:10%
of their indigenous neighbors.

00:03:38.465 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And so, the Achuar
made a bold move.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
They reached out to
create a partnership

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.320 align:middle line:84%
with the very world that was
threatening to destroy them.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
MALE NARRATOR: In 1995,
a call issued forth

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
from the heart of the
natural world that was heard

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
thousands of miles
away by a small group

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:90%
of people in the modern world.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:84%
In the summer of that
year in a remote village

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.740 align:middle line:84%
in the rain forest, these
two worlds came together.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And the Pachamama
Alliance was born.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:10%
From the very beginning,
our indigenous partners

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:10%
told us that it was
really, really great

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.649 align:middle line:10%
that we were working
with them in the Amazon,

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.180 align:middle line:10%
shoulder to shoulder.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.450 align:middle line:10%
But that was only
half the battle.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.090 align:middle line:10%
They told us that if we really
wanted to protect their lands

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:10%
permanently, we would
need to go to work

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.110 align:middle line:10%
in our part of the world.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And as they put
it, we would need

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
to change the dream
of the North--

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the dream of the modern world--
a dream rooted in consumption

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and acquisition without any
regard to the consequences

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
to the natural world
or even our own future.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:10%
Changing the dream
of the modern world

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:10%
is certainly a
daunting-- and some would

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:10%
even say an impossible-- task.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.370 align:middle line:10%
But we took the request of
the Achuar very seriously.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:10%
Out of our work
with them, we came

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:10%
to see that we in
the modern world

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:10%
truly are in some kind of a
trance-- living in a dream

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:10%
that's threatening to
destroy not only the rain

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:10%
forest and their way of life
but the health and well-being

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:10%
of our entire planet.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Our society is on a
completely unsustainable path.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And experts
everywhere are saying

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.524 align:middle line:84%
that we have a limited
time to turn things around.

00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:33.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:10%
MALE NARRATOR: So in
response to the requests

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:10%
that came from its
indigenous partners,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:10%
the Pachamama Alliance
created this symposium,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:10%
"Awakening the Dreamer, Changing
the Dream"-- now being offered

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:10%
by thousands of
volunteers in dozens

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.885 align:middle line:10%
of countries around the world.

00:05:46.885 --> 00:05:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.930 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of this symposium
is an audacious one-- bringing

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.290 align:middle line:84%
forth an environmentally
sustainable,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.630 align:middle line:84%
spiritually fulfilling,
socially just

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.465 align:middle line:90%
human presence on this planet.

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle line:10%
FEMALE NARRATOR: The intention
is that by the end-- rather

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:10%
than seeing these as
three separate issues--

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.910 align:middle line:10%
you see them as
interrelated facets of one

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:10%
profoundly
interconnected whole--

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.750 align:middle line:10%
and that you not only
understand the scope and urgency

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:10%
of the planetary
situation we face,

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:10%
but you also see that the
possibility of our times

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.498 align:middle line:10%
is greater than the crisis.

00:06:28.498 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
The goal is that you leave
here in a state that could

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:90%
be described as blessed unrest.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.950 align:middle line:10%
The main purpose of the
"Awakening Dream" or program

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:10%
is to create a cadre
of global citizens

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.410 align:middle line:10%
that are awake-- people who
are engaged in the conversation

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.790 align:middle line:10%
of what's it going to take
to create a new future--

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.840 align:middle line:10%
and that also have the ability
to see that the future is not

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:10%
something that's
just we're going

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.190 align:middle line:10%
to live into but it's something
that we can actually create.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.500 align:middle line:10%
MALE NARRATOR: Indigenous
cultures throughout the world

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.690 align:middle line:10%
have legends and
prophesies that identify

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:10%
this time we are living in as
a turning point for humanity.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.760 align:middle line:84%
One such legend is
found throughout much

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
of the Americas-- the prophecy
of the eagle and the condor.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.680 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE NARRATOR: According
to this prophecy,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
the eagle is the bird that
represents cultures that have

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.650 align:middle line:84%
used the creativity of the
mind and scientific insight

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.310 align:middle line:84%
to harness the
wonders of technology

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and increase material wealth.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
The condor represents
more spiritually-oriented

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
societies-- those that
are deeply in touch

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
with the sacredness
of the natural world

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
of all things.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:10%
This legend said that every
500 years, we go through cycles.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:10%
And the last cycle began
at the end of the 1400s,

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.460 align:middle line:10%
roughly the time of Columbus.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was predicted
that during that cycle,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.460 align:middle line:90%
the eagle would dominate.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But within 500 years, that
cycle would start to change.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
And the eagle and
the condor would

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
fly together in the same skies.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Since the "Awakening
the Dreamer,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Changing the Dream" symposium
was launched in 2005,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.030 align:middle line:84%
it has seen
phenomenal expansions

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:10%
Thousands and thousands of
trained volunteer facilitators

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:10%
are presenting the symposium
in more than 50 countries

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:10%
in more than 10 languages.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, thanks to our partnership
with the people at Gaiam,

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:84%
we are able to bring this
vital message to millions

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:90%
more people worldwide.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.850 align:middle line:84%
This program aims to recreate
the life-changing experience

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
of attending the "Awakening
the Dreamer" symposium.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.500 align:middle line:84%
You'll be seeing an
actual symposium,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:84%
witnessing the
informative presentations,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
watching powerful
videos, and listening in

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:90%
on dynamic group interactions.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Then, you get to interact
with the material, as well.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
From time to time,
I'll be back to guide

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:90%
you through the process.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.130 align:middle line:84%
The symposium
you're about to see

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:84%
was filmed at the Gaiam studios
in Boulder, Colorado, in 2011.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
The participants were
members of the community

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.008 align:middle line:90%
from all walks of life.

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.340 align:middle line:10%
Well, we'd like to
welcome all of you

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle line:10%
to "Awakening the Dreamer,
Changing the Dream" symposium.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:10%
It's just-- we're--
we're totally

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:10%
excited that you're here to
be part of this symposium.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like to start
with just having you learn

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.320 align:middle line:90%
a little bit about who we are.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.310 align:middle line:10%
My name is Doctora Anita
Louisa Theresa Medina Sanchez.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.920 align:middle line:10%
And you can call me Anita.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:84%
But I need to say
all of those names

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:47.820 align:middle line:84%
because that's part
of my ancestry.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
That's part of who--
allowing me to be here now.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And what brings me
such joy of this

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.430 align:middle line:84%
is that it is so connected
up to my purpose.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.810 align:middle line:84%
To be a whole human
being means to really

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
be conscious of my connection
to people, to the earth,

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and to the sacred.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And this has allowed
me to do that.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really, really
pleased to be here

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and to be with you today.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Hm.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.840 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Anita.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:90%
My name is Jon Symes.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:10%
And I started off
as a volunteer,

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.200 align:middle line:10%
like Anita-- although as you
might tell from my accent,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:10%
not in this country.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm born in the UK.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.230 align:middle line:84%
And so for the past
four years, I've

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.080 align:middle line:84%
been involved in the team that's
actually creating this program.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:90%
So I'm no longer a volunteer.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.120 align:middle line:84%
For a couple years, I was
the outreach director.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.670 align:middle line:84%
And I had the huge privilege
of taking this work to places

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:84%
all around the world and
seeing that this work has

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
a way of speaking to
the common interest

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.710 align:middle line:84%
that we have--
that we all share--

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:84%
wherever we are from-- for
a whole and healed world.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.650 align:middle line:90%
I'm just delighted to be here.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Hi to everybody.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, and-- and we're
going to move forward.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's get on
with the symposium.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:90%
And get going.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that you
need to know-- but you would

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:57.400 align:middle line:84%
find out very
quickly-- Jon and I are

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
not experts in all of this
that we're going to deliver.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, probably some of
you know far more than we do.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But we did-- all the
materials that we talk about

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and that are on the
video are the consensus

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.360 align:middle line:84%
of recognized experts
from all over the world.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And we do have materials that we
can send you to on our website

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
so that you can check out any
of this later, if you'd like.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And inside of this
symposium, what we like to do

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
is to acknowledge and
celebrate sacred space--

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and do that by
borrowing the practice

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.440 align:middle line:90%
of our indigenous partners.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we're going to do now.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Often, the toughest journey
in life-- but always the most

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:36.620 align:middle line:84%
rewarding-- is the journey
from the head to the heart

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:37.620 align:middle line:90%
and back again.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's our wish
for you during this day

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and after is many
of those journeys.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And so I invite you-- if
you would lower your eyes

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.160 align:middle line:90%
or close them, if you'd like.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And first, take a deep
breath and let it out.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.180 align:middle line:84%
And as you do,
let go of whatever

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:90%
else you might have been doing.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:84%
Let go of whatever else might
be pulling at your attention

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.546 align:middle line:90%
or awareness now.

00:13:10.546 --> 00:13:12.450 align:middle line:90%
[SOUNDS OF THE RAIN FOREST]

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.690 align:middle line:84%
ANITA SANCHEZ: Take
another deep breath

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and become completely present
to this time and this place

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.558 align:middle line:84%
and this group of
fellow human beings.

00:13:26.558 --> 00:13:34.190 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.280 align:middle line:10%
And begin to envision
and create for ourselves

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:10%
what an environmentally
sustainable,

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:10%
spiritually-fulfilling,
and socially just human

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.522 align:middle line:10%
presence might look like.

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:90%
And you may open your eyes.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.170 align:middle line:84%
So take a breath and bring
your attention back to the front

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:90%
of the room, please.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to share what
amazing times we live in.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And even just following
the news of these days,

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
it's apparent to us that
so much is changing.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the opportunity that we
have right here-- right now--

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.180 align:middle line:84%
is to be part of the gathering
of the collective will

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.420 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And that collective
will is being

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
generated in rooms like
this-- in groups like this

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.190 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the
opportunity we have is

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
to find ourselves as agents of
the development of that will.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Agents of change, we
might say-- people

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
who are willing to step
into an active role

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.010 align:middle line:84%
in creating a new way
of being here today.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
What we're going
to move into now

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:84%
is a process-- just so that
we feel united together

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.120 align:middle line:84%
in the journey
we're going to take,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
we're going to step into
an introduction process.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And Anita's going to
lead us through that.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, let's find
out who's here.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to just talk
with the people at your table.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And there is a set of questions
that, in particular, we

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:55.840 align:middle line:90%
want you to answer.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.900 align:middle line:90%
You're going to say your name.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.630 align:middle line:84%
You're also going to
answer, what do you do

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:90%
or what occupies your time?

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:84%
In addition, you're
going to talk about one--

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
maybe two of the
greatest challenges you

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.250 align:middle line:90%
feel are in the world today.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Fourth, what gives you hope?

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:10%
And fifth, what are
you grateful for?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:15.283 align:middle line:84%
One thing that
you're grateful for.

00:15:15.283 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest challenges,
I think, facing us in the world

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.700 align:middle line:84%
today is how we handle conflicts
safely between nations--

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
so that having so much
power and military

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:90%
is used wisely and responsibly.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel like some of the
biggest problems in the world

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
are at root caused by the
way money is being funneled

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:90%
into a very, very few people.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:84%
What gives me
hope is definitely

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
groups like this--
getting together--

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:53.210 align:middle line:90%
making positive change.

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm just grateful for
the blessed family

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.902 align:middle line:84%
that I'm currently enjoying
in my life right now.

00:15:57.902 --> 00:16:01.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:02.860 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:90%
Now it's your turn.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.850 align:middle line:84%
This is an opportunity for you
to look at where you are now.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Think about these
three questions,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and then write
down your answers.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.270 align:middle line:84%
What do you think are one or
two of the greatest challenges

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:90%
facing the world today?

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.460 align:middle line:10%
What gives you hope?

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.490 align:middle line:10%
What are you grateful for?

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.690 align:middle line:84%
When you're done, come
back to the video.

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:45.067 align:middle line:90%
