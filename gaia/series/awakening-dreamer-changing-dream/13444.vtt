00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Before we end this
section on where are we,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.260 align:middle line:84%
we really want to give
you an opportunity

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.127 align:middle line:90%
to talk with each other.

00:00:07.127 --> 00:00:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But we're going
to ask you to talk

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.210 align:middle line:84%
to each other in
a particular way,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
invite you to really

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.730 align:middle line:84%
talk and go deeper into
sharing what you are feeling.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Not the thoughts, not the how
to fix it, but just stay to what

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.990 align:middle line:90%
is here with you at this time.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.990 align:middle line:84%
Wow, you know,
that's, like, a lot

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to be responsible
for, to feel what's

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.130 align:middle line:90%
actually going on in the world.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.348 align:middle line:84%
Being here is
sparking a passion.

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:41.860 align:middle line:84%
I can feel a fire in my
belly that's like, it's time.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to get
in touch with one word.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I know there are many
feelings, but if you have

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:90%
just one word of a feeling.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And then what I'd
like you to do is

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.380 align:middle line:84%
start over here and just
stand and say that one word

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:90%
and remain standing.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And each person will just say
one word but remain standing.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Would you be willing to begin?
-Truth.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.063 align:middle line:84%
-Pain.
-Depressed.

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.545 align:middle line:90%
Heartbreak.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:13.245 align:middle line:90%
Calling.

00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:15.601 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.300 align:middle line:90%
Shaking.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Courage.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.710 align:middle line:90%
Humanity.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the point of
this, the point of opening

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.240 align:middle line:84%
ourselves up to
these emotions, is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that when we get in touch
with these, our power to act

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:90%
increases.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.900 align:middle line:84%
When we don't feel the
pain, when we don't feel

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.040 align:middle line:84%
the injustice, we're
not very invested

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:90%
in doing anything about it.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
When we allow ourselves to
feel pain and grief, sadness

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and these other emotions,
our desire, our ability,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.705 align:middle line:84%
our impetus to take action
increases enormously.

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think we're ready to move
into the second question now.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:84%
From looking at, where
are we, it's time

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:90%
to look at how we got here.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
important for us is

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to take a moment before
leaping into action

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and look at the real root causes
of some of the dysfunction

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.950 align:middle line:84%
that we've been seeing
in that first section.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Let's examine how it
is that we got here

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.030 align:middle line:84%
before we look at what
possibilities exist

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.426 align:middle line:90%
for action and for change.

00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:23.378 align:middle line:90%

00:02:23.378 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've looked
squarely at where we are,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.010 align:middle line:84%
a good question to
ask might be, how

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
did an intelligent, well-meaning
species who for the most part

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.740 align:middle line:84%
only wanted to make the
world better and more secure

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.370 align:middle line:84%
for their children end
up in such a condition?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
What could possibly
explain how we got

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:90%
into our current predicament?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.495 align:middle line:90%
How did we get here?

00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Someone who looked
deeply at this question

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:84%
was Thomas Berry, a cultural
historian and cosmologist who

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
spent much of his life examining
the relationship between humans

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.965 align:middle line:84%
and the community
of life on Earth.

00:03:05.965 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Berry says that
the primary problem

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:10%
with Western civilization is
that it creates and perpetuates

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.660 align:middle line:10%
a radical separation
between the human world

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:10%
and the natural
world, that we've

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.550 align:middle line:10%
given all the rights to
the human and no rights

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.670 align:middle line:10%
to the natural world.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.470 align:middle line:84%
We think we're behaving
very rationally,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.095 align:middle line:84%
that we're on this kind of
a logical economic course.

00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:54.690 align:middle line:84%
But actually we're heading
toward our destruction,

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:84%
and the only way
to explain it is

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.210 align:middle line:84%
that we've been locked into a
kind of mythic entrancement,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
a worldview that's
become dysfunctional

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and therefore destructive.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.490 align:middle line:84%
According to Thomas
Berry, our industrial age

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:84%
could be characterized
as a period

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
of technological entrancement
in which our obsession

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.670 align:middle line:84%
with progress has us marching
toward an ill-defined, magical

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
paradise somewhere in the
future, a future in which we

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
have mastered the Earth
and everything on it

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.725 align:middle line:90%
without any limits.

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:26.840 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And so it could be said
that we in the modern world

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.570 align:middle line:90%
are living in a kind of trance.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.355 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous people
would call this trance

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:90%
the dream of the modern world.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.070 align:middle line:10%
This dream could also be
called our current worldview,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:10%
a way of seeing the world we're
not even aware that we have.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.990 align:middle line:10%
A worldview is held in
place by a set of beliefs

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.740 align:middle line:10%
and unexamined assumptions that
we're completely unaware of,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.762 align:middle line:10%
like glasses we've worn so
long we don't even know we're

00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:10%
looking through them anymore.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.090 align:middle line:10%
People's actions correlate
with their worldview.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:10%
We take actions consistent
with how we see the world,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:10%
and often those actions
produce outcomes

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:10%
we didn't predict or intend.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:10%
So when our actions produce
outcomes we're not intending,

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:10%
it's important to identify
the unconscious, unexamined

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.490 align:middle line:10%
assumptions that generated those
actions in the first place.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:84%
All the crises
we're facing today

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
can be seen as the
unintended result

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.190 align:middle line:84%
of the unexamined
assumptions that

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:84%
permeate the modern, industrial
society and our own thinking.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at some of
these unexamined assumptions.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:10%
One way to characterize
the cosmology that really is

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.230 align:middle line:10%
at work in our culture is
this, that the natural world,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.180 align:middle line:10%
the Earth, is there for us to
satisfy our needs and desires,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.190 align:middle line:10%
whatever that might be.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:90%
So we want to make things.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.810 align:middle line:84%
We use the Earth.
We make things.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And we think of it as
something like a lumber yard.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we use
the word, resource.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.100 align:middle line:84%
So the Earth is filled with
resources that are there

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.986 align:middle line:90%
for us to use as we see fit.

00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, that orientation
actually is not that bad

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.810 align:middle line:84%
so long as humans are
not that powerful.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But suddenly, when we
become so massively present,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.174 align:middle line:84%
that orientation turns out to
be completely pathological.

00:06:34.174 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
In modern society,
many of us believe

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.890 align:middle line:84%
that our job as
smart shoppers is

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.010 align:middle line:84%
to get the highest level
of comfort and convenience

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:90%
at the lowest possible price.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.380 align:middle line:84%
We assume that when we buy
something, the price we pay

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.710 align:middle line:84%
reflects the full
cost of making it.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:84%
According to Annie Leonard
in "The Story of Stuff,"

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:90%
maybe not.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:10%
I was walking to work, and I
wanted to listen to the news.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:10%
I found this cute, little
green radio for $4.99.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I was standing there in
line to buy this thing,

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking, how
could $4.99 possibly

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:middle line:84%
capture the costs
of making this radio

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:90%
and getting it into my hands?

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:84%
The metal was probably
mined in South Africa.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.750 align:middle line:84%
The petroleum was
probably drilled in Iraq.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.020 align:middle line:84%
The plastics were probably
produced in China.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.260 align:middle line:10%
And maybe the whole thing
was assembled in Mexico.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:84%
$4.99 wouldn't even pay the
rent for the shelf space

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.210 align:middle line:84%
it occupied until I came
along, let alone part

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
of the staff guy's salary
who helped me pick it out

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.900 align:middle line:84%
or the multiple ocean
cruises and truck rides

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.830 align:middle line:90%
pieces of this radio went on.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
That's how I realized I
didn't pay for the radio.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:90%
So who did pay?

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people
paid with the loss

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:90%
of their natural resource base.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.840 align:middle line:84%
These people paid with the
loss of their clean air,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.040 align:middle line:84%
with increasing asthma
and cancer rates.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
All along this system,
people pitched in so I

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:90%
could get this radio for $4.99.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.370 align:middle line:84%
Many people assume
that we can create

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
a healthy society by
concentrating solely

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:90%
on our success as individuals.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.370 align:middle line:90%
We are not just individuals.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:10%
We are part of a society,
a worldwide society.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:10%
We are interdependent,
and that interdependence

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.230 align:middle line:10%
flows at many levels.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.230 align:middle line:90%
It's spiritual.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.296 align:middle line:90%
It is psychological.

00:08:19.296 --> 00:08:21.490 align:middle line:90%
It is economic.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.490 align:middle line:84%
The notion that we can exist
and prosper just individually,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:84%
based purely on what
we do and what we earn,

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:38.150 align:middle line:84%
is a rather new notion in
history, and it doesn't work.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Another prevalent assumption
is that racism is primarily

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
an expression of
personal prejudice

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:84%
and the way individuals
treat each other.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
The effects of
institutionalized racism

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:90%
are harder to see and to change.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Racism has a cost to every
human being on this planet.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
Racism has
dehumanized all of us.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:10%
We are not taught how it was
set up, how it came into being,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:10%
how the very fact
that we have something

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:10%
called race means that
we are ranking people

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:10%
and that we are
giving white people

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.430 align:middle line:10%
more value than everyone else.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Until we understand
the depth of that,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
hard to undo racism.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be hard to change.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:84%
What we try to do is change
people that aren't making it

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.060 align:middle line:84%
in the system
rather than changing

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:34.470 align:middle line:84%
the systems that make sure
that some people don't make it.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.360 align:middle line:10%
We don't just have unexamined
assumptions about how

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:10%
we relate to the planet.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.130 align:middle line:10%
We have underlying
assumptions that we

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.230 align:middle line:10%
haven't examined about how
we relate to each other.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We have a society
that believes that we

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.270 align:middle line:84%
have throwaway resources,
throwaway species,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.880 align:middle line:90%
and throwaway people.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
The same mindset that says
I can ball up this can

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.730 align:middle line:84%
and throw it away,
the same mindset

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.470 align:middle line:84%
says, I can ball up this
child and throw that child

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:84%
into a prison
forever for a mistake

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.690 align:middle line:84%
that that child made,
similar to a mistake

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.620 align:middle line:84%
my child might be making
with drugs or whatever.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the core mindset.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
When you say you're going
to throw something away,

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.190 align:middle line:90%
where is away?

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.920 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.130 align:middle line:10%
And where away actually is
is social justice issues and

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:10%
environmental justice issues.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.200 align:middle line:84%
Every plastic bag, plastic
cup, plastic to-go container,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:84%
that is the petroleum
complex in Africa,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Ecuador, Columbia, Alaska.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.600 align:middle line:90%
You name it.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.110 align:middle line:84%
Every paper bag, paper plate,
paper napkin, that is a forest.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything that is called
waste or disposable

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.130 align:middle line:84%
is the ways in
which we are saying

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that it is acceptable to throw
our planet and its people away.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Disposables are one of the huge
magnifiers of how we've lost

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.415 align:middle line:90%
our connection to the sacred.

00:11:15.415 --> 00:11:18.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Just take it for granted that
we're going to go to the coffee

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.940 align:middle line:84%
shop and get coffee that came
from an exploited community

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.410 align:middle line:84%
somewhere where a forest was
destroyed for a monoculture.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Put it in a paper cup
that used to be a forest.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Put a plastic lid
on top of it that

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.670 align:middle line:84%
used to be an
indigenous community

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:90%
somewhere in a beautiful area.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Drink it, and then
throw it away where

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
it goes back and
pollutes a nature

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
community or a human
community at the end.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
I am so fiercely
passionate about it

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
because I know in my heart
that as long as we are trashing

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the planet and
trashing each other,

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:56.280 align:middle line:84%
a healthy and holistic and
healed world is not possible.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.510 align:middle line:84%
We cannot have peace
on the Earth unless we

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:90%
also have peace with the Earth.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:84%
The dream of the modern world
is constructed almost entirely

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
out of assumptions
that have simply

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:90%
been accepted for generations.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Questioning these
assumptions is a powerful way

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:84%
to begin to awaken from
our collective trance.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to share some of
the unexamined assumptions

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:84%
that we found in our
own lives as we've

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:90%
become engaged in this work.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I, for instance, know that an
unexamined assumption that I

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.950 align:middle line:84%
was working with for a
long time was that if I can

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.270 align:middle line:84%
afford to buy
something, then I should

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:90%
just go ahead and do that.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.960 align:middle line:84%
Linked to that
was the assumption

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
that whatever I chose to do
was free of adverse affect

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.250 align:middle line:90%
on other people.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.210 align:middle line:84%
One of them that comes up
for me is that if I work hard

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a positive thinker,
I'll somehow not have

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.180 align:middle line:90%
to deal with racism and sexism.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.330 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
another prevalent

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:84%
assumption that opportunity
exists for everybody.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't get
ahead, it's probably

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.230 align:middle line:84%
because we haven't worked hard
enough or tried hard enough.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Or we're not smart enough.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
So we'd actually like to
give you an opportunity

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to look and see some of the
assumptions that are playing

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:84%
out in your own lives, the
assumptions that maybe exist

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:84%
in your thinking that you
haven't previously looked at

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.100 align:middle line:84%
but are the assumptions that are
leading you into-- particularly

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.430 align:middle line:84%
these-- the assumptions that
lead you into behaviors you

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
don't want,
behaviors that aren't

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
consistent with a
sustainable and a just

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.830 align:middle line:90%
and a fulfilling future.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So really, in conversation,
what can you find?

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.010 align:middle line:84%
What are the
unexamined assumptions

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.450 align:middle line:84%
that now you can
become aware of that

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.820 align:middle line:84%
are driving our behavior here
together in the modern world?

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
One assumption
is the expectation

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that government and leaders
will take care of the problems

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're witnessing
and learning about here.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And another one is
just kind of as adults

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that we are defined by
what we do in the world,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.230 align:middle line:84%
especially on a
professional level.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:84%
One of them was we think
we are doing something,

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
but we are not
doing nearly enough.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:21.412 align:middle line:84%
And another one is also science
and technology will save us.

00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:23.740 align:middle line:84%
Are two unexamined
assumptions were

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a separate
individual, that, like, we're

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:90%
somehow not connected.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And our other one was
that we can conquer life,

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:90%
that we can master our domain.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:90%


00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
This distinction of
unconscious, unexamined

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:84%
assumptions, for me,
is really the most

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.560 align:middle line:90%
powerful part of the symposium.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Every time I start
thinking about it,

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I discover yet another
unexamined assumption

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.570 align:middle line:90%
that's got hold of me.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And what I love about it is
that when you identify them,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:84%
they begin to lose
their grip on your life.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
We're caught in unconscious,
unexamined assumptions.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:90%
More is better.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.140 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough to go around.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.030 align:middle line:90%
If you read it, it's true.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
make a difference.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:06.420 align:middle line:90%
It's too big.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.230 align:middle line:84%
All of these unconscious,
unexamined assumptions

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:84%
kind of paralyze us and keep
us from making a difference

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:84%
with our life, really
getting into action,

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.890 align:middle line:84%
really knowing that
we matter and that we

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:90%
can change the world.

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:84%
See if you can identify
some unexamined assumptions

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.880 align:middle line:90%
of your own.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.750 align:middle line:10%
Look in several areas--
your beliefs about the world

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:10%
around you, about other people,
about yourself, about purpose

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.380 align:middle line:10%
and meaning in life.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And when you've written down
several unexamined assumptions,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.770 align:middle line:90%
come on back.
