00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.740 align:middle line:10%
And it's time now to move
to the third question.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.720 align:middle line:10%
And what's just so exciting
is that the change that we're

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.820 align:middle line:10%
talking about is not some
anticipated phenomenon

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.150 align:middle line:10%
in the world, but it's
actually happening now.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So the third question
is, what's emerging?

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And to ground ourselves
and what's emerging,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.290 align:middle line:84%
it's also useful to look
at the context of history.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And if we look back over
the sweep of history,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.190 align:middle line:84%
we see that there
have been periods when

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.189 align:middle line:84%
particular ways of being
or particular empires,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.220 align:middle line:84%
particular established orders
have seemed immutable, seemed

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.090 align:middle line:84%
immovable, seemed
stuck, and you couldn't

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.490 align:middle line:84%
imagine that the situation
of the moment could change.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.030 align:middle line:84%
But actually, we've had
some fantastic examples

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
of the complete
overthrow of what

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:90%
seemed like a permanent order.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think of the
think of the time

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.120 align:middle line:84%
when Gandhi and the Indians
threw the British out of India.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I think about that.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.845 align:middle line:84%
I think about the overthrow
of the Berlin Wall.

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And I bet you could think
of some other examples

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.945 align:middle line:84%
where things that seemed like
they would never shift, did so.

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder if anybody can
think of examples right now.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:84%
Currently, with the
Egyptian revolution

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:90%
and the Arab Awakening.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:90%
The election of Barack Obama.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.360 align:middle line:84%
The food movement
that's emerging,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.349 align:middle line:84%
as least that I've notice
in this country and others.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.515 align:middle line:84%
There's the grassroots
organization

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
of people going
back to the earth

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and growing their own
food, which is huge.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Whole cities and city
councils are getting very much

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.630 align:middle line:84%
behind complete
recycling programs

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.960 align:middle line:90%
as they are here in Boulder.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.640 align:middle line:84%
The whole shift in
the automotive industry

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and in the trucking industry
with Smith Electric, Ford,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Tesla moving towards
electric and hybrid vehicles.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.170 align:middle line:84%
The incredible creation
of new kinds of technology

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
to create energy from clean
sources and in clean ways.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.160 align:middle line:84%
The V-Day movement,
which is designed

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.560 align:middle line:84%
to end violence against
women and girls globally.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Social media--
it's allowing people

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
that didn't think
their one voice

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.704 align:middle line:90%
counted to assemble in groups.

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:06.700 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it's all emerging.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it's really
rapid and exciting.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Now that we understand how
profoundly connected everything

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.820 align:middle line:84%
is, we're going to look at
what that makes possible

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.420 align:middle line:90%
and what is emerging now.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The emergence of
a new dream isn't

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
something that's going
to happen in the future;

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.040 align:middle line:90%
it's already happening.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.740 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're living
in what some people would call

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.100 align:middle line:84%
the "great turning,"
the "great transition,"

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:90%
or the "turning of the tide."

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, it's happening
now, and you're part of it.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.937 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:42.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.590 align:middle line:84%
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR:
Let us remember that there

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
is a creative for us in
this universe of power that

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
is able to make a
way out of no way

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.970 align:middle line:84%
and transform dark yesterdays
into bright tomorrows.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:10%
Let us realize that arc of
the moral universe is long,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.135 align:middle line:10%
but it bends toward justice.

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:17.750 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:10%
There is a tendency
to think that what

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:10%
we see in the present
moment will continue.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:10%
We forget how often
we've been astonished

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.335 align:middle line:10%
by the sudden crumbling
of institutions,

00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:34.430 align:middle line:10%
by extraordinary changes
in people's thoughts,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.900 align:middle line:10%
by unexpected eruptions of
rebellion against tyrannies,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.510 align:middle line:10%
by the quick collapse
of systems of power

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:10%
that seemed invincible.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.940 align:middle line:84%
What leaps out from the
history of the past 100 years

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.230 align:middle line:90%
is it's utter unpredictability.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:10%
Demonstrations in Russia
were totally illegal.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:10%
After one second holding
the banner in front of you,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:10%
you would be arrested.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:10%
But we did it once,
and we did it twice,

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:10%
and then we do the three times.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And a year later demonstrations
were a common thing

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.370 align:middle line:90%
on the streets of Moscow.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't believe that
we can change anything,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:90%
but we did it anyway.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:84%
After many centuries
of warfare in Europe,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
you could have
imagined the emergence

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of a political
and economic power

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:90%
that is now the European Union?

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And in a country with a history
of slavery and segregation,

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
who could have predicted
that a man of color

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.280 align:middle line:90%
would be elected its president?

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Or that a nation would
publicly apologize

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.570 align:middle line:84%
for the wrongs committed
against its first peoples?

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.280 align:middle line:10%
We apologize for
the laws and policies

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.650 align:middle line:10%
of successive parliaments
and governments

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.660 align:middle line:10%
that have inflicted
profound grief, suffering,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:10%
and loss on these, our
fellow Australians.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
For the pain, suffering and hurt
of these stolen generations,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.150 align:middle line:90%
we say, sorry.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.030 align:middle line:10%
Many, many years ago I
interviewed Desmond Tutu

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:10%
prior to the end of apartheid.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying,
"when we end apartheid."

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And I kept thinking, yeah,
right, like dream on.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't want to rain
on his parade or anything,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:84%
but in my heart of hearts I
thought, not in your lifetime.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, a year and
a half later, it was over.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:10%
So it was a really profound
lesson about what can happen

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:10%
when the will of people aligns.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:50.440 align:middle line:84%
We have defeated awful things
like Nazism, like apartheid.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen some wonderful
human beings-- Mahatma Gandhi,

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:90%
the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:10%
What that says is that
ultimately good prevails.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:10%
It is a moral universe,
despite all appearances

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.550 align:middle line:10%
to the contrary.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It is that
there's no way in which

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:90%
evil will ultimately triumph.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Many experts are convinced
that humanity already possesses

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.690 align:middle line:84%
the resources and
technology to solve

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
our most pressing environmental
and social problems.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:10%
We know how to do these things.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:10%
This is not a great mystery.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to do research
for the next 20 years

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:10%
to figure out what to do.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.840 align:middle line:90%
We know what to do.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.630 align:middle line:84%
We think it'll take
about $200 billion a year

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize population,
eradicate poverty,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and restore the
economy's natural support

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.120 align:middle line:90%
systems over the next decade.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:10%
But when you compare it
with military budgets,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:10%
it's really not that much.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:10%
It is less than a third
of the US military budget.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:10%
It is roughly an eighth of
the global military budget.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:10%
So we can't say we
don't have the resources

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.416 align:middle line:10%
to save civilization.

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.690 align:middle line:84%
The ideas, technologies,
and policies

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that will lead to a
new future are already

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
emerging in government,
business, and civil society,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:84%
as well as in people's personal
lives throughout the world.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.000 align:middle line:90%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:48.440 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:84%
The United Nations'
Millennium Development Goals

00:07:51.540 --> 00:08:01.480 align:middle line:84%
represent a worldwide effort to
end hunger and poverty by 2015.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:10%
Businesses and
corporations are recognizing

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:10%
that success in the
21st century means

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.620 align:middle line:10%
paying attention to the
triple bottom line--

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:10%
people, planet, and profit.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:10%
The world's largest
corporation has announced

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:10%
aspirational goals to be 100%
renewable energy, zero waste,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.500 align:middle line:10%
and sell only
sustainable products.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.930 align:middle line:84%
60,000 to 90,000 companies
that sell products to Walmart

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:84%
will now have to
show that they are

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
measuring and tracking
their carbon footprint

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:90%
and beginning to reduce it.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
the trash is inevitable.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It's one of those
necessary evils of life.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:40.210 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:10%
Waste is actually the
product of bad design,

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:10%
and bad design can be changed.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:55.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Innovative design is also
creating low-tech solutions

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.940 align:middle line:90%
for the developing world.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.220 align:middle line:84%
At the heart of the
transition to a new world

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.200 align:middle line:84%
are the communities,
families, and individuals who

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:84%
are changing the way they are
living, making new choices

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.800 align:middle line:84%
based on the values that support
a more sustainable, just,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.172 align:middle line:90%
and fulfilling society.

00:09:20.172 --> 00:09:21.990 align:middle line:10%
When we think about
global warming,

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.910 align:middle line:10%
we think about
transportation, we

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.750 align:middle line:10%
think about we heat our houses.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, how we
eat has just as big

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:29.642 align:middle line:90%
an impact on climate change.

00:09:29.642 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere on planet
Earth in cities and towns,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
suburbs and villages, a vast and
unprecedented global phenomenon

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.700 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to
make itself known.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:10%
There is another
superpower here on Earth

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:10%
that is an unnamed movement.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:10%
It is far different and bigger
and more unique than anything

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:10%
we have ever seen.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It flies under the radar
of the media, by and large.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It is nonviolent.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It is grassroots.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
It has no cluster bombs, no
armies, and no helicopters.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.250 align:middle line:90%
It has no central ideology.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.590 align:middle line:84%
A male vertebrate
is not in charge.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.530 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
This unnamed movement--
you can clap for that.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:10%
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
The very word "movement" is
too small to describe it.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:35.110 align:middle line:84%
This is humanity's immune
response to resist and heal

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
political disease,
economic infection,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and ecological corruption
caused by ideologies.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.250 align:middle line:84%
This is fundamentally a
civil rights movement,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:90%
a human rights movement.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:90%
This is a democracy movement.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:90%
It is the coming world.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
What you're seeing
here is the beginning

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.040 align:middle line:84%
of a list of the two million
organizations in the world that

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.913 align:middle line:84%
did work toward social
and environmental justice,

00:11:02.913 --> 00:11:03.612 align:middle line:90%
and that's a minimum.

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.020 align:middle line:10%
To give you a sense of how big
this movement is, if I start

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:10%
this tape today at 9:00 AM
and we watch this all day

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.650 align:middle line:10%
and all night and
the day after that,

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:10%
and then we watch it
for three more weeks

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.580 align:middle line:10%
and then another
month after that,

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:10%
we still would not
have seen the names

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.165 align:middle line:10%
of all the groups in the world.

00:11:27.165 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.021 align:middle line:84%
It's the largest social movement
in the history of human kind,

00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:90%
by far.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.350 align:middle line:84%
Powering this growing
global phenomenon

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.750 align:middle line:84%
is the explosive
digital revolution

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.790 align:middle line:84%
that is revealing and connecting
a planetary human community.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.355 align:middle line:10%
People can now be
connected nationwide

00:12:07.355 --> 00:12:09.740 align:middle line:10%
to act locally in
their communities

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.890 align:middle line:10%
and then have all that local
action united into one,

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:10%
synchronized, beautiful,
harmonic voice.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.790 align:middle line:10%
The only voice we have
it this video editing.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:10%
We don't know books,
so we can't write much.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.070 align:middle line:10%
But if we are able to do a
small film of what is happening

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:10%
to us, it will go the
internet and the whole world

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:10%
will see it.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.820 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
We have the technologies,
policies, and initiatives

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to move us toward
a thriving future.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.994 align:middle line:84%
All that's missing is something
that only human beings can

00:12:44.994 --> 00:12:47.250 align:middle line:84%
provide-- the commitment,
the collective

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.660 align:middle line:90%
will to change our direction.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Awake committed people
are galvanizing that will

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.647 align:middle line:84%
and becoming who they need to
be to make it happen together.

00:12:55.647 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is just a
tiny fraction of what's

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:90%
happening around the world.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:11.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just such an exciting
time for us to be alive.

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And some people say that
inside of a commitment

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.910 align:middle line:84%
to work for a world
that works maybe

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.730 align:middle line:84%
the biggest crisis
we have is a crisis

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.050 align:middle line:90%
of imagination and creativity.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And given our commitment with
creativity, with inspiration,

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
we can fashion all
of the solutions

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that we can see that
we can contribute to.

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:90%
It's just an amazing time here.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're going to do
is offer us all an opportunity

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
to use our vision
and our creativity

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.190 align:middle line:90%
in imagining a future.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
What's exciting-- this is
another thing that's emerging--

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.220 align:middle line:84%
is we know far much more
about how our brain operates.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And even though our elders had
been telling us for some time,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle line:90%
watch what you think.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Watch the images you put out.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
The reality is the
body mind connection,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.680 align:middle line:90%
we're propelled there.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.040 align:middle line:84%
So we want to take
a few moments right

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
now to give you
some time to drop

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:90%
in to do a little visioning.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Now please settle
back into your chair

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and allow your eyes to
lower or gently close.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Take a breath in and let it out.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Now go out way into the
future, perhaps 40 or 50 years

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
from now, and see a world
where the environment is

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:35.560 align:middle line:84%
healthy and thriving,
where people are

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:44.040 align:middle line:84%
fulfilled and happy,
where society is just,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.595 align:middle line:84%
fair, and equitable
for everyone.

00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.010 align:middle line:90%
Look around you.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.190 align:middle line:84%
What does an
environmentally sustainable,

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.320 align:middle line:84%
spiritually fulfilling,
and socially justice

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.613 align:middle line:90%
human presence look like?

00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Now see yourself
sitting in a circle with

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.705 align:middle line:90%
your great-great-grandchildren.

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Or if you don't have children,
the great-great-grandchildren

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:90%
of children you know and love.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting on
a grassy knoll.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And as you look around, you see
a variety of different cultures

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and skin color as these
beautiful children ask you,

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
what was it like for you when
the world was in crisis way

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:84%
back when the Earth's
ecosystems were unraveling,

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
when there was so much inequity
and injustice and oppression

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:84%
still affecting so
many people's lives

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
and there was starvation
and war in the human family?

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Now allow these children and
the great-great-grandchildren

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.825 align:middle line:84%
of all species to thank you,
appreciate you, and acknowledge

00:16:11.825 --> 00:16:16.740 align:middle line:84%
you for playing a role
in the "great turning"

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.956 align:middle line:84%
and for seizing the opportunity
and not going back to sleep.

00:16:20.956 --> 00:16:23.320 align:middle line:90%
Let them thank you.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.528 align:middle line:90%
Let them embrace you.

00:16:24.528 --> 00:16:36.240 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Please take a breath and
then gently open your eyes.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:46.190 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back to the room.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I can always feel that
outpouring of imagination

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and creativity, and
I wonder if there

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.490 align:middle line:84%
are a couple of people who
have a vision they'd like

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:90%
to share with the rest of us.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.760 align:middle line:84%
I saw a moments
in future where I

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.390 align:middle line:84%
was surrounded by my
descendants, and they said,

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:90%
what was the big change?

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And I said, there came a moment
when almost everyone started

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.470 align:middle line:84%
cooperating for what
needed to happen,

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:23.294 align:middle line:84%
and they stopped cooperating
for what shouldn't be happening.

00:17:23.294 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:90%
