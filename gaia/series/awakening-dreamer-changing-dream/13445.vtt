00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.527 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.527 --> 00:00:02.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, everybody.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.734 align:middle line:84%
So let's move and
look at the purpose.

00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the
Awakening the Dreamer,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Changing the Dream Symposium,
which is on the screen now,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.840 align:middle line:84%
is bringing forth an
environmentally-sustainable,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.370 align:middle line:84%
spiritually-fulfilling,
socially-just human presence

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.160 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And now when you look at this
and that we're committed to all

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.080 align:middle line:84%
of those, it may at
first seem like these

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.720 align:middle line:90%
are three separate issues.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But what I think that
you'll come to understand

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 align:middle line:90%
is that they are not separate.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
They are actually
intricately interwoven.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:90%
They're part of a whole.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.310 align:middle line:84%
And what you'll find
is that there's no way

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.700 align:middle line:84%
to be able to sustain
any kind of progress

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:84%
if you only focus on one
and ignore the other two.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:90%
So they are very much connected.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And we know that by
the end of the day,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
by the end of this symposium,
you'll be even more deeply

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:90%
aware of that connection.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think we understand
that some of you

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.970 align:middle line:84%
have been committed in
action in these areas

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
for a long, long time,
and we acknowledge

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:90%
that and thank you for that.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
And in that context, maybe today
will occur as an opportunity

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
to deepen your understanding,
explore some new perspectives,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps expand
and strengthen

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.940 align:middle line:84%
your own commitment to what
you're already engaged in.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And so how we are going
to go through these,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:84%
the flow of the symposium, is
through a series of questions.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.650 align:middle line:84%
So the first question
is, where are we?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Given that we're bringing forth
an environmentally-sustainable,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:84%
spiritually-fulfilling, and
socially-just human presence,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
where are we are in relationship
to each of those areas?

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is very important that
we have some shared knowledge

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.780 align:middle line:84%
about that because that
will be a foundation

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.510 align:middle line:90%
piece for our work together.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the second question
is, how did we get here?

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very,
very important question

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
because rather than--
generally after we

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
hear where we are
in any problems,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.170 align:middle line:84%
the natural instinct
is to run to fix it.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.820 align:middle line:84%
But we need to slow
down and figure

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:90%
out, how did we get here?

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.830 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have a
special kind of analysis

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:84%
that we'll get to be
involved in to look at,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.740 align:middle line:90%
what is the root cause?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Not just the
superficial behavior,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:84%
but what is really
underneath this, so

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.960 align:middle line:90%
that we can make other choices?

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the third question
is, what is emerging now?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.990 align:middle line:90%
What is happening?

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.455 align:middle line:90%
What is possible?

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
Not only what is possible, what
is already emerging through us,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.380 align:middle line:90%
around us, throughout the world?

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth
and final question

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.770 align:middle line:90%
is, where do we go from here?

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And probably this question
is the most important

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.000 align:middle line:84%
of all because then we're asking
ourselves, what are you to do?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.330 align:middle line:90%
What are you to be?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.730 align:middle line:84%
How do you fit into
what is happening?

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.070 align:middle line:84%
And what are the actions
that we need to take

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:90%
to create the new dream?

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, so let's start
with the first question.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And the first question
is, where are we?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And we'll examine where we are
together at this moment in time

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
through the three lenses of
the environment, of society,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and our own personal
and spiritual concern.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
This is not meant to
be new information.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I think most of us have heard
a lot of this information.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And what too often
happens, though,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
if we've heard a lot
of this information,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.270 align:middle line:84%
we can actually
become numb to it.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.740 align:middle line:84%
As you watch this video
about where we are now,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
I invite you to let
it all in deeply

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and listen with your heart
as well as your mind.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
Letting in the scope and impact
of our current global crisis

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:84%
can be disturbing, and it takes
courage to face the reality

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:90%
of our present situation.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.370 align:middle line:84%
But it's important
to let yourself feel

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and not distance
yourself from it.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.540 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Given that our purpose
is bringing forth

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.420 align:middle line:84%
an environmentally-sustainable,
spiritually-fulfilling,

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
and socially-just
just human presence

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
on this planet, the
first question to ask

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:90%
is, where are we?

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:10%
In other words, what kind of
world is our modern way of life

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.660 align:middle line:10%
actually producing?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.620 align:middle line:84%
Answering that question and
confronting the realities

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:84%
it reveals may not be
comfortable, but as we'll see,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:84%
it is an essential
first step to revealing

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:84%
what may be the
greatest opportunity

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:90%
any generation has ever faced.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
One place to begin is with
the dramatic changes that have

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.698 align:middle line:90%
occurred in human population.

00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of years,
human population on Earth

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:90%
remained relatively steady.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.410 align:middle line:10%
Then about 200 years ago, at
the time of the Industrial

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:10%
Revolution, humans
learned how to harness

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:10%
the energy of fossil fuels.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:10%
That allowed
agricultural productivity

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:10%
to increase dramatically,
and human population

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.735 align:middle line:10%
began to grow exponentially.

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Since then, we in
the modern world

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
have attempted to meet
our needs and wants

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:84%
through an
ever-expanding process

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.010 align:middle line:84%
of extraction, production,
consumption, and disposal

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.935 align:middle line:90%
of natural resources.

00:05:16.935 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:10%
Gross Domestic Product,
GDP, is supposed

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:10%
to be a measure of everything.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:84%
It puts a value on
everything that's

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.330 align:middle line:84%
been produced in an economy
within a year's time.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
But what that doesn't
measure is the fact

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
that in order to achieve
that gross domestic product,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.460 align:middle line:84%
there's also a lot of
destruction of natural wealth.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And one can in fact say that
the greater the GDP of a country

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
is, measured
conventionally, the more

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:84%
natural wealth
either in that place

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:90%
or globally has been destroyed.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
This current industrial
model requires

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:90%
continuous economic growth.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.760 align:middle line:90%
But is that growth sustainable?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
According to the United
Nations, sustainability

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.540 align:middle line:84%
is the ability of the
current generation

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:84%
to meet its needs
without compromising

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.840 align:middle line:84%
the ability of future
generations to meet theirs.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.040 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, the
mass-consumption dream

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.260 align:middle line:84%
of the modern world
has been a nightmare

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:90%
for the global environment.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.480 align:middle line:10%
The Earth's forests
are shrinking.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:10%
Soils are eroding.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:10%
Water tables are
falling as a result

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:10%
of over pumping of aquifers.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:10%
Fisheries are collapsing.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Grasslands are
turning into desert

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.845 align:middle line:90%
as a result of overgrazing.

00:06:44.845 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
No civilization
has ever survived

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
the ongoing destruction of
its natural support systems,

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.910 align:middle line:90%
nor will ours.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the world is
rapidly approaching a number

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of tipping points, thresholds
beyond which dangerous trends

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
will become irreversible,
threatening the existence

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:90%
of life as we know it.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.270 align:middle line:10%
One such tipping
point is the end

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:10%
of cheap, plentiful petroleum,
what is known as peak oil.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle line:10%
The academic researchers,
who are much more likely to be

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.160 align:middle line:10%
independent and hard
headed in their analysis

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.850 align:middle line:10%
outside the oil
industry, believe

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:41.640 align:middle line:10%
that peak oil probably in
the area of 2010, 2015,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.620 align:middle line:10%
something like that.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And after that, we begin to
see a reduction in the supply,

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.460 align:middle line:90%
but an acceleration of demand.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It is impossible to believe
that will not happen.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:90%
It is going to happen.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:10%
Humanity has been continuously
increasing its resource demand

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:10%
to the extent that
by the mid '80s,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.870 align:middle line:10%
we've started to use more than
what nature can regenerate.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And by 2007, humanity
used about 30%

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:90%
more than what nature can renew.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have been in
global overshoot.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:10%
Overshoot can be thought of as
living off of your credit card.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:10%
You know, humanity is living
off its ecological credit card.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:84%
If we use more than
nature can keep up with,

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
we actually start to
erode natural capital

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.390 align:middle line:90%
that life depends on.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Currently, if everyone on Earth
lived as North Americans do,

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:90%
we'd need five Earths.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.090 align:middle line:84%
For everyone to
live as Europeans do

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:90%
would take three Earths.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
In other regions, people are
living beyond the capacity

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:90%
of one Earth as well.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.970 align:middle line:10%
China and India are
presently living just

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:10%
under the one-Earth
level, but given

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.600 align:middle line:10%
the rapid industrialization
and economic growth

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.545 align:middle line:10%
of both countries,
that's sure to change.

00:09:04.545 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.910 align:middle line:10%
We are fast approaching
a number of tipping points

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:10%
related to the increase
of carbon dioxide

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:10%
in the Earth's atmosphere
caused primarily

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.425 align:middle line:10%
by the burning of fossil fuels.

00:09:29.425 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.790 align:middle line:10%
The scientists around the
world have come together

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.020 align:middle line:10%
to tell us that climate
change is actually

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.940 align:middle line:10%
happening at a much
faster rate than they

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:10%
had first anticipated.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:84%
The signs of this are
the cataclysmic storms,

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:90%
the extremes in weather.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The polar ice caps
are melting, and it

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.635 align:middle line:84%
means that the entire
ecosystem is in peril.

00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:56.740 align:middle line:90%


00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.780 align:middle line:10%
Tipping point means, in the
context of climate change,

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:10%
that after a certain temperature
rise and certain other impacts

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:10%
on the global ecosystem,
certain things change

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.490 align:middle line:10%
that cannot be moved back.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.370 align:middle line:84%
If the glaciers
disappear, then they

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
will no longer be able to
supply the lakes and the rivers.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.140 align:middle line:84%
As they are melting, you have
more water around, flooding,

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and lakes are full.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:84%
But once they disappear,
then that's it.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.430 align:middle line:90%
Then there is no more.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.360 align:middle line:84%
While people are becoming
increasingly aware

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
of the effects of
climate change, what's

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.525 align:middle line:84%
not as well known is the impact
we are having on other species.

00:10:38.525 --> 00:10:41.330 align:middle line:90%


00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.580 align:middle line:10%
We are in the midst
of a mass extinction,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:10%
but the news has not
reached the general public.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
They are utterly
unaware that the sacred

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
and talismanic and
heart-breakingly-loved

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
companions of ours on this Earth
are about to disappear forever.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.990 align:middle line:90%
They will not return.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.470 align:middle line:84%
African lions are on the
absolute verge of extinction.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:17.180 align:middle line:90%
There are only 20,000 left.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:21.970 align:middle line:84%
That's down 90% in
the past few decades.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Every species and subspecies
of tiger on the planet

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:84%
is on the absolute
verge of extinction.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Elephants down 90% in the past
century, 90% of all large fish

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.420 align:middle line:90%
are gone from the oceans.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Half of all species of life
may be extinct in 50 years.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:10%
Nothing this destructive has
happened in 65 million years.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.985 align:middle line:10%
Why is that not our
central concern?

00:11:53.985 --> 00:11:56.830 align:middle line:90%


00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It's overwhelming.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.780 align:middle line:90%
No one imagined it could happen.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, we're
confronted with this fact,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and we don't really know
how to respond to it.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:10%
I think that's beyond most of
us because we haven't deepened

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:10%
our hearts in a way that would
make possible the grief that

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:39.220 align:middle line:10%
is wanting to be felt.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.208 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:42.690 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So I invite you
to take a breath.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.082 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.082 --> 00:12:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And very often, we run
from information like this

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:84%
or start to think
about what we could do,

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:90%
analyze the situation.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
But I invite you right now just
to check in with how you feel

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.302 align:middle line:84%
and pay attention to
how you feel confronted

00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:01.035 align:middle line:90%
with that information.

00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:06.210 align:middle line:90%
Take a moment with that.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.470 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes if that helps.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And as you come back to
the front of the room,

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:84%
know that we'll find a way of
turning our emotion about this

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.430 align:middle line:90%
into an impulse for action.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.920 align:middle line:84%
We're going to move
on and start to look

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.320 align:middle line:84%
at the second of
the three lenses

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.990 align:middle line:84%
and ask ourselves the question
of where are we in relation

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to the creation of a
socially-just world?

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And what is a socially-just
world, anyway?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a socially-just world
is a world in which everybody

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.040 align:middle line:84%
is treated equally,
everybody has a voice,

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:54.490 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps where everybody has
equal access to the resources

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:90%
that we have in society.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's a world in which the
differences of race or class,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
age, gender, sexual
orientation, physical ability

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.550 align:middle line:90%
no longer separate us.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And to move to a place
beyond that separation,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.120 align:middle line:84%
to move to a place
where we recognize

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.350 align:middle line:84%
and even celebrate
our diversity,

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we need to look at the
legacy of hundreds of years

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:84%
of oppression that still
exists with us today

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.110 align:middle line:84%
and also look at and
see how the playing

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.180 align:middle line:84%
field is still tilted
in favor of some of us

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:90%
at the expense of others.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.130 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the impact that
the dream of the modern world

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.490 align:middle line:84%
is having on the environment
and other species.

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.805 align:middle line:84%
But how is it affecting
the human family?

00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary
expectations people

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.110 align:middle line:84%
have of the modern
industrial system

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
has been that by
growing the economy,

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.190 align:middle line:84%
life will get
better for everyone,

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.360 align:middle line:84%
that we are continually
moving toward a more

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:90%
socially-just world.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:90%
But is this true?

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.580 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up, I
always thought that, of course,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.590 align:middle line:84%
the world will
become more equal.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:10%
There will be more
people educated.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.360 align:middle line:10%
People will get jobs, and, you
know, we'll all be better off.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:10%
We'll all be more prosperous.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.260 align:middle line:84%
However, what has that happened
in the last 20 years or so is

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.930 align:middle line:84%
the world has
become more unequal.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:84%
This idea that the poor will be
kind of helped to come along,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.390 align:middle line:84%
even though the rich
get richer, this hasn't

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.240 align:middle line:90%
actually worked out to be true.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.480 align:middle line:84%
We all know that a
great disparity currently

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:90%
exists between rich and poor.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
One way to understand
this disparity

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.850 align:middle line:84%
is to think of the Earth as
a community of 100 people.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:16:59.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.610 align:middle line:10%
Although significant progress
has been made in addressing

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:10%
issues of social justice,
systems of power and privilege

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.950 align:middle line:10%
still perpetuate injustice
throughout the world.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.069 align:middle line:84%
Much of humanity
continues to suffer

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.800 align:middle line:84%
from the legacy of
centuries of colonialism,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.107 align:middle line:90%
imperialism, and racism.

00:17:18.107 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:10%
A socially-just
world is a world

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:10%
in which if you
had to draw a lot

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.470 align:middle line:10%
and it would put you
anywhere in that society,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.710 align:middle line:10%
you would feel
perfectly confident.

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't be worried because
you knew whatever lot you drew

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:90%
would be a good lot.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
everything is equal.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It just means that every
single person in that society

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
has a decent shot at living
the fullest life that they can.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.556 align:middle line:10%
But if you close your eyes
and you to think yourself,

00:17:50.556 --> 00:17:53.920 align:middle line:10%
you know, there's no more
racism, all this racism stuff,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.340 align:middle line:10%
that's in the past, close yours
eyes and think to yourself,

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.440 align:middle line:10%
would you want to be black?

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.600 align:middle line:90%
Would you trade places?

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you wouldn't
trade places,

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:90%
then there's work to be done.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:84%
People around the
world are starting

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to realize that climate
disruption, pollution,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and other environmental
problems will soon have

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:90%
an impact on the way they live.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But for millions of
others, it already has.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
The movement to address this has
a name, environmental justice.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.250 align:middle line:10%
Environmental
justice is the belief

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.180 align:middle line:10%
that no community
should have to bear

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:10%
the brunt of a disproportionate
amount of environmental burdens

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:10%
and not enjoy any
environmental benefits.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And around the world, that
is something that you see.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:84%
In many parts of the world,
especially once colonized

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
countries where
local people still

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.140 align:middle line:84%
have no control over
their natural resources,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the industrial world's demand
for oil, minerals, and timber

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:84%
is having devastating
effects on the land, air,

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:90%
water, and people.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.150 align:middle line:84%
An example is the Niger Delta
of Nigeria, where hundreds

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.530 align:middle line:84%
of millions of dollars of
oil have been extracted

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and exported, yet
most of the people

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.030 align:middle line:84%
live in poverty on
less than $1 a day.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:20:02.280 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.750 align:middle line:10%
What we do not understand
is that we humans are

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:07.530 align:middle line:10%
only part of this ecosystem.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.317 align:middle line:10%
And when we kill
part of this system,

00:20:10.317 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:10%
we are killing ourselves.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
I think for a lot of people
who are born in privilege,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
there's a sense of
what a friend of mine

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.690 align:middle line:90%
calls the right not to know.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
know about poverty.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't have to
know about racism.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.870 align:middle line:10%
I don't have to know about
environmental degradation

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:10%
or environmental justice or
injustice because it's not me.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:84%
I've got my life, and
I've got my family.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:90%
And I can do what I want.

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But the world is not forgiving
of that much anymore.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Pollution carries.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Water runs out in
rich places, too.

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The forests are coming
down everywhere.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.310 align:middle line:84%
The fish in the
sea are depleting.

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's hurting us all.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's hurting
the poor first,

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.530 align:middle line:84%
but it's very, very
difficult to go through life

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:59.120 align:middle line:84%
anymore and not see it and
not feel it at some level

00:20:59.120 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:10%
Those of us in the modern world
have had access to more money,

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:10%
more food, more comfort,
more entertainment,

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.930 align:middle line:10%
more travel, and more
communication than any people

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:10%
who have ever lived.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:23.890 align:middle line:84%
But has all this
made us happier?

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:10%
The idea that material gain
leads to personal fulfillment

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.370 align:middle line:10%
has been demonstrated
not to be the case.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.330 align:middle line:10%
Although incomes
have skyrocketed

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.500 align:middle line:10%
in economically-advanced
countries,

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.480 align:middle line:10%
study after study has shown that
levels of reported happiness

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:10%
have remained the
same or even declined.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.940 align:middle line:90%


00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.900 align:middle line:84%
There is a great
loneliness of spirit today.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.240 align:middle line:10%
We're trying to cope
in the face of what

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.940 align:middle line:10%
seems to be overwhelming
evidence that who we are

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:10%
doesn't matter.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, we're yearning for
connection with each other,

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.480 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, with the powers
of nature, the possibilities

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.210 align:middle line:90%
of being alive.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.790 align:middle line:84%
When that tension
arises, we feel pain,

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:17.400 align:middle line:84%
and then we cover that over
with anything that we can use

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.640 align:middle line:90%
to disconnect and to go away.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.770 align:middle line:10%
The reason that people are into
this mass consumption nightmare

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.900 align:middle line:10%
dream is because
people are lonely.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And people are hurt,
and people really

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.980 align:middle line:84%
believe that more income, more
stuff, more consumption, more

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.930 align:middle line:84%
things, the relationship
with things,

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.950 align:middle line:84%
will fix the hunger
in the human heart.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.490 align:middle line:90%
And it will never work.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:10%
This is not the best
of all possible worlds,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:53.010 align:middle line:10%
even though it appears that
way on TV and advertisements.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I think people in their most
poignant and honest moments

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:05.430 align:middle line:84%
will admit this is really
hard right now for everybody.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:09.680 align:middle line:10%
The anguish we feel for what
is happening to our world

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:16.320 align:middle line:10%
is inevitable and
normal and even healthy.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
So pain is very useful.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Just don't be afraid
of it because if we

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.000 align:middle line:84%
are afraid to feel that, we
won't feel where it comes from.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And where it comes from is
love, our love for this world.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.755 align:middle line:84%
That's what is going
to pull us through.

00:23:31.755 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:90%

Now, if you would,
please lower or close

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.360 align:middle line:90%
your eyes for a moment.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Please notice your breath
going in, going out.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And now just sit
quietly, noticing

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:84%
how you're feeling right now,
not what you're thinking,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.680 align:middle line:90%
not what needs to be done.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.900 align:middle line:90%
There's time for that later.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
For now, see if you
can allow yourself

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.720 align:middle line:84%
to just feel in your body your
response to what you've seen.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
When you're ready, please take
a breath and open your eyes.
