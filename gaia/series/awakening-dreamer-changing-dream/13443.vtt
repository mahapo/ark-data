00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.480 align:middle line:84%
Underneath all these
unexamined assumptions,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.740 align:middle line:84%
it's really getting at the heart
of what we're talking about.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Because until we can really
look at those and explore those,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.460 align:middle line:84%
then we can make conscious
decisions about them.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:84%
The other thing I
think is an assumption

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740 align:middle line:84%
we make is that our worldview
is the only worldview.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 align:middle line:90%
And so there are other people.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.240 align:middle line:90%
There are other cultures.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.400 align:middle line:84%
There are groups that we
call indigenous people.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And these are people that
have a different worldview--

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
different assumptions--
a different way

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:90%
of looking at the world.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, I find
that we can learn

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.110 align:middle line:84%
more sometimes about ourselves
by seeing something different.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, oh, this is how I
am in relationship to that.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to look
at what might be considered

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.760 align:middle line:84%
an unexamined
assumption that affects

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.500 align:middle line:90%
our entire modern worldview.

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:02.720 align:middle line:10%
MALE NARRATOR (ON VIDEO): Of all
the countless assumptions that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.769 align:middle line:10%
make up our modern
industrial worldview,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.770 align:middle line:10%
there is one that is primary
and all-encompassing--

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:10%
the assumption that we
are separate from everyone

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:10%
and everything.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.020 align:middle line:10%
This assumption
shapes virtually all

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.895 align:middle line:10%
of our perceptions and actions.

00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:24.754 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE NARRATOR (ON
VIDEO): Over the centuries,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:84%
the story that's
been communicated

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.440 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world--
consciously or unconsciously--

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.730 align:middle line:84%
has been that the world operates
like a huge machine-- made up

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:84%
of separate parts
like a big clock.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
For the past 400 years,
the scientific tradition

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
has been trying to take the
clock apart and figure out

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.580 align:middle line:84%
how it works so we
can master it and use

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.610 align:middle line:90%
it for our own purposes.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:10%
A mechanistic view meant
that-- instead of seeing

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:10%
the interconnection
between things--

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:10%
there was a way
of analyzing what

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:10%
people were coming into contact
with and taking it apart.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So what evolved was
kind of a fragmented

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.080 align:middle line:90%
view of the natural world.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And we became hypnotized,
really, with the power that

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.260 align:middle line:90%
came out of this technology.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And we lost our
connection to each other.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
We lost our connection to
the mystery of universe.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a fundamental
misconception

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:90%
that we are separate.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.730 align:middle line:90%
We're learning that's not true.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.570 align:middle line:10%
If there's only one, then
whatever I do to you,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:10%
I do to me.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.290 align:middle line:10%
If there's only one, whatever
I do to the air, I do to me.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.260 align:middle line:10%
If there's only one,
whatever I do in society

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.870 align:middle line:10%
is what I'm actually doing to
myself-- doing to my family--

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.710 align:middle line:10%
doing to my children.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.177 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.177 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
MALE NARRATOR (ON VIDEO):
Spiritual traditions

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
have long taught that
separation is an illusion.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist teacher Thich
Nhat Hanh puts it this way.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:50.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
MALE NARRATOR (ON
VIDEO): Increasingly,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:84%
people in the modern
world are listening

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.280 align:middle line:84%
to the voices of
indigenous people,

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.660 align:middle line:84%
whose message has always been
that all things are connected.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:10%
We use another terminology
called [NON-ENGLISH LANGUAGE]

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
is all my relations.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
We try to recognize that we
are related to everything--

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:84%
to the animals, to the fish,
to the plants, to the trees,

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:26.590 align:middle line:84%
to the birds-- even
the microorganisms.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.850 align:middle line:90%
So that we are all related.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.310 align:middle line:10%
The foundational
understanding from my point

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.520 align:middle line:10%
of view or indigenous
point of view

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:10%
is that you are a
part of that land

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:10%
in a very interdependent way.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:90%
You are a part of the land.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's your body.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:90%
It's you.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do things to
the land that in the end

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:90%
comes back and destroys you.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.434 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:05.000 align:middle line:84%
MALE NARRATOR (ON VIDEO):
This deep recognition

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:84%
of interconnection is supported
by the current scientific

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.610 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the origin of
the universe-- which has shown

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
that all of creation is
profoundly connected at both

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:90%
the macro and micro level.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.370 align:middle line:10%
We can see that everything
that ever was, is, or will be

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.730 align:middle line:10%
was compressed into a space
smaller than a seed-- tinier

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:10%
than a tear-- more
minuscule than a molecule.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.630 align:middle line:84%
All space-- all time--
and the potential

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
for everything that
would ever exist

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500 align:middle line:90%
started as a single point.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
So in a very real sense, science
has discovered what indigenous

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.840 align:middle line:90%
people have known all along.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.270 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:90%
We are all connected.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.770 align:middle line:84%
We all come from the
very same source.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything we see
around us has developed

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
from the boiling cauldron
of the early Earth--

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
a sphere of lava that
miraculously gave rise

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to the sea and the
atmosphere-- and then life

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.970 align:middle line:90%
and its infinite expressions.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
As Brian Swimme says, the
earth was once molten rock

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:90%
and now sings operas.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.960 align:middle line:10%
It is not the case that
the earth was assembled.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we were
added to the earth.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was there
for our purposes.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.070 align:middle line:84%
But rather, we came
out of the earth.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.000 align:middle line:84%
We are the universe in
the form of a human.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's true of everyone.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing new
understanding of ourselves that

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:90%
is so profoundly inclusive.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And everyone is part of this.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:90%
Everything is part of this.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And we discover, as well,
a profound kinship--

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
that no matter what being we're
talking about on the planet,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:90%
we are related.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
We're related in
terms of energy.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
We're related in
terms of genetics.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.020 align:middle line:84%
We're all, in one way or
another, like a form of kin.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And that-- I just--
it's overwhelming.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's just now coming
into human awareness.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.810 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
a lot of reflection

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:90%
to embody this fully.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:84%
But it is a massive change
in human consciousness.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.040 align:middle line:84%
MALE NARRATOR (ON VIDEO):
Seeing ourselves as separate

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:84%
has had devastating consequences
on the planet and all of life.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, a new story about who
we are as a planetary family

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to shape the
consciousness on Earth.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.780 align:middle line:84%
Looking at our history
through this lens,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.870 align:middle line:84%
it could be said that
human beings have

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
been tragically mistaken--
rather than being

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.990 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally flawed.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.420 align:middle line:84%
This is good news, because
there's not much hope

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.570 align:middle line:90%
for an innately flawed species.

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But there is hope for
one that is recognized

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:90%
and is waking up from a trance.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.156 align:middle line:84%
That creates some powerful new
possibilities for the future.

00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.030 align:middle line:84%
And then, as we've
seen, the video

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:84%
does a fantastic
job of illustrating

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
that the assumption that we
have here in the modern world

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
of separation is not
the assumption that's

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
carried by all
other worldviews--

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.660 align:middle line:90%
all other peoples in the world.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And it could be that we see
that this particular assumption

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.380 align:middle line:84%
of separation is a
large contributing

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
factor to the last
centuries of human history--

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.690 align:middle line:84%
which have seen one
group of human beings

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.890 align:middle line:84%
exploit and dominate and
oppress other groups.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.280 align:middle line:84%
And maybe, what's
happening now is

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
we're beginning to wake up
and see that assumption is not

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.510 align:middle line:84%
an accurate assumption
for us to carry

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:90%
and work from and behave from.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.320 align:middle line:90%
And that's the exciting moment.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And I love the
piece in that video

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:53.220 align:middle line:84%
where we see that, actually,
as a species, we're not flawed.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.590 align:middle line:90%
We're simply mistaken.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we've gone off
along the wrong track.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And the good news about
that is we can change that.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.790 align:middle line:90%
We can understand that.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:90%
We can unravel that.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.990 align:middle line:90%
And we can choose again.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And so we're actually in
a profoundly exciting time

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
of re-orienting our
fundamental thinking

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:90%
and our behaviors as a species.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So I think we recognize
this story coming to us

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.940 align:middle line:90%
in a number of different ways.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And this new story beginning
to shape the consciousness here

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.390 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And it-- and it's as if when
we identify this connection--

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.755 align:middle line:84%
this sense that we're all
part of one unified whole

00:09:33.755 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
that the behaviors, which
previously would have been

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.660 align:middle line:84%
an assault on the planet or
an assault on each other,

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
become unimaginable.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So this sense of
interconnection allows us

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to re-choose behaviors in
every aspect of our lives.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to do
something a little bit

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.210 align:middle line:84%
different-- that's
going to require

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:90%
us to change up the space.

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
FEMALE NARRATOR (ON VIDEO): At
this point in the symposium,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.580 align:middle line:84%
we do an experiential
exercise created by author

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.450 align:middle line:90%
and activist Joanna Macy.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.620 align:middle line:84%
This milling exercise gives
participants the opportunity

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
to directly experience the
feelings of both separation

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:90%
and connection.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.090 align:middle line:90%
JON SYMES: Breathe deeply.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And once again, find
a quiet receptive

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:90%
space inside of yourself.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.175 align:middle line:84%
See if you can allow your
mind to be calm and centered.

00:10:28.175 --> 00:10:31.430 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And now, I invite you
to slowly open your eyes

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and imagine that
you're downtown.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:90%
It's lunch break.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And you've got some errands to
run before you go back to work.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like you begin
now to move around

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.561 align:middle line:84%
inside of this space as if you
are in that lunchtime things

00:10:50.561 --> 00:10:51.260 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And remember, you've got
a lot of things to do.

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's only a
short lunch break.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So actually, you
need to get a move on

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:84%
to get to all the places you
need to go to get back and be

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
back in time before anybody
discovers that you've

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.530 align:middle line:90%
actually taken longer.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And you might not
be as competent

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.145 align:middle line:90%
as they thought you were.

00:11:07.145 --> 00:11:09.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's lots to do--
lots to do-- lots to do--

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.385 align:middle line:84%
and only a short
time to get it done.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:15.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.490 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get back in time
with all these jobs done,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:84%
there's a fair chance
everything will fall apart.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:26.400 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And now, I invite you to
just slow down a little-- to

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, what would be
a more normal pace--

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:90%
but to keep walking.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.340 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And let yourself feel
now-- feeling your body

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:44.670 align:middle line:84%
right now-- whatever you're
experiencing and whatever

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.730 align:middle line:84%
the changes to this
place from where

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:90%
you were just a moment ago.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Then, I invite you
to find yourself

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:90%
in front of one other person.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy looking at this person.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you choose
to, hold their hand.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.255 align:middle line:84%
Behold, this
brother-- this sister.

00:12:09.255 --> 00:12:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.760 align:middle line:90%
Behold this wonderful person.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
You're looking into
the face of someone

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.811 align:middle line:84%
who deeply feels what's
truly going on in our world

00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:31.420 align:middle line:84%
Like you, this person
understands the full situation

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:84%
facing the earth and facing
the human species at this time.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They understand the
changes in the environment.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.820 align:middle line:84%
They see-- they get the
rampant social injustice.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.920 align:middle line:84%
They feel the disconnection
amongst people.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they haven't
closed their eyes.

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:90%
They haven't turned away.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.200 align:middle line:84%
This is someone like
you who is choosing

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.274 align:middle line:84%
to love the gift of being
alive in this time--

00:13:07.274 --> 00:13:08.515 align:middle line:90%
with all of its challenges.

00:13:08.515 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself now to experience
what it feels like to recognize

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
that you're not
alone-- what it feels

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
like to feel yourself
connected in this deep way

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.810 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.590 align:middle line:84%
ANITA SANCHEZ: I understand that
there's much that could be said

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:90%
from what you just experienced.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
What I'd like to do is
allow for-- if someone

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.335 align:middle line:84%
would like to share what that
experience was like for you.

00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
I noticed I always
keep a background

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:90%
sense of being separate.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.914 align:middle line:84%
And that this was an
opportunity to drop that.

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And what was available was
love-- kind of embarrassing,

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.730 align:middle line:84%
almost, how much I loved
this man in a moment

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.690 align:middle line:90%
and this entire group.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I-- I feel very touched by the
opportunity to really connect--

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and at the ease at
which we can, as people,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.700 align:middle line:84%
connect-- simply by making
eye contact in a moment.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Words don't feel necessary.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Explanations don't
feel necessary.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Context even feels optional.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:90%
It just feels pure.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:90%
It feels simple.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.550 align:middle line:90%
And it feels truth.

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I just had a real
sense of belonging.

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
And even thinking about the
word versus separation--

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and just the ease which
to let go of separation--

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and just belonging.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm contemplating
what that word actually

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:90%
means in the deeper sense.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:90%
