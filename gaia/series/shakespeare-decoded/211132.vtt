We will uncover the elaborate
cryptographic masterpiece

Dee embedded within
Shakespeare's works

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.680 align:middle line:84%
that reveals the
poet's true identity.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.190 align:middle line:10%
Connecting the dots on the
cover of his famous Sonnets,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:10%
we discover that Dee embedded
12 math constants, five of which

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.660 align:middle line:10%
were not even known at
the time of printing

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:10%
in 1609, along with the
geographical coordinates

Uniting the sonnet numbers
that contain the words "speed,"

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:10%
"light," and "pyramid," we
discover an equation that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:10%
reveals the speed of
light to 99.84% accuracy,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.330 align:middle line:10%

Using Dee's unique
cryptographic method,

we will examine the mysterious
Enochian tables that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:10%
were channeled to him by angels
through the medium Edward

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.700 align:middle line:10%
Kelley and learn how Dee used
this mysterious grid to create

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:10%
a system that ensured these
secret messages survived

Decrypting additional clues
within Shakespeare's plays,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
we will find sequences of
deliberately wrong page numbers

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.540 align:middle line:84%

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We'll also learn the foolproof
system Dee and Shakespeare used

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.940 align:middle line:84%
to draw attention to
specific dates, which

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
reveal that the entire Sonnets
sequence mirrors the structure

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.500 align:middle line:90%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:10%
We will add up
all the characters

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:10%
in Shakespeare's Sonnets
Dedication, his monument,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.150 align:middle line:10%
and gravestone and find
they sum to 624, coinciding

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.330 align:middle line:10%
with the fact that the
Enochian tables were channeled

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:10%
to Dee on June 24, 624
and contain 624 squares,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.200 align:middle line:10%
exposing an undeniable cipher
that leads to Holy Trinity

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:10%
Church in Stratford, England.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Add to this the fact that
the Sonnets Dedication

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.550 align:middle line:84%
is structured as 6 lines,
2 lines, and 4 lines.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:84%
Then discover that the T-H and
M-E ligatures on the monument

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
mimic the Freemason's
sacred triple tau symbol.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.140 align:middle line:84%
attractions and most protected
sites in England, Holy Trinity

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Church in Stratford.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:55.810 align:middle line:10%
Plus, it happens to be the most
sacred relic in the church,

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.810 align:middle line:10%
the Holy of Holies altar stone.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.300 align:middle line:10%
And all those warnings
at the entrance

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:10%
are likely due to the
war that's been raging

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:10%
for about 200 years
between the Stratfordians,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.870 align:middle line:10%
those are the ones who believe
only the man from Stratford

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.480 align:middle line:10%
could possibly have
been the great author,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.590 align:middle line:10%
and groups who believe the
writer was someone else.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Most prominent in those
camps are the Oxfordians.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.390 align:middle line:10%
They believe the 17th Earl
of Oxford, Edward de Vere,

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.430 align:middle line:10%
was responsible.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Needless to say, the
whole town of Stratford

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:84%
is dependent on the
Orthodox stories.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.460 align:middle line:84%
The major part of
their livelihood

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:90%
derives from the status quo.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.260 align:middle line:10%
So anyone breezing
into town claiming

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:10%
they have an answer to a
question the townsfolk won't

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:10%
even acknowledge exists is,
by default, pretty unwelcome.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, I went to the church and
to the bishop of the diocese.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
I told him I know where a
priceless Shakespeare relic is

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.000 align:middle line:84%
hidden that will bring the
church worldwide acclaim

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
and effectively end their
financial woes forever.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.800 align:middle line:10%
Let's open up the altar.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.090 align:middle line:10%
It's in there.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:84%
The immediate reaction was to
dismiss my theories out of hand

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.620 align:middle line:90%
without even giving it a look.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Are you a cryptographer?

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.890 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.460 align:middle line:84%
But do you have a master's
degree in mathematics

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.990 align:middle line:90%
or cybersecurity?

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
No, I'm actually
a pianist, but--

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.990 align:middle line:84%
thank you so much for
coming, Mr. Green.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.420 align:middle line:84%
No one was going to
take my claims seriously

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.440 align:middle line:84%
without the endorsement of
an actual cryptographer.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:10%
So I contacted the most
famous cryptographer

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.950 align:middle line:10%
in the world, Whitfield
Diffie, to ask, would he

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.830 align:middle line:10%
check my methods and
hopefully confirm

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:10%
my conclusions were sound, maybe
even give me some pointers.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
But his consultation
fee was $500 an hour.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:10%
And, well, I had
hundreds of pages

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.390 align:middle line:10%
of research and
discoveries, most of which

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:10%
were the kind that
you wouldn't normally

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:10%
associate with your standard
conception of Shakespeare,

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.990 align:middle line:10%
bizarre unexpected connections,
such as hidden references

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:12.340 align:middle line:10%
to the Great Pyramid of Giza,
Rosicrucian and Freemasonic

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:10%
symbolism in certain
plays on his gravestone,

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:10%
on the monument,
behind the altar

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.550 align:middle line:10%
in the Stratford church
and, most strange of all,

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:10%
strong clues that the
real Shakespeare faked

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.780 align:middle line:10%
his own death in
order to be free to do

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:10%
the most important side gig
of his career, the King James

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:10%
Bible.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't afford Diffie
to even look at the index

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to my list of findings,
but I got lucky.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.330 align:middle line:84%
His wife, Mary, was an avid
Egyptologist, it turns out.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And he seemed intrigued by
the Freemasonic connection.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.450 align:middle line:84%
So I suspect that was
the combination that

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.420 align:middle line:84%
led him to offer a rather
generous compromise.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.510 align:middle line:84%
He said he'd do a quick
analysis over dinner

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:90%
if I picked up the tab.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, he chose
the most expensive restaurant

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:90%
in Silicon Valley.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was a six-hour
drive for me.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But, hey, I would get to pick
the brain of a living legend.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:18.910 align:middle line:84%
The rest, as they
say, is mystery.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:24.550 align:middle line:84%
You see, in 1976, Diffie and
two associates solved an age-old

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
problem assumed by the greatest
math minds of all time to be

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:90%
unsolvable--

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
how to communicate
a password securely

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:90%
across an insecure channel.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
Their groundbreaking discovery
has impacted everything

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
from how the world's banking
systems operate to keeping

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:90%
the nuclear codes safe.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And while they were
at it, they just

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:84%
happened to make digital
online commerce possible.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.470 align:middle line:90%
It's called public key exchange.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how it works.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
Long before Edward Snowden,
long before even Wikileaks,

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:84%
the NSA tried to ban this
book because it revealed more

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.930 align:middle line:84%
about codebreaking than
they themselves knew.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.350 align:middle line:84%
Its author, David Kahn,
said Diffie's accomplishment

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.210 align:middle line:84%
was the most revolutionary
new concept in the field

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.730 align:middle line:90%
since the Renaissance.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a great magic
trick performed entirely

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.610 align:middle line:90%
with zeros and ones.

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Let's say Alice wants to
send some information to Bob

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.250 align:middle line:90%
in secret.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Their communication
is vulnerable

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:90%
because Eve is always listening.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, his system actually mixes
very large prime numbers.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
But he knew he'd never get
the suits to understand

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.420 align:middle line:84%
he was making the world
safer if brain fog set in

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.520 align:middle line:90%
as soon as he opened his mouth.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So instead of attempting
to explain this,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.930 align:middle line:84%
he simply showed
them this and said,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:05.980 align:middle line:84%
imagine two cans of paint, easy
to mix, impossible to unmix.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, Eve became the
name the agencies used to mean

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:90%
any eavesdropper implying.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, here was Diffie's
solution to all that.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Alice and Bob agree on a public
key, yellow, knowing full well

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.400 align:middle line:90%
that Eve will intercept it.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.620 align:middle line:84%
But then Alice creates her own
private key, let's say, red,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.460 align:middle line:84%
mixes it with the yellow
public key, and gets orange.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:10%
These are just large
prime numbers, remember.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Bob creates his own private
key, let's say, blue,

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.880 align:middle line:84%
mixes it with yellow,
and gets green.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Yellow isn't needed anymore.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And now Alice and Bob
communicate these new keys

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to each other,
knowing full well Eve

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
will steal these two,
but now the magic trick.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:10%
Alice mixes Bob's green with her
private red, producing brown.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.790 align:middle line:10%
Bob mixes Alice's orange
with his private blue,

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:10%
producing brown.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.460 align:middle line:10%
These are absolutely
mathematically identical.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.130 align:middle line:10%
No need for orange
or green anymore.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:10%
Alice and Bob are golden.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.170 align:middle line:84%
They can communicate
securely in public.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And sure, Eve will
still grab it.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
But without the red
and the blue keys,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.470 align:middle line:84%
she has no idea
how this was mixed.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:90%
Eve is shut out.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.600 align:middle line:84%
That's the miracle of
public key exchange.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And for about 45
years, this system

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.920 align:middle line:84%
has been impossible
to crack, even

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
using all the brute
force computing

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:90%
power available on the planet.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.820 align:middle line:90%
So we're having dinner--

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:42.070 align:middle line:84%
me, the piano player, him, the
math legend who saved the world

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.500 align:middle line:90%
and has friends in high places.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I mean really high places,
like NSA, CIA-type high places.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So I seize the moment,
and I say, look,

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.460 align:middle line:84%
what if Alice or,
let's say, Will

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.510 align:middle line:84%
wants to send a message
not across distance to Bob,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.660 align:middle line:90%
but across time to us.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.359 align:middle line:84%
Eve, during the
Renaissance, would have been

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:90%
the notorious Star Chamber.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
If Will's got a secret so
dangerous his entire life's

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
paper trail has to vanish, he
obviously needs a really secure

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
key to communicate
forward to a time

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
when it'll be safe
for it to be known.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So a public key text appears
in 1609, the dedication page

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:30.970 align:middle line:90%
to the Shakespeare's Sonnets.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And combined with
two inscriptions

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.030 align:middle line:84%
soon to come on the poet's
monument and gravestone,

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.630 align:middle line:84%
they form the equivalent
of the yellow key.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.920 align:middle line:84%
You're going to see these
in detail in episode two.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.030 align:middle line:84%
But for now, let me just
give you the broad strokes

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.740 align:middle line:90%
I gave Diffie.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Star Chamber could intercept
these, and they certainly did.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.710 align:middle line:84%
We know, for instance that
the Sonnets were suppressed

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:90%
as soon as they were published.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
But, still, a
handful of them have

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.990 align:middle line:84%
managed to reach us
400 years across time.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:10%
What Star Chamber
did not know is

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.880 align:middle line:10%
that Shakespeare
had his own Diffie

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.130 align:middle line:10%
guy working in the shadows
named Dr. John Dee.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:10%
And Dee had friends in high
places, too, very high places.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.350 align:middle line:84%
He was deeply into
the esoteric arts

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.990 align:middle line:84%
and communed with angels
for over a decade.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But, we'll get into
that soon enough.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So Shakespeare had his own
red and blue private keys.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:10%
This was the red one,
400-year-old private text

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.270 align:middle line:10%
marked with a
numbered grid system,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:10%
clearly telling
us how to arrange

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:10%
the public text to be
superimposed exactly

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.550 align:middle line:10%
over it letter for letter.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you in
the next episode

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.020 align:middle line:84%
how Dee's system
produced the code needed

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.330 align:middle line:90%
to accomplish this goal.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Suffice to say, though,
for now, it worked.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
He successfully sent
a password securely

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.300 align:middle line:84%
across an insecure
channel, resulting

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:07.060 align:middle line:84%
in a message across time
that essentially says,

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.150 align:middle line:84%
a record has been
preserved for posterity.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:10%
Look closely at the
consecrated altar stone

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.660 align:middle line:10%
where I have hidden
inside what I

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.160 align:middle line:10%
want you to know, public key
exchange, Renaissance-style.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:10%


00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Diffie sat there
for a long time,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:33.260 align:middle line:10%
unblinking like he'd seen
a ghost, Hamlet's perhaps.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.280 align:middle line:84%
I like to think he simply
recognized the system created

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.930 align:middle line:84%
400 years ago, almost
identical to the one he

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:90%
had created in 1976.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Finally, very slowly,
he said, if I were you,

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.115 align:middle line:90%
I would radar scan that altar.

00:19:57.115 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.440 align:middle line:84%
He then confided in me a few
words of advice concerning Eve

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:90%
that I cannot repeat publicly.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.780 align:middle line:84%
But that sent shivers
down my spine.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.890 align:middle line:10%
He was warning me that
without scientific proof,

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:10%
the truth of what
I'd found might never

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:10%
be allowed to come out.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.580 align:middle line:84%
This could affect
the monarchy, right?

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I nodded.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.344 align:middle line:90%
And he called for the check.

00:20:26.344 --> 00:20:29.662 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:29.662 --> 00:20:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.090 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, they knew me
at the Stratford church.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.130 align:middle line:84%
I'd made a number
of visits already

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
and made some fairly generous
contributions in exchange

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
for them letting me
film in areas normally

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
off limits to the
general public.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
I told them I was
writing a musical.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And all along, I'd been laying
the groundwork for something

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.980 align:middle line:84%
bigger, and I didn't
quite know what.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So I called them up
and asked, would they

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
like me to perform a
concert of some songs

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
from my Shakespeare musical
in the chancel by his grave?

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we just
had a booking fall through.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually an
opening in a couple of weeks.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:90%
Could I make it?

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:16.180 align:middle line:90%
I had about 10 days to prepare.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I assembled a
small team, someone

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.890 align:middle line:84%
to operate a rented scanner
system, someone else

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:23.390 align:middle line:90%
to secretly film it.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I had a huge banner printed
up advertising the musical.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.070 align:middle line:90%
Customs loved it at Heathrow.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
But its real purpose,
of course, was

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.960 align:middle line:84%
to hide what would be
happening at the altar.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:84%
Disabling the CCTV
cameras turned out

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:90%
to be quite simple, actually.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.070 align:middle line:84%
At the very end of
the concert, I simply

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.480 align:middle line:84%
asked for all the church
lights be turned off

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
so I could sing the final
song by candlelight.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
It was so beautiful and so dark.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
The forensic system, that
was shut off during the show

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:06.680 align:middle line:84%
because I put the piano
right up against the grave.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.910 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't risk
staining their Steinway.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I hired a local film crew
to shoot the concert, which

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.920 align:middle line:84%
distracted from my own secret
film crew behind the banner,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.490 align:middle line:84%
scanning and filming
in night vision.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:84%
The scan guy had
just four minutes

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:84%
while the lights were off
in which to do the scan.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:84%
He laid a protective
covering down so

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.710 align:middle line:90%
as not to harm the altar.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.080 align:middle line:84%
It had grid lines printed
on it to guide him

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:84%
as his eyes adjusted to
the near total darkness.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Song finished.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.800 align:middle line:90%
The lights came up.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.850 align:middle line:84%
The banner came down, and
nobody was any the wiser.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.600 align:middle line:84%
We hadn't taken anything
except zeros and ones.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:10%
It was the perfect non-crime.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, we could have been
arrested, of course.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:23:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Back at the hotel, we nervously
checked the footage, well,

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to be sure our guy had
remembered to switch it on.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.790 align:middle line:84%
He'd only had part of an
afternoon to practice with it.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:90%
We hit send.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.500 align:middle line:10%
And within a few seconds,
a 400-year-old secret

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.470 align:middle line:10%
was on the hard drives of
two of the leading radar

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.620 align:middle line:10%
labs in America.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was sworn
to secrecy, even him.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.790 align:middle line:84%
I left the church feeling
we had accomplished

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:29.170 align:middle line:84%
what Shakespeare himself clearly
hoped somebody would eventually

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.000 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.900 align:middle line:84%
All that remained was to await
the result from the labs.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.830 align:middle line:10%
All consecrated
Catholic altar stones

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.040 align:middle line:10%
have to have a saint's
cavity hewn into them.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.820 align:middle line:84%
It's a small hole that
holds relics of a saint.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:53.290 align:middle line:84%
A little blue area is what
you'd expect to see in the scan.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
The two labs worked
independently of one another

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:84%
using separate protocols
to assure accuracy.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And both reported
the same result.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.259 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
This perfect replica
built to scale

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.430 align:middle line:84%
allows us to see exactly
what the scan found--

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:27.370 align:middle line:84%
a cavity over 6 and 1/2
feet long, 8 inches deep,

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.520 align:middle line:90%
up to 30 inches wide.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It's 250 times the size
it's supposed to be.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:10%
You don't cut a hole that big
into solid polystyrene, I mean,

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:49.810 align:middle line:10%
marble unless you're going to
put something that big into it.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, the scan
reveals differing densities,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.420 align:middle line:84%
indicating the presence
of various items

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:90%
within this huge cavity--

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.500 align:middle line:84%
the missing manuscripts,
new priceless masterpieces.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.400 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to know?

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.100 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you one of the
most precious items that

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:84%
will be found inside
the altar stone

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.570 align:middle line:90%
when it's eventually opened up.

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's the original Sonnets
written in the hand of the bard

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
Actually, precious
can't even begin

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.260 align:middle line:84%
to describe such a treasure
considering you learned already

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:28.580 align:middle line:84%
that Shakespeare left
absolutely zero paper trail.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Finding anything belonging
to the great poet

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:33.530 align:middle line:90%
would be literally priceless.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I can predict with confidence
that the Sonnets are there

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:84%
because the same codes that were
scientifically proven accurate

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.910 align:middle line:84%
by the radar scan are
the very same codes that

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.580 align:middle line:84%
predict he chose
the Holy of Holies

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.665 align:middle line:84%
to be the secret resting place
of his most divine love poems.

00:25:51.665 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.420 align:middle line:10%
In the next episode,
we'll examine in detail

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.310 align:middle line:10%
how those codes came into
being and who exactly Dr. John

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:10%
Dee was.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.762 align:middle line:90%


00:26:05.762 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But I know you're
anxious to start.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.550 align:middle line:90%
So here's just a brief preview.

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It all centers around
the name of God

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.000 align:middle line:84%
given to Moses on Mount
Sinai, which is commonly

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.420 align:middle line:84%
translated from the original
Hebrew as, "I am that I am."

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the first clue
that starts us off

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.070 align:middle line:84%
on this magnificent journey,
because it's something

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare writes in
one of his sonnets.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.955 align:middle line:84%
He says, "No, I am
that I am, and they

00:26:33.955 --> 00:26:37.330 align:middle line:84%
that level at my abuses
reckon up their own.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.740 align:middle line:84%
I may be straight though
they themselves be bevel.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:48.040 align:middle line:84%
By their rank thoughts, my
deeds must not be shown."

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
These words-- reckon,
straight, bevel, rank--

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.640 align:middle line:84%
are all Freemasonic
terms, indicating

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that those of high rank
within the secret societies

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:02.560 align:middle line:84%
are declaring, his
deeds must not be shown.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.530 align:middle line:84%
He must, in other
words, be anonymous.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.687 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:08.687 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
It was extremely dangerous
for Shakespeare to say that,

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.793 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get into
why soon enough.

00:27:14.793 --> 00:27:16.460 align:middle line:84%
But as you're about
to see for yourself,

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
the great poet author has
hidden so many secrets

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.500 align:middle line:90%
inside the Sonnets.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.020 align:middle line:84%
It becomes clear that
this little book of poems

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.170 align:middle line:84%
is the central Rosetta
Stone, if you will,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.570 align:middle line:84%
through which he reveals the
truth not only of his identity,

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.300 align:middle line:84%
but the great spiritual
truth hiding deep

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.820 align:middle line:90%
inside every single one of us.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.514 align:middle line:84%
So what is the Hebrew name
of God revealed in Exodus?

00:27:43.514 --> 00:27:48.440 align:middle line:90%
Ehyeh asher ehyeh--

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I am that I am.

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes reduced to just,
I am that, or Ehyeh asher.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at this
pen name the author chose

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:90%
to conceal his true identity.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:90%
I am asher.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.910 align:middle line:90%
The name of God Will Speake.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that's how speak was
spelled in Shakespeare's day.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:20.000 align:middle line:84%
He's clearly indicating he's
a vehicle for divine truth.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:84%
There's hardly a Shakespearean
scholar who would argue with

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.820 align:middle line:84%
that, whether Stratfordian,
Oxfordian, Baconian,

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:90%
or any other "-ordian."

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.000 align:middle line:90%
They all agree.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:90%
His work is divine.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Setting aside just
the "I am Will"

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:84%
part, which, of course, is
the ultimate creative force

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.770 align:middle line:84%
of all life, we find
that even just the name

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.640 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare itself has
its own hidden meaning.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
Seek a sephar.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, a sephar is a
Hebrew word that means

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.370 align:middle line:90%
a numbering system or book.

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the root
word sephir or cipher.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
We're all familiar, I'm
sure, with the Jewish tree

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:90%
of life symbol, the sefirot.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.120 align:middle line:84%
So seek a sephar
literally means look

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:84%
for a secret numbering
system in a cipher

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:25.100 align:middle line:84%
codebook, through
which I am that,

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.910 align:middle line:90%
the divine name, Will Speake.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, that
cipher codebook that

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.400 align:middle line:84%
contains a secret
numbering system

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.940 align:middle line:90%
is Shakespeare's Sonnets.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I very much look
forward to showing you

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful
secrets it contains.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Whoever the real
Shakespeare was,

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:50.030 align:middle line:84%
he, she, they pulled off the
greatest vanishing act ever.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't yet know why.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:56.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're going to find
out in the next six episodes.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
But we do know where he
left the answer for it.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.340 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:04.690 align:middle line:90%
