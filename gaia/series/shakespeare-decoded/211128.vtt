00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:10%
>> In this episode,
we enter the dark,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:10%
mysterious world of mathematics.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.790 align:middle line:84%
I know, most people's
reaction to that word

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:84%
is usually abject horror,
followed by panic.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
But don't worry, you
won't have to do a thing.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to show you a
side of Shakespeare's genius

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.370 align:middle line:84%
the world never knew existed,
a totally unique Dee-de Vere

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.840 align:middle line:84%
phenomenon for balancing left
brain right brain perspectives

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:90%
that I call math-oetics.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
It's that combination
again that tells us

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.010 align:middle line:84%
the ultimate truth that
time and distance are,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.960 align:middle line:90%
in fact, one thing.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Einstein's spacetime it's
essentially geometry.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to see that
John Dee created an icon that

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.530 align:middle line:84%
defines the unity of
all known math constants

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and hid it in plain sight
within the cover of solids.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
It's his GPS system,
Geometrically Perfect Sonnet.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:10%
You're also going to
see a system Shakespeare

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.910 align:middle line:10%
uses to draw our attention
to specific dates that

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:10%
have been fixed to help us
solve the puzzle he's left us.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And finally, you'll see proof
that Dee and de Vere knew about

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
really big distances like
Earth to Sun, Earth to Moon,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and the distance light
travels in a second.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:84%
I know it's an outrageous claim,
say that someone 400 years ago

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:84%
without even a
telescope accomplished

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.440 align:middle line:90%
what you're about to see.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.330 align:middle line:90%
It will seem impossible.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.730 align:middle line:84%
But his system, the Shakespeare
equation, is duplicatable

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
and it proves itself
several times over.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:10%
You see, the great
poet knew only too well

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:10%
the frustrating dilemma
that poetry, words,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420 align:middle line:10%
the loves of his
life, no matter how

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:10%
beautiful or
masterfully combined

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:10%
are ultimately subjective.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Their truth will
always be filtered

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.650 align:middle line:84%
through the interpretation
of the reader.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the authority,
the mathematical aspect

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:84%
of the codes lies in the
probability of their randomness

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:90%
being essentially zero.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.490 align:middle line:84%
When the same message is
repeated over and over,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
such proof is not
open to discussion.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:90%
It just is.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It's convincing beyond
all possibility of doubt.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:84%
That's why Shakespeare
left us an overabundance

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.160 align:middle line:84%
of mathematical codes,
alchemically intertwined

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.510 align:middle line:84%
with his beloved poetic codes
so that whether we respond

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.380 align:middle line:84%
predominantly to the
poetry, as most of us do,

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.710 align:middle line:84%
or to the math, as about
six or seven of us do,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:84%
we're left with this wonderful
combination of math-oetics

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.170 align:middle line:84%
which satisfies everyone
and leaves the few remaining

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:90%
doubters necessarily mute.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.340 align:middle line:84%
They are two sides
of the same coin

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:90%
of the realm of possibilities.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.850 align:middle line:90%

It was the week of
December 21, 2012.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.220 align:middle line:10%
The much-anticipated end
of the Mayan calendar

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.740 align:middle line:10%
and a strange
intuition suddenly came

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.630 align:middle line:10%
upon me, an unshakable awareness
that Shakespeare indeed

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:10%
had embedded the speed
of light into sonnets.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea where
this came from.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
I had no reason even
for believing it.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd done two years of
preliminary research.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.970 align:middle line:84%
Then for six years, I'd
made countless discoveries

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:90%
all from the poetic perspective.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And though I didn't
know it at the time,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.610 align:middle line:84%
this was to be the start
of the next six years

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:84%
of almost nothing but math
and geometry discoveries.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the last four
years that have shown me

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that working six years
in only right-brain mode

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.780 align:middle line:84%
and then six years of
only left-brain mode

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.830 align:middle line:84%
were inexorably leading
towards alchemical balance,

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.530 align:middle line:84%
the true wedding of whole brain
mode, unity, consciousness.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.110 align:middle line:10%
But back then, all
I knew was there

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:10%
had to be this
direct relationship

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:10%
between the numbering of the
sonnets that contained the word

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.370 align:middle line:10%
speed, and those that
contain the word light.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:10%
It's crazy, I know, but
it had been triggered

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.530 align:middle line:10%

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.370 align:middle line:10%
in the "First Folio," the most
expensive printed book ever.

Funny thing is scholars say
it would be worth a lot more

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
if it hadn't been full
of such awful wrong page

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.230 align:middle line:90%
numbers and botched printing.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, they're right
but for the wrong reasons.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.710 align:middle line:84%
Once it becomes
known that those,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.710 align:middle line:84%
it was about 67 so-called
wrong page numbers,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.820 align:middle line:84%
they're all part of one
gigantic interconnected code

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:90%
that solves the entire mystery.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And the price of those
folios will skyrocket,

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm telling you.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:90%
You heard it here first, folks.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Get one cheap now while you
still can, I'm just saying.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
The very first of these wrong
page numbers occurs here.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:84%
It goes from 48
to 49 to 58 to 51.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it should be 50
but esoteric mathematicians,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
like myself, meaning
untrained, know

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that the slope angle
of the Great Pyramid

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.960 align:middle line:84%
is 51 degrees and just
between 50 and 51 minutes.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So this might be about
the pyramid again.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough, Shakespeare
gives a broad hint down

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:10%
at the bottom that
incorrectly numbered page,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.310 align:middle line:10%
where Master Ford says,
"here, here, here, be my keys.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:10%
Ascend my chambers.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:10%
Search, seek, find out."

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
In the play it's a
comedy scene in which

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
he's searching in his
three bed chambers

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:84%
for Falstaff, who he believes
has been texting his wife.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.880 align:middle line:90%
But of course, it's also a code.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:10%
And the three chambers are
those inside the Great Pyramid,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:10%
connected by their
ascending passageways.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.830 align:middle line:10%
Search, seek, find out.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:84%
But then of course,
Shakespeare takes the idea

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:90%
to an entirely different level.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Let me show you what he does.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:84%
We might as well start with
the most mind-blowing system

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
of all, the
Shakespeare equation.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:27.540 align:middle line:84%
In Sonnets, do a search
on the word "speed."

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:90%
It occurs only three times.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Once it's on at 50,
twice it's on at 51.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.820 align:middle line:10%
Now, do a search on
the word "light."

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:10%
We multiply all
the light sonnets,

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:10%
all the speed sonnets, and
divide speed into light.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Speed of light, it's a ratio.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's like one-fourth
of something.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.350 align:middle line:84%
The answer at this point
makes no sense yet,

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.280 align:middle line:84%
but I knew there had to be a key
even though I didn't know yet

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:90%
where this was leading.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.368 align:middle line:84%
My intuition kept whispering,
"pyramid, pyramid."

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:04.035 align:middle line:84%
Since that's so
important to Rosicrucian

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and Freemasonic philosophy,
I looked and found

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.245 align:middle line:84%
the only sonnet that has
the word pyramid in it

00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:17.160 align:middle line:84%
is number 123, of course,
123, it's obvious.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:90%
So I multiplied by that.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Still didn't ring
any bells but I

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:84%
was looking for the well-known
speed of light number

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:84%
which, as we all know, is
defined in meters per second

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
as 299,792,458
meters per second.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:90%
We all know that.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.460 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn
some advanced math

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and trig before it clicked.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
I realized, oh, he

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
must be working in ancient
Egyptian measurements.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, converting Egyptian
royal cubits into meters

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:90%
turns out to be very simple.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.320 align:middle line:84%
You just multiply
by pi over six.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:90%
So I did.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And there it was.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.970 align:middle line:90%
Astonishing.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:05.170 align:middle line:10%
The speed of light in meters
per second, to 99.84% accuracy.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:10%
And it's not a fluke.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.600 align:middle line:84%
And what proves it is that
the system can be duplicated.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that contain the words
you're looking for.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
In the middle,
multiply by what I've

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:84%
called Shakespeare equation,
123 times pi over six.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
On the right, would
be the solution.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.970 align:middle line:84%
For instance, two other really
important astronomical values

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
are the average distance Earth
to Sun, and Earth to Moon.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:10%
Just fill in the blank
spaces with the numbers

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:10%
of the sonnets that
contain the word Earth,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:10%
and the numbers of the sonnets
that contain the word Sun,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:10%
multiply by the number
of the only sonnet that

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:10%
contains the word distance, 44.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Take that result, multiply
by the Shakespeare equation,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.480 align:middle line:84%
123 times pi over
six and there it is.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.460 align:middle line:84%
The average distance
Earth to Sun.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:01.870 align:middle line:10%
Accurate to 99.994%.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Here's the same process with
the Moon sonnets replacing Sun

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.520 align:middle line:90%
sonnets.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:10%
Accurate to 99.9%.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.630 align:middle line:10%
Any questions?

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.760 align:middle line:10%
OK, I said that was the
most mind-blowing of all.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.800 align:middle line:90%
I lied.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
His GPS system is
Geometrically Perfect Sonnets.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I reasoned that if these
major math values were hidden

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.020 align:middle line:84%
within the sonnets
themselves, what

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
has been staring us in the
face for over 400 years

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:90%
on the cover?

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Dee had encoded the Sonnet
Dedication page using dots,

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.120 align:middle line:90%
if you remember.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.690 align:middle line:10%
So the title page might be
using dots in a similar way

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:10%
but there are only six of them.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.820 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps they should
be connected.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:10%
Look at this italic T. You
can connect these two dots

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:10%
by drawing a straight
line along its slope.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:10%
It acts like a T-square.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.970 align:middle line:10%
The G-dot is about six times
the size of all the others

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:10%
so it seems to be
saying, hello, over here.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.530 align:middle line:10%
Connect the two ends of
this line to the G-dot

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle line:10%
and we have a perfect
right angle triangle.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm working with the most
accurate digital version

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.440 align:middle line:10%
of the Sonnets
title page available

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:10%
licensed from the
Folger Shakespeare

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:10%
Library in Washington, DC.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.410 align:middle line:10%
It's blown up five
times life size,

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.920 align:middle line:10%
and measured to an extreme three
decimal places of accuracy.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:90%
This is not just close.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:90%
This is perfect.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Keeping the same
hypotenuse, we connect

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
to the end of this line,
just hanging out there.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:84%
same thing, another
perfect right triangle.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.640 align:middle line:90%
Here, too, same thing.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, this one is not
just any right triangle,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
this one's a perfect 3, 4, 5
triangle one of Freemasonry's

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:90%
most revered symbols.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.210 align:middle line:10%
And perhaps the
only equation we all

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.470 align:middle line:10%
remember from school, right?

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.500 align:middle line:10%
Pythagorean theory,
3-squared plus 4-squared

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:10%
equals 5-squared, right?

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.210 align:middle line:90%
Now, the magic.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:84%
A perfect circle passes through
all these marked points.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And the common hypotenuse
of these four triangles

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.040 align:middle line:90%
is the diameter of the circle.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.450 align:middle line:10%
This is a visual representation
of a famous theorem by Thales

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.900 align:middle line:10%
of Miletus, who was
Pythagoras' mentor

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.870 align:middle line:10%
but is most famous for
being the first person

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:10%
to measure the height
of the Great Pyramid.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And he did it using the
geometry of right triangles.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.770 align:middle line:84%
If we now connect where the
circle intersects the two

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.770 align:middle line:84%
seemingly random lines, if
I have them all together,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.330 align:middle line:90%
six right triangles.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So what's all this
geometry doing on the cover

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:90%
of a little book of poetry?

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, Dee was the only
one capable of pulling off

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
something like this
and he didn't do it

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:90%
because it looks pretty.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:10%
You can't even see it until
you apply his principles.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:10%
So we must be meant to measure
these lines in some way.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And spacetime geometry,
remember, is all about ratios.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.570 align:middle line:10%
So first one perfect
to three decimals.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:10%
We all recognize it, pi.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:10%
Opposite side, not so well-known
but just as important,

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.790 align:middle line:10%
e known as Euler's number,
it governs the rate of growth

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.570 align:middle line:10%
in higher mathematics,
calculus, probability theory.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
It was not discovered
until 1669 by Isaac Newton.

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.420 align:middle line:84%
But here it is,
60 years earlier.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:10%
Here's e minus 1.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.540 align:middle line:10%
Even today it's not yet
recognized as being important,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:10%
yet it's the Egyptian
royal cubit in relation

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:10%
to the imperial foot.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:10%
This one is something called
Brun's constant, very important

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:10%
value to do with
twin prime numbers,

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:10%
also significant in the
Great Pyramid, not discovered

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.070 align:middle line:10%
until 1919.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Here's phi and little
phi well known back

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:13.810 align:middle line:84%
then as the golden ratio derived
from the Fibonacci series.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:10%
These reveal T, a
variation on Fibonacci

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:10%
called the Tribonacci series.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Not studied as far as
we know until 1914.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:10%
Here's another unknown, the
Euler-Mascheroni constant

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:10%
or gamma is important
in connection

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:10%
with the harmonic
series in music.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And its inverse, the
square root of 3.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.120 align:middle line:10%
Even the lines
that hang out here

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:10%
are not random they give
us the extremely important

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.560 align:middle line:10%
square roots of 2, 5, and 6.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:10%
But there's more.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:10%
If we make this
green line represent

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:55.600 align:middle line:10%
1 foot and the blue line
is 1 Egyptian royal cubit.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.400 align:middle line:84%
Remember the speed
of light solution

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Dee was working in royal
cubits before we converted them

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:90%
into meters.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.150 align:middle line:10%
And here, the two red lines
combined are just that.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.780 align:middle line:10%
They are 1 meter.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.470 align:middle line:10%
All together, this reveals
precise knowledge of 12

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:10%
of the most important math
constants, five of which

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.750 align:middle line:10%
were utterly
unknown at the time.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Plus, the exact
value of the meter,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:90%
also unknown at the time.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the relationship
between the three

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.810 align:middle line:84%
major measurement
systems of the world

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and their inherent sacred
connection to the Great

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.050 align:middle line:90%
Pyramid.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Still, all of this,
unrecognized today.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
All done with two
lines and four dots.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.670 align:middle line:84%
It's been staring us in
the face 400 for years.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.180 align:middle line:90%
But now, hang in there.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.930 align:middle line:10%
Because the words left
outside the invisible circle

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:10%
are "By G," well,
to the Pythagoreans,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.990 align:middle line:10%
G meant geodesy,
measuring the Earth.

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:10%
Here, it says "to be," so
to be measuring the Earth.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:10%
And now, the two dots
after the internal T. T.,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:10%
these allow us to see a
horizontal baseline pointing

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:17.510 align:middle line:10%
to an E hanging outside the
circle, indicating east, I bet.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Another baseline is
tangent to the circle

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.120 align:middle line:84%
at G, pointing straight to
the end of the lower line.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.310 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't random at all.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:10%
None of this is.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Since all these lines
are radiating out

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.690 align:middle line:84%
from this huge
G-dot and the system

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is suggesting
measuring the Earth,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe these two points are
lines of latitude and longitude.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.220 align:middle line:84%
One is oriented to the east
of its baseline, the other

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:90%
to the north of its baseline.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
And the only remaining letters
left outside the circle are--

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.050 align:middle line:90%
drum roll, please--

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
NE, northeast.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:10%
The geographical coordinates
of the Great Pyramid

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:04.275 align:middle line:10%
with a latitude that's
99.999% accurate.

00:17:04.275 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, that's another
speed of light hint

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:10%
because the actual latitude
of the center of the pyramid

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:10%
is the speed of light number
but in degrees, 299792458.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, as amazing as all
that was to discover,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
I knew one more
device would be needed

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
to go deeper into this
puzzle and identify

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:90%
significant dates in the year--

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.420 align:middle line:90%
the Sonnets time code.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
Since the one recurrent
theme of the Sonnets is time,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.990 align:middle line:84%
the poet is constantly
comparing earthly

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.890 align:middle line:84%
with spiritual time,
temporal with eternal time.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:46.930 align:middle line:10%
And since I already
knew Dee's system had

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.640 align:middle line:10%
sent a secure message
to us across time,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:10%
I suspected the Sonnets might
be used in some way for keeping

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:10%
track of that, of dates.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.010 align:middle line:10%
Overlaying them onto
a 365-day calendar,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.820 align:middle line:10%
sonnet 1 would be January
the 1st, sonnet 32

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.160 align:middle line:10%
would be February
the 1st, et cetera.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.800 align:middle line:10%
He runs out of
markers at sonnet 154,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.545 align:middle line:10%
but Malvolio gave his
instructions, remember,

00:18:14.545 --> 00:18:18.130 align:middle line:10%
in "Twelfth Night," to
revolve, just send them

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.740 align:middle line:10%
around once more starting here.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And then again here, until
all the dates are full.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.550 align:middle line:84%
So if Shakespeare
wanted a means of hiding

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.980 align:middle line:84%
sensitive information
about certain dates

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:84%
important in his life,
the poet would now

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:84%
have a map with
the ability to mark

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
dated events he
wants to comment on

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:84%
by associating a specific
sonnet number with that date.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Queen's birth,
Queen's death, and her funeral.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:52.340 align:middle line:84%
When you read the associated
sonnets covering those dates,

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.960 align:middle line:84%
you see cryptic veiled
allusions to those subjects.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you just
three coded dates that

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:02.880 align:middle line:90%
prove the system conclusively.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:10%
Here, we're looking at the
original Sonnets publication.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It goes from 114,
115, to 119 to 117.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.380 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, this
should be sonnet 116.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:10%
It's the only incorrectly
numbered sonnet

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.130 align:middle line:10%
in the entire book.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.850 align:middle line:84%
The 6 has been
inverted into a 9,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.800 align:middle line:84%
it's one of Dee's
favorite devices.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It represents the Zodiac symbol
for Cancer, his own birth sign,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:90%
balanced mirror opposites.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.570 align:middle line:10%
The cusp of Gemini into
Cancer is the summer solstice.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:10%
So what's the date of
the proper sonnet 116?

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.040 align:middle line:10%
It's April 26th.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:52.410 align:middle line:10%
That date is listed in the
church registry for 1564

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:10%
as little Shakespeare's
baptism date, April 26th,

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:10%
The three X's next to
it on the certificate

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:10%
were supposedly marks
left by witnesses.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.200 align:middle line:10%
The whole family was
illiterate after all, so not

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:10%
the most promising start for the
future world's greatest writer.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Hey, here's something.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.380 align:middle line:84%
If you find yourself trying to
explain all this to your family

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:84%
skeptics, here's a
simple way you can maybe

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.280 align:middle line:90%
get through to them.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
So the Stratford family
tree goes like this.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare's parents,
totally illiterate.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare, greatest
writer in the world.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare's children,
totally illiterate.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, Shakespeare never
taught his daughters to read.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But hey, maybe these are not
the family's illiterate marks

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.220 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.920 align:middle line:10%
Maybe they're just another clue.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.160 align:middle line:10%
Three crosses, yes.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.120 align:middle line:10%
Orthodox scholars insist this
wrong number is just a printing

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.660 align:middle line:10%
error but the poet actually goes
out of his way to tell us no.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.460 align:middle line:10%
If this be error
and upon me proved,

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:10%
I never writ nor no man
ever loved he's telling us.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:10%
This is not an error.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:10%
And he confirms it in line 5,
oh no, it is an ever fixed mark,

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.210 align:middle line:10%
ever again.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.230 align:middle line:10%
Edward de Vere.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.440 align:middle line:84%
This date has been
fixed by me, e-vere,

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.840 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that if the sonnet
number is wrong, then the date

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:90%
it refers to is wrong.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare's baptism
date has been fixed.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.380 align:middle line:90%
It's part of the code.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So you remember the monument
and its pattern of 4/26?

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But Malvolio tells us the codes
go forwards and backwards,

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.740 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:51.770 align:middle line:84%
So Hebraic fashion, 6/24,
and that's June 24th here.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.110 align:middle line:10%
So what sonnet is
attached to that date?

00:21:55.110 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Sonnet 21, also has
the word fixed in it.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:04.140 align:middle line:90%
Why is June 24 significant?

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:06.090 align:middle line:84%
In the 16th century,
England was still

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:09.330 align:middle line:84%
using the old pagan date
for the summer solstice.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:84%
Midsummer night's
eve was celebrated

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
as it cusps into midsummer's
day June 24, 6/24.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It's the moment of passing
from Gemini into Cancer,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.560 align:middle line:84%
69, the very pinnacle
of Royal Arch Masonry

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.250 align:middle line:84%
symbolism for the sun at its
highest point in the Equinox

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.780 align:middle line:90%
cycle.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.070 align:middle line:84%
June 24 is also the feast day
of Saint John the Baptist,

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Patron Saint of Freemasons.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.470 align:middle line:10%
And finally at midnight on
the cusp of summer solstice,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:10%
Edward de Vere disappeared.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:10%
History records that
he died on June 24th

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.650 align:middle line:10%
but no one said a word.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.420 align:middle line:10%
He was the Lord
Great Chamberlain

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:10%
of England, the most famous
nobleman in the land.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:10%
Yet there were no eulogies,
no outpourings of grief,

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:10%
no one wrote so much as a letter
commenting on his passing.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:90%
So no, he did not die.

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Sonnet 21 tells us the date
was fixed as was the 4/26

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.520 align:middle line:90%
date for Shakespeare's baptism.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.230 align:middle line:10%
So does the poet use the
word fixed anywhere else

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:10%
in the sonnet?

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, in just one
more, number 101.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Any time he uses a
word only three times,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.310 align:middle line:84%
it's very important
so you pay attention.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.950 align:middle line:10%
Note, the first character
of each of these three

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:40.115 align:middle line:10%
sonnets, the only ones to have
the word fixed in them, S, O,

00:23:40.115 --> 00:23:45.910 align:middle line:10%
L, sol, the Sun, the solstice.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are 201 courses in
the Great Pyramid so 101 marks

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.360 align:middle line:90%
the exact center course.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And to understand
its significance,

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:00.680 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at the structure
of the sonnets themselves.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.340 align:middle line:84%
We don't easily grasp today
that during the Renaissance,

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.300 align:middle line:84%
poets placed almost as great
an importance on structure

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:90%
as on content.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.410 align:middle line:84%
The various sections
are universally

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.020 align:middle line:84%
recognized as
follows: 1 through 17

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.940 align:middle line:84%
are called the
procreation sonnets

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:84%
because in every single one
he's urging the fair youth

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:90%
to beget a child.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.310 align:middle line:90%
So his name will live on.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Eighteen through 125 are
the fair youth sonnets,

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.910 align:middle line:84%
supposedly detailing the love
life of the fair youth who

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
may be the mysterious Mr.
WH named in the dedication,

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.630 align:middle line:90%
126 is called an envoy.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.060 align:middle line:84%
It divides the
fair youth section

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:43.070 align:middle line:84%
from the next section named
dark lady, 127 through 152

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.310 align:middle line:84%
is supposedly written about
a dark-complexioned lover.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
And finally, 153, 154, the bath
sonnets, very misunderstood

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and even said by some to be
a mistake or very juvenile

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.750 align:middle line:90%
efforts by a young Shakespeare.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But when viewed
in linear fashion,

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.450 align:middle line:84%
the structure makes
absolutely no sense.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But given the fascination we've
seen with the Great Pyramid,

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.830 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we're meant to
revolve the sections

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
and make the 17 procreation
sites the base, 17th earl,

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Continue up,
decreasing each level

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.140 align:middle line:90%
by one in pyramid fashion.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The fair youth section
then ends indeed

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:90%
at a pyramid course level.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It certainly looks like
he's building a pyramid.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.740 align:middle line:84%
The dark lady section
then ends precisely where

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:36.910 align:middle line:84%
the real Great Pyramid
platform would be.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.710 align:middle line:84%
At this point, it
seems the poet has

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
created a Sonnets replica
of the Great Pyramid

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.320 align:middle line:90%
without its pyramid in.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.560 align:middle line:84%
If he had written
only one bath sonnet,

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.060 align:middle line:84%
no doubt this
structure would have

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.910 align:middle line:84%
been recognized
two centuries ago

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.600 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
perfect triangular

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.590 align:middle line:90%
number, 153 on a base 17.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Why did he have to ruin it by
giving us two bath sonnets?

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, couldn't make it
that simple, could he?

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.670 align:middle line:84%
There had to be
some fun in this.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Sonnets 153 and
154 are essentially

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
the same sonnet written in
two slightly different styles.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Cupid, the little love God laid
by his brand, laid by his side

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.370 align:middle line:84%
his heart in flaming
brand, fell asleep,

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
lying once asleep,
and so on and so on.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the same story
all the way throughout.

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Each reference is heat,
holy fire of love, the Sun.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:84%
And cold, the Goddess
Diana, the Moon.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.160 align:middle line:84%
These are the
opposites that must

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.750 align:middle line:84%
be balanced to achieve
alchemical union as depicted

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.560 align:middle line:84%
in this Rosicrucian emblem,
all taking place in what's

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.820 align:middle line:90%
called an alchemical bath.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the two
sonnets of the pinnacle

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:84%
are intended to
be merged into one

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to represent the missing pyramid
of the actual Great Pyramid.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
don't think in terms

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.280 align:middle line:84%
of such structural
perfection these days.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So we would never think
of taking the trouble

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that the fixed
date we have for the Stratford

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:20.360 align:middle line:84%
man, his supposed baptism lands
on April 26, 4/26, exactly

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:84%
three days after
his supposed birth,

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:84%
which traditional for the time
was done three days earlier,

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
such that the structural center
of the Sonnets pyramid, Sonnet

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:36.470 align:middle line:84%
113 equals day 113, and
the Sonnets time map,

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and would be the
perfect day when

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.525 align:middle line:84%
England loves to be patriotic,
St. George's Day, April 23rd.

00:27:43.525 --> 00:27:46.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:52.980 align:middle line:84%
A totally made-up birthday
of the man from Stratford.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.360 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode, we'll
see even more substantiating

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
evidence building up as we learn
why so many critical clues are

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:90%
focused on the center.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.800 align:middle line:84%
For example, the center pages
of the science book, the center

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.340 align:middle line:84%
pages of the folio, even
the center of de Vere's

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.680 align:middle line:90%
own signature.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly, what
the grids in all these centers

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:23.420 align:middle line:84%
tell us has been hidden in
one particular location,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.850 align:middle line:90%
The Holy of Holies altar stone.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.900 align:middle line:90%
