>> We've seen Whitfield Diffie's
system for sending a secure

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:10%
code across a distance.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.310 align:middle line:84%
We've also seen
John Dee's system

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
for sending a secure
code across time.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And deep down, their
concepts turn out

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:10%
to be the same, which
shouldn't really

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.420 align:middle line:10%
be a surprise because
distance and time, according

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.020 align:middle line:10%
to Einstein, are
essentially the same thing.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Space, time.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
Diffie's invention caused
a paradigm shift that

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.360 align:middle line:90%
literally changed the world.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Dee's invention,
once recognized,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to cause
a similar paradigm

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.800 align:middle line:84%
shift in the world's perception
of who Shakespeare really was.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Sure, right now when
we hear his name,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.800 align:middle line:84%
we don't think science or
astronomical equations.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:84%
We think plays
and poetry, right?

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Yet his plays and poetry are
actually full of references

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
to stars, moon, sun,
comets, eclipses.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.350 align:middle line:84%
We've just assumed
for four centuries

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that he's only using
those words poetically.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:90%
But what if that's not the case?

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
Why on Earth would Edward
de Vere, the Earl of Oxford,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called just
Oxford for short,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
go to the trouble of enlisting
his friend, John Dee,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:84%
greatest cryptographer
at the time,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:84%
to devise such a mathematically
elegant system of sending

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.170 align:middle line:90%
a secret message to posterity?

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.540 align:middle line:90%
To us?

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Why not just write it
on a piece of parchment,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.760 align:middle line:84%
sign it, tape it to the
underside of the altar?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
It will still be
found eventually.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:84%
No need to jump through
all these hoops.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Unless the numbers themselves
and the patterns they form

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
are as important as
the inner message

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.360 align:middle line:90%
they are wrapped around.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physicists
today are verifying

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.520 align:middle line:84%
what the ancient philosophers
have always said.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.130 align:middle line:10%
On the surface it looks like
we live in a world made up

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.940 align:middle line:10%
of all these different
elements, but deep down,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:10%
hydrogen, helium, lithium,
beryllium, boron, carbon,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:10%
nitrogen, oxygen, they're
just different numbers

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.230 align:middle line:10%
of electrons, combinations
of the same one thing,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:10%
that elusive God Particle.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.250 align:middle line:10%
Isn't that what Shakespeare's
saying in "The Tempest,"

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:10%
"We are such stuff as
dreams are made of?"

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.480 align:middle line:84%
And in "Twelfth Night" when
he has a drunkard and a clown

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.120 align:middle line:90%
say four times, "It's all one."

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:90%
The message is the code.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And the question
should not really

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.030 align:middle line:84%
be, who was Shakespeare,
but what was he,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
she, they, whoever this
mysterious entity was?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're presently a
believer in the Stratford story

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
or are already curious
about the alternatives,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:84%
I should warn you,
it's even bigger

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
than anything either
side has yet to imagine.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And our preconceptions
about the writer,

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
that small screen
black-and-white grainy

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.430 align:middle line:84%
film that's playing in our
collective consciousness

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.600 align:middle line:84%
right now, is about to explode
into widescreen technicolor

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.170 align:middle line:84%
surround sound like that
moment in "Wizard of Oz"

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:90%
that changed cinema forever.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Because in this story, there's
a real wizard, Dr. John Dee.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:10%
He was the leading mathematician
and cryptographer of the age,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:10%
astronomer, navigator,
Hebrew expert,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.990 align:middle line:10%
Queen Elizabeth's astrologer,
and super spy in Europe,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.130 align:middle line:10%
code number 007.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.130 align:middle line:84%
He documented years
of seances in which he

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:90%
was conversing with angels.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:84%
Now whether they were what
we today think of as angels,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.144 align:middle line:84%
or, let's say, extradimensional
beings, whatever they were,

00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:31.160 align:middle line:84%
they certainly were helping
Dee with his mission

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.640 align:middle line:84%
to create a cryptographic
masterpiece whose purpose was

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:84%
to hide the true
story of the greatest

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
cover-up in literary
history and pass it on

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:84%
securely across time
so that it could

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
be revealed once the world
was ready to fully receive it.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:90%
And that time is now.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.700 align:middle line:84%
The secret has been
decoded, and I assure you,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.640 align:middle line:84%
you'll never think of
the artist formerly known

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:84%
as Shakespeare in quite
the same way ever again.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.495 align:middle line:90%
The game is afoot.

00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.440 align:middle line:10%
I was first introduced to this
Dee rabbit hole by a friend,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:10%
Michael Dunn, who invited
me to his one-man show,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:10%
"Sherlock Holmes Solves
the Shakespeare Mystery."

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:10%
He grew up in a
nearly bookless town

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:10%
as the son of parents who
could neither read nor write.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:10%
For that matter, he
never taught his children

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:10%
to read or write either.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.450 align:middle line:84%
I went, as one does, to
support a friend, but really

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.500 align:middle line:90%
reluctantly.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.180 align:middle line:84%
My whole life, I had never had
the least interest in the man

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:90%
we English call The Bard.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:10%
It just means poet, but
in England, he's The Poet.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Like many people, I had a
block about the costumes

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and the arcane language
and how they all

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:84%
speak as though they have
hot potatoes in their mouths.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.910 align:middle line:10%
Nevertheless, I went to
my friend's performance,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:10%
and within the
first few minutes,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:10%
I was utterly
hooked by that list

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.600 align:middle line:10%
of anomalies we were
never told about

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.090 align:middle line:10%
and the obvious
cover-up they implied.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I knew immediately this was the
story I had been waiting for.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200 align:middle line:90%
I had to write it as a musical.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I figured I'd spend a
year researching, writing,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.960 align:middle line:90%
18 months tops.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:84%
But the more I learned,
the deeper the story

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:84%
grew until it
couldn't be contained

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
within one singular,
sensational, theatrical

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.300 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.910 align:middle line:84%
It needed to be a novel, a
trilogy, part-historical drama,

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
part-modern day
espionage thriller.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I had the whole story mapped
out right up to the final scene

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.340 align:middle line:84%
where my heroine
solves a bunch of codes

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
and wraps up the whole mystery
with a big red bow-- ta-da!

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
But at the time I knew nothing
about Renaissance codes

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and I figured, well, I
should at least read up

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:84%
on how they actually
did codes back then.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So while I was at it, I decided
to go to Stratford and see

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:90%
the church for myself.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So I did the tour,
took some pictures,

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.160 align:middle line:84%
came back home with a rubbing
of Shakespeare's gravestone,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:90%
stuck it on my wall.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And all the while, furiously
reading up on John Dee,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:90%
he's this master cryptographer.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.530 align:middle line:10%
He used a grid method
called Equidistant Letter

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.630 align:middle line:10%
Sequencing or ELS.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:10%
It's a system that puts the
letters of a text into a grid

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.030 align:middle line:10%
so it then reveals hidden
messages vertically.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
I happened to compare
the rubbing I'd

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:84%
bought with photos that I'd
taken of the actual gravestone

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.280 align:middle line:90%
and I noticed a problem.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.780 align:middle line:10%
The rubbing had only a period
where the actual gravestone

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.085 align:middle line:10%
had a comma.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It'd turn out, I had
stumbled quite by accident

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:58.250 align:middle line:84%
upon something no biography of
Dee seems to have ever noticed,

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:84%
that he expanded
on the ELS system

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:84%
by creating grids that could
give one solution by excluding

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.680 align:middle line:84%
punctuation and another by
including punctuation, and more

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.640 align:middle line:84%
amazing yet, they
complemented each other.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
This revelation, brought
about by the missing

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
dot on the rubbing,
literally shook my world

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and opened up almost two
decades so far of stunning codes

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and solutions, and I'm really
excited to share it with you.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
is you need a sense

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
of the layout of the church
and where the key touchstones

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:84%
are that we'll be looking at
in detail to solve the puzzle.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
This picture was taken during
dress rehearsal for the music

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:84%
concert I gave at
the Stratford Church.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare's gravestone
is right behind the piano.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Its text is cryptic.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
It's heavily
suggesting a cipher.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't even have
Shakespeare's name on it.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.060 align:middle line:90%
That's touchstone number one.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare's monument is
on the wall above my head.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.910 align:middle line:10%
Its text is even more
suggestive of a code.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:10%
The Latin lines are
grammatically wrong.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:10%
The English hardly
makes any sense at all.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's touchstone number two.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And a few yards behind me is
the Holy of Holies altar stone.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:90%
It, too, is very suspicious.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But hey, I brought
it back with me

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:90%
so you could see for yourself.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Just kidding.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's go have a look at it.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:10%
Every consecrated
Catholic altar stone

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.960 align:middle line:10%
has to have five
crosses on its surface

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:10%
representing Christ's
stigmata wounds.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:10%
When I first examined the
one in Shakespeare's church,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.760 align:middle line:10%
I saw it had only three.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:10%
But I also discovered a false
cross of a different size

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:10%
and style cut into the
front side of the stone that

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:10%
should not be there.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So right away there's a
lot of mystery surrounding

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.650 align:middle line:90%
this 800-year-old holy relic.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Not least of which
is the fact it

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
was not even there during
Shakespeare's lifetime.

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:84%
It had been hidden deep
in the church catacombs

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.470 align:middle line:84%
at the start of Henry
VIII's Reformation.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:10%
The ancient entrance
to the catacombs

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.030 align:middle line:10%
is still marked by a
cross on this flagstone

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.830 align:middle line:10%
outside the church.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:10%
We don't know how far
these medieval tunnels

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:32.550 align:middle line:10%
go underground-- they could
be anywhere within this area,

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.640 align:middle line:10%
but we do know the altar
stone was not found deep

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.220 align:middle line:10%
in those ancient
crumbling tunnels,

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:10%
but just inches below the
stone slab flooring here

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:10%
in 1889, hidden beneath
someone else's altar

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.700 align:middle line:10%
tomb in the south
cross aisle transept.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
Clearly it had been
deliberately moved

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:84%
from the hard-to-access
tunnels to a place where

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:84%
they knew it would easily be
found eventually, which it was.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.510 align:middle line:84%
They cleaned it
up, reinstated it

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
in the most sacred spot in
the church where we see it

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.190 align:middle line:84%
today, next to the gravestone
and the monument and my piano.

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:84%
The solution I showed
Diffie states clearly,

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
this altar stone is where
Shakespeare has left the answer

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
to the puzzle, which, of course,
was why I was there that day

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.490 align:middle line:84%
setting up this huge banner to
obscure the view of the altar

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.890 align:middle line:90%
as we prepared to radar scan it.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But we're getting
ahead of ourselves.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.320 align:middle line:84%
In order to fully comprehend
the codes you're about to see,

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.670 align:middle line:84%
we need to refresh our memories
as to what happened on Mt.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Sinai nearly 3 and 1/2
thousand years ago.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:90%
Cast your minds back.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
After the Lord speaks to Moses
from the burning bush telling

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
him to deliver a
message to the elders,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Moses asks, "Who
shall I say sent me?"

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord answers,
Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh,

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:09.630 align:middle line:84%
which translates as,
"I am that I am."

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the first time in the
Bible that the name of God

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.050 align:middle line:90%
is revealed by the Lord himself.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Each word starts with the first
letter of the Hebrew alphabet,

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
aleph, and in a
simple cipher that

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.460 align:middle line:84%
was well-known during
Shakespeare's day,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.290 align:middle line:84%
the alphabet is revolved so
that the first letter, aleph,

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
becomes the last letter,
tav, mimicking what Christ

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.970 align:middle line:84%
said in Hebrew, "I am the
aleph tav," the beginning

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:90%
and the end.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Thus, the three alephs
become three tavs,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and their Greek
equivalent, three towers.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:84%
These three letters were adopted
by Royal Arch Freemasonry

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:90%
and are known as the Triple Tau.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:55.650 align:middle line:84%
They allude to the three crosses
at Calvary which, as we know,

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:90%
were just simple tau crosses.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
The three Ts were compressed
into a symbol wherein

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.790 align:middle line:84%
all are joined at the base
and surrounded by the shape

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:84%
we know today as
the Star of David,

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.790 align:middle line:84%
but which was originally
Seal of Solomon.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.390 align:middle line:84%
The connected Ts
also resemble a T-H,

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.750 align:middle line:84%
which, for Freemasons,
holds three sacred meanings

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:90%
represented by Latin phrases.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.960 align:middle line:10%
Keys to the treasure, place
where the precious thing

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:10%
is concealed, and First Temple
of Jerusalem, Solomon's Temple.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:37.750 align:middle line:10%
Do you see a Triple Tau symbol
anywhere on the gravestone?

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:10%
It's not even encoded, it's
right there in plain sight

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.790 align:middle line:10%
under the name Jesus.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.980 align:middle line:10%
These Ys are printer's thorns,
an old English shortcut

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.340 align:middle line:10%
for the letters T-H.
So these lines actually

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:10%
read, "Blessed be the man
that spares these stones

00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.640 align:middle line:10%
and cursed be he
that moves my bones."

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.280 align:middle line:10%
What about actual T-H letters?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's one on
each side, but they're

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.560 align:middle line:10%
not separate T and H letters.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.650 align:middle line:10%
They're connected just
like the Triple Tau symbol.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.080 align:middle line:10%
Printers call this a ligature.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.440 align:middle line:10%
So altogether,
including the Y thorns,

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:10%
the gravestone has five T-Hs
representing the five stigmata

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:10%
wounds of Christ.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Are there any T-Hs
in the monument?

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.950 align:middle line:84%
There are 10 and every
pair is ligature, once

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
again mimicking that
Triple Tau symbol.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:84%
But there's also another
pair of unusual ligatures,

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:84%
N-E and M-E. So
what is it saying?

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.580 align:middle line:84%
"I am that I am,"
me, but all caps.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:90%
Important distinction.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:90%
The real self me.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Notice the T-Hs are
in two distinct groups

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
of four and six, so
there's a pattern

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.350 align:middle line:84%
of groups reading four
to six, left to right,

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:10.060 align:middle line:84%
or six to four, read
backwards Hebraic fashion.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have Freemasonic T-H
ligatures in the gravestone

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and in the monument,
both of which

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.220 align:middle line:84%
have cryptic text
suggesting a cipher.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to look far to
find touchstone number three.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It's the dedication page of
Shakespeare's sonnets, which

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:90%
is all extremely cryptic text.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Notice, first of
all, it's structured

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.150 align:middle line:84%
as three inverted triangles
of six lines, two lines, four

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.020 align:middle line:90%
lines.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
Same pattern as the
monument ligatures.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
In 1997, the late Oxfordian
scholar, John Rollett,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.260 align:middle line:84%
was the first to
notice that if you

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Count the sixth word, the
second, the fourth, and so on--

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:57.300 align:middle line:84%
6, 2, 4, 6, 2, it
reveals a sentence.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.820 align:middle line:84%
These sonnets all by
ever the fourth T. "Ever"

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
was an obvious anagram of
"vere," suggesting the leading

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.080 align:middle line:84%
alternate Shakespeare
candidate, Edward de Vere 17th

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Earl of Oxford, whose name also
contains the 6-2-4 pattern.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But Rollett couldn't figure
out what the fourth T meant

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
and he abandoned the search.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:10%
In 2002, another Oxfordian
scholar, Art Neuendorffer,

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.060 align:middle line:10%
thought that since the three
T crosses represent Calvary,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:10%
the fourth T might mean
the fourth tau cross,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:10%
the fourth person crucified
after Calvary in Christ's name,

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.670 align:middle line:10%
and that was St. Peter
who asked to be crucified

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:10%
upside-down saying, he
was not worthy of dying

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:10%
the same way as his Lord.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Neuendorffer suspected an ELS
grid might reveal an answer

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and used the standard
method excluding punctuation

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:90%
that works like this.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Just flow the first 10
letters in, and then the next,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:84%
You could do this with any
grid you wish of course.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:10%
This is a five-grid,
this is a 14.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:13.710 align:middle line:10%
He tried a 19-grid and found a
triple tau with an inverted tau

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:10%
cross next to it spelling
the name "De Vere."

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:84%
A very promising
start that seemed

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to support Rollett's
discovery and confirm

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
"Vere," the Earl of Oxford,
as the author of the sonnets.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Strangely, neither
he nor Rollett

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:90%
followed up any further.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:10%
But I saw their work shortly
after I started researching

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:10%
John Dee and that helped me find
something even deeper in it,

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.500 align:middle line:10%
because in Dee's great
cryptologic masterpiece,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:10%
the "Monas Hieroglyphica,"
he clearly tells us he uses

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:10%
punctuation-- dots--

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.200 align:middle line:10%
as part of his
unique coding method.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.310 align:middle line:10%
He states, "In it there be
not even one superfluous dot

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:10%
and not one dot wanting."

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.730 align:middle line:10%
So the fact that every word
in the sonnet's dedication

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:08.730 align:middle line:10%
is followed by a dot told me,
this had to be Dee's work.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:10%
I started by looking for other
occurrences of the Triple Tau

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:10%
and Vere inverted cross.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.790 align:middle line:10%
I put the gravestone text
into every possible grid

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:10%
and discovered
there's only one where

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.090 align:middle line:10%
you find a triple tau next to
an inverted tau cross spelling

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:29.028 align:middle line:10%
the name Veres, as
in belonging to Vere.

00:18:29.028 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:84%
I did the same with
the monument text

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and found there's only one there
that has a triple tau balanced

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
against an inverted tau cross
spelling E Vere for Edward.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:10%
So it looked like I
was onto something.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:10%
It had the consistency of a
definite repetitive system.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:10%
I dove deeper into
the gravestone.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Besides the triple
tau and Vere's cross,

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
I saw ears and eyes
perfectly balanced

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:84%
against each other like
Freemasonic T squares.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's Queen
Elizabeth in one

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.720 align:middle line:84%
of her favorite gowns
covered in ears and eyes.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.870 align:middle line:84%
She's basically telling the
world, don't mess with me,

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:90%
I've got my spies everywhere.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, Elizabeth's chief
spy in Europe was Dee.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.980 align:middle line:84%
He was literally the ears
and eyes of Her Majesty.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But he's gone even
further and actually

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.060 align:middle line:84%
signed his work
with two pillars,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.510 align:middle line:84%
like the Boaz and Jachin pillars
at the entrance to Solomon's

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Temple, Dee and Dee.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:10%
But here's the kicker.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.510 align:middle line:10%
His code number,
007, how brilliant!

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:43.410 align:middle line:10%
O-O-DEE in the
shape of a number 7.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to see a lot
more of these signatures

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and his great sense of
humor, but there's more.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:84%
Dee was communing
with angels in seances

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
for over a decade in
England and Europe.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.090 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
of those sessions

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
took place in Krakow,
Poland in 1584.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.780 align:middle line:84%
A coded transmission
was delivered to Dee

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:84%
during a long session that
started on June 24, 624.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.040 align:middle line:10%
The angels gave
precise instructions

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:10%
to put all the letters into four
quadrants, and as you can see,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:10%
Dee marked the grid himself.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.830 align:middle line:10%
There are precisely 624 spaces.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:10%
The document is called
The Enochian Tables,

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.080 align:middle line:10%
and of course, it's
the private red key

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:10%
that you saw in the
previous episode.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:10%
And the public yellow
key was the three grids

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:42.830 align:middle line:10%
I've just shown you.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.020 align:middle line:90%
So let's recap.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Dee created three
separate grids.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Sonnets' dedication,
monument, and gravestone

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:90%
all excluding punctuation.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But The Enochian Tables were
divinely inspired and uploaded

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.180 align:middle line:90%
to Dee by angelic beings.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I had a hunch he was
using dots as a way

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.420 align:middle line:84%
to create other
grids that would add

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.740 align:middle line:84%
extra meaning to
the first messages,

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:14.560 align:middle line:84%
so I counted the punctuation
and characters in all three

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.400 align:middle line:84%
to see if they led to the
next step in the puzzle.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So, Sonnets' dedication,
including all characters

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:90%
and dots, total 178.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Monument, all characters
and punctuation, 332.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.020 align:middle line:10%
Gravestone, all characters
and punctuation, 113.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Overall total, 623.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Impossible!

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:84%
If it had been out
by five or six,

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd have admitted my hunch
was wrong, but out by one?

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:90%
There had to be a mistake.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.600 align:middle line:10%
Somewhere-- and
then I realized, I

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.420 align:middle line:10%
was using the rubbing
of the gravestone which,

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.190 align:middle line:10%
of course, is wrong.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.490 align:middle line:10%
It has a single dot
instead of a colon.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.390 align:middle line:84%
This is the moment
I absolutely knew

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:90%
I got his methodology down.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.780 align:middle line:84%
Clearly he was using
the colon like a null,

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:18.940 align:middle line:84%
as a way of filling two
separate spaces when necessary.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:90%
Bingo.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:25.690 align:middle line:84%
The true total for
all three is 624.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
There couldn't be a
clearer invitation

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:32.260 align:middle line:84%
to match the 624 characters
of the three touchstones

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.680 align:middle line:84%
against the 624 characters
of The Enochian Tables.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.920 align:middle line:84%
However, just laying
them over each other

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.480 align:middle line:90%
is only the first step.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
You need a master key to
know what points to what.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I looked deeper into
Royal Arch Masonry

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:84%
and I discovered
that members are

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.720 align:middle line:84%
awarded this
Companion's Jewel when

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:90%
they reach a certain level.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:10%
It's a Seal of Solomon again
within a circle of gold,

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:10%
and at the bottom is a Latin
phrase, "Nil nisi clavis

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.730 align:middle line:10%
deest," which means, "Nothing
is wanting but the key."

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And the key, of course, is
the T-H symbol in the center.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.380 align:middle line:84%
The Sonnets'
dedication is signed,

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.460 align:middle line:84%
T. T., the initials of the
publisher, Thomas Thorpe,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.290 align:middle line:84%
but of course, that's a
clue hiding in plain sight,

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.300 align:middle line:90%
He's really Th-omas Th-orpe.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:30.200 align:middle line:84%
T-H, T-H. The master
key is, in fact,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.160 align:middle line:90%
the double T of his sign-off.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And there are just five
sets of the double Ts

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:84%
that point across from
the Sonnets' dedication,

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.940 align:middle line:84%
gravestone, and monument, to the
letters in The Enochian Tables

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:90%
that reveal a message--

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.370 align:middle line:90%
"living page."

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
But the part that
shocked Diffie was

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that the master key, five
sets of double T's, is also

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
in The Enochian Tables.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is where to fully
comprehend the system,

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:05.710 align:middle line:84%
it can take 18 years because
you don't suspect at first

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.310 align:middle line:84%
that it's going to be much more
than just a new and improved

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.260 align:middle line:90%
ELS system.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:90%
But it's so much more.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.420 align:middle line:84%
It migrates across all
Shakespeare's works

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.430 align:middle line:84%
because he can't
resist putting clues

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:84%
into seemingly unrelated
scenes in the plays.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.280 align:middle line:84%
You end up having
to read them all

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that it's always
little moments, usually

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:84%
comedic, that seem
to have nothing

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.650 align:middle line:90%
to do with the main storyline.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Like he's just
putting in a slapstick

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.330 align:middle line:84%
routine for a
little light relief.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But they're always
secret hidden references

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.590 align:middle line:84%
to the overall bigger puzzle
of the Shakespeare mystery.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.550 align:middle line:84%
One such scene is where
Malvolio in "Twelfth Night"

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
is reading a letter
that contains a code.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:10%
It occurs at the
very top of page 264

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.540 align:middle line:10%
where we read,
"No man must know.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:10%
No man must know.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.840 align:middle line:10%
What follows?

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.670 align:middle line:10%
The numbers altered.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.400 align:middle line:10%
No man must know."

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.430 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough, you look
across and the number

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.900 align:middle line:10%
has been altered.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.780 align:middle line:10%
273 instead of 265.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:18.070 align:middle line:10%
Further down he reads,
"M.O.A.I. doth sway my life,"

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.430 align:middle line:10%
and does some juggling of the
letters which he observes all

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.590 align:middle line:10%
occur in his own name.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a subtle nod
to Juliet's "What's

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.440 align:middle line:84%
in a name" because he sees
it as a partial anagram

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
of his own name but he
just can't work it out.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's never
solved in the play.

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to be
solved by us in the bigger

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:41.020 align:middle line:90%
play within the play.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Further down and drawing
attention to itself in italics,

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.850 align:middle line:10%
he reads, "If this fall
into thy hand, revolve."

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:10%
Well, if we revolve the
letters, we get I-A-O-M,

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.380 align:middle line:10%
and my good friend,
Professor Michael Delahoyde,

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.470 align:middle line:10%
who teaches Shakespeare at
Washington State University,

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:10%
pointed out to me that IAOM
is the Freemasons' most sacred

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.660 align:middle line:10%
password given only
under strictest secrecy.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I remember thinking, could
it really be that simple?

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It's page 264, after
all, the nearest

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.590 align:middle line:84%
he can get to a page 624 or 426
as the sections in the folio

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.570 align:middle line:90%
don't go that high.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Are we supposed to just
revolve The Enochian Tables?

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, turns out,
that's exactly what

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:90%
we're being instructed to do.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And now the double
T's in both directions

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.790 align:middle line:84%
are pointing to completely
different letters,

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.350 align:middle line:84%
but back at their
own private codes--

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Diffie colored
paint analogy again.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And when mixed together, they
give messages three and four--

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.870 align:middle line:90%
"I have hewn desiderata."

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:84%
The whole solution is a
Shakespearean rhyming couplet

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:90%
in iambic tetrameter form.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Living
page, yo stigmata,

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I have hewn desiderata."

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
In modern parlance, it
says, "As a living page,

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.750 align:middle line:90%
a preserved record kept alive."

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:16.250 align:middle line:84%
"Yo," a middle English word
that means, "Look closely at."

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.010 align:middle line:90%
"Stigmata," Christ's wounds.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:84%
There the crosses carved into
a consecrated altar stone where

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
"I have hewn," cut into
stone, "desiderata,"

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.248 align:middle line:84%
Latin for my desires,
"What I want you to know."

00:27:33.248 --> 00:27:37.070 align:middle line:84%
All of which points
us to the altar stone

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:41.120 align:middle line:90%
known as the Holy of Holies.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.970 align:middle line:84%
We've seen the Seal of
Solomon now in two places.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Why are we being led
to Solomon's Temple

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.090 align:middle line:90%
and the Holy of Holies?

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Here's the temple layout.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.550 align:middle line:10%
Remember, Solomon's Temple,
keys to the treasure,

00:27:55.550 --> 00:28:00.380 align:middle line:10%
place where the precious
thing is concealed, all T-Hs.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.250 align:middle line:10%
So the place where the
precious thing is concealed,

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:09.290 align:middle line:10%
the Ark is the Holy of Holies.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:17.410 align:middle line:10%
And the Hebrew word for
it is pronounced D'Vere,

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:23.540 align:middle line:10%
from the root word, "devarim,"
which means "words."

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:29.320 align:middle line:84%
So when Polonius asks Hamlet,
"What you read, my Lord?"

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And Hamlet, feigning
madness, says, "Words.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.610 align:middle line:10%
Words.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.120 align:middle line:10%
Words."

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:84%
He's actually telling us the
root of his name, D'Vere,

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.700 align:middle line:90%
D'Vere, D'Vere.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Oxford must be
laughing his tights

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.320 align:middle line:84%
off watching this drama
unfold from wherever he is.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Talk about a play within
a play within a play.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.010 align:middle line:84%
He supposedly died
on June 24, 624--

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:07.030 align:middle line:84%
that's according to
the historical record.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:90%
Want to bet?

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
What are the odds of him dying
on the very day the codes are

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:90%
all about?

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's nowhere near as
good as the spin of a roulette

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.200 align:middle line:90%
wheel.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:24.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about 10 times
that, 365 to 1.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:28.540 align:middle line:84%
William Shakspere was
baptized on April 26, 426.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:84%
What are the odds of
him being baptized

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:84%
on the very day the
codes are all about?

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.730 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's the same, isn't it?

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.100 align:middle line:90%
365 to 1.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But the odds of
these both happening

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.610 align:middle line:84%
by sheer coincidence, the
beginning of Shakspere's life

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and the end of the real
Shakespeare's life,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.560 align:middle line:84%
you need to multiply
these together.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.820 align:middle line:90%
It's 133,000 to 1.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.850 align:middle line:84%
The Enochian Tables,
the Rosetta Stone

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:84%
for decrypting this
whole mystery so far,

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:09.230 align:middle line:84%
was delivered by angels
to Dee on June 24, 624.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And it has exactly
624 squares in it.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:84%
That's another 365
to 1 coincidence.

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.310 align:middle line:84%
Odds are now over
48 million to 1.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Figure in that Oxford
died 20 years to the day

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:84%
after the angels delivered the
very code he was told to use.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:84%
That's now over
350 trillion to 1.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:90%
I think you get the picture.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The proof is in the
magic of the math.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.550 align:middle line:90%


00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.380 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we'll explore

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.290 align:middle line:84%
some of the many
other "coincidences"

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:54.000 align:middle line:84%
of this puzzle, the mathematical
probabilities of which are just

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.060 align:middle line:90%
as extreme.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:59.580 align:middle line:84%
There is essentially zero chance
of this being coincidental.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:05.160 align:middle line:84%
These are secure messages sent
across time specifically to us.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're accompanied by even
more elegant codes that further

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.390 align:middle line:84%
confirm two brilliant
geniuses guiding us

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.920 align:middle line:84%
with a system that can only be
called a combination of math

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.970 align:middle line:90%
and poetry--

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:90%
math-o-etics.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.610 align:middle line:84%
An unheard-of level of
cryptographic sophistication

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.190 align:middle line:84%
that will ultimately
deliver us the

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:32.430 align:middle line:84%
answer to what they hid inside
this alter stone and why.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:90%
