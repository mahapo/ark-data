00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:10%
>>ALAN W. GREEN:
In this episode,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.360 align:middle line:10%
we explore the amazing fact
that Dee and de Vere, sometimes

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:10%
known as Oxford, were planning
this entire coded mystery

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:10%
for a full 30 years.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare wrote poems,
sonnets, and plays.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.390 align:middle line:10%
We're going to look
at them grouped

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:10%
from the very first time
the name William Shakespeare

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:10%
appeared in print in
1593, through to the 1609

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.850 align:middle line:10%
publication of his Sonnets,
to the final collection of 36

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:10%
of his plays in the
"First Folio" in 1623.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:10%
But what has never
been proven until now

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:10%
is that the great author also
played a significant role

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.550 align:middle line:10%
in the translation of the King
James Bible published in 1611.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.760 align:middle line:10%
But then why would
the king not call

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.380 align:middle line:10%
on the greatest
writer of the time

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:10%
right there in his own backyard?

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.150 align:middle line:84%
It ultimately became
the bestselling book

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:84%
of all time, billions
of copies in print.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And a large part
of its success is

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
that it has one cohesive,
poetic voice throughout.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Hardly the result
one would expect

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
from a committee of 54
non-writer clerics cobbling it

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.030 align:middle line:84%
together, which is
the official story.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:10%
You're going to see that
the Shakespeare Rosie Cross

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:10%
Fraternity embedded
the same coded messages

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:10%
over and over again into
all of these publications,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:10%
expressly to reveal a
royal secret so dangerous

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.900 align:middle line:10%
at the time, it simply
had to be encrypted.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.985 align:middle line:84%
Remember, nothing
that is so is so.

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:84%
It seems obvious now
given the hindsight

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
of 18 years' meticulous
and obsessive study.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, not
until recently did

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
I realize the linear periods
of research I've been doing

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.790 align:middle line:84%
had fallen into neat categories
of two central periods

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:84%
of six years bookended by
two years and four years.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm now so in the habit of
seeing patterns everywhere

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.420 align:middle line:90%
that you could say--

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
and many have--
that I'm a living

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.400 align:middle line:84%
example of self-fulfilling
confirmation bias.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:84%
It's an interesting field
of inquiry that, isn't it?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Most people who don't
believe in positive thinking

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
don't experience it,
which is probably

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.710 align:middle line:90%
why they don't believe in it.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:10%
Look, I know there is
such a thing as apophenia.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:10%
What psychologists define
as the human tendency

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.970 align:middle line:10%
to see connections and patterns
that are not really there.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.100 align:middle line:90%
But look at that definition.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.440 align:middle line:84%
In itself, a form of
confirmation bias,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
not really there.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.140 align:middle line:90%
End of conversation.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
I've heard many, many people
have had at least one,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
probably more likely
several experiences

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
where you know something
is about to happen,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
or has already, but
we usually deny it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
because the stigma attached
to even bringing it

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:90%
up with friends and family, mm.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It's worth repeating, patterns
that are not really there.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:10%
The definition itself is biased
against any other version

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:10%
of truth but theirs.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
If we allow someone to have
the authority over our own mind

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to tell us that what we
see is not in fact real.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's happening
today, isn't it?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Well then, of course, no
wonder the multibillion-dollar

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.860 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical companies
are doing just fine.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Believe me, I would not have
spent 18-plus years on this

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
if the patterns were
not real and didn't

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
adhere to a replicatable
system that's

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.300 align:middle line:90%
easy to follow once you see it.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:10%
Quite simply,
they're always to be

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:10%
found in three places within
each of these publications.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:10%
The very first page,
the very last page,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:10%
and the very center
of the structure.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Consequently, I've named this
hypothesis the Alpha Omega

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:90%
System.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you will see, it was
being followed consistently

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.490 align:middle line:84%
by Dee and Shakespeare
across a span of 30 years.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.780 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the authors knew
such redundancy would increase

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.260 align:middle line:84%
the probability of their
messages being found,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
but would also be necessary in
order for future generations

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.230 align:middle line:84%
to accept their validity because
of their innate confirmation

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.560 align:middle line:90%
bias against confirmation.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
See, one or two random
codes can easily

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:84%
be dismissed by a
skeptical public.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And I only have time,
unfortunately, here

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:90%
to show you a handful of them.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:10%
But believe me, there are
well over 150 of these, each

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:10%
repeating the same message
and the same locations

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.990 align:middle line:10%
where their claims
can be proven.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a
self-confirmatory system.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.040 align:middle line:84%
Because the probability
of intentionality

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.403 align:middle line:84%
is essentially 100%
mathematically.

00:05:45.403 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to the altar.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:10%
For a quick recap of what we've
already seen in the Sonnets,

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.780 align:middle line:10%
the first page
hides the geometry

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.210 align:middle line:10%
that reveals precise knowledge
of then unknown math constants.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.540 align:middle line:10%
The mathematical relationship
between the world's three

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.340 align:middle line:10%
major measurement systems and
incredibly accurate coordinates

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:10%
of the Great Pyramid.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
The last page of the very last
Sonnet reveals altar stone

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
finally solved, "ww
10, 01 e. vere."

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.990 align:middle line:10%
The very last lines of
"A Lover's Complaint"

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:10%
reveals "In Fine",
meaning in the end, "print

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.210 align:middle line:10%
conceals I AM Edward de Vere."

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:10%
Notice even the
letters "I AM", all

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.750 align:middle line:10%
caps in the lines
themselves because they're

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:10%
the abbreviation of the
most common translation

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:10%
of the name of God.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:10%
I AM that I AM.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's look again at Sonnet
121, where Shakespeare writes

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:90%
this astounding statement.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
"Noe, I am that I am, and
they the level at my abuses

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.700 align:middle line:90%
reckon up their own."

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Uttering the name of
God was unthinkable.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:10%
Because in 1606, King
James issued a new law

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:10%
banning the printing or
speaking of any names of God.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.750 align:middle line:84%
This was not only blasphemous
because the poet is using it

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
in the first person, but
it was treasonous too

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.890 align:middle line:84%
because the law that forbade
the use of the name of God

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.820 align:middle line:84%
was called the Act of Abuses,
and Shakespeare is blatantly

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:84%
flaunting that royal
decree by saying,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.690 align:middle line:84%
"They that level of my
abuses, reckon up their own."

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:90%
This is utterly outrageous.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:10%
And the clear proof that the
author cannot possibly have

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:10%
been the Stratford grain
dealer, there's simply no way

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:10%
a commoner could have got away
with threatening the King?

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare would
have been hung, drawn,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and quartered the day after
the Sonnets were published.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It also has huge
significance because it

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:05.380 align:middle line:84%
means Oxford had to
be still alive in 1606

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:90%
to know the name of that law.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
This is clear proof his
supposed death in 1604

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
was fixed, as the codes
have repeatedly stated.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.830 align:middle line:84%
However, in order for
this forbidden divine name

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to be complete, it
must, by definition,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:84%
include its past, present,
and future tense versions.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
We already found "I
will be what I will be"

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the folio.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:84%
Let's now check out the
center of the Sonnets book.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Indeed we find it hidden
in the catchwords again.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:10%
We have "I Was" and "I
Was", the past tense version

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.040 align:middle line:10%
of the name of God.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:10%
But Oxford goes one
better and adds "not."

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Giving us "I was and I was not."

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.090 align:middle line:84%
Thus including
all existence, all

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
non-existence, everything that's
possible to be and not to be.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.770 align:middle line:90%
It's the ultimate name of God.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And just to add
to the perfection,

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the center of the
Sonnets is divided

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
into 40 pages on the left, 40
pages on the right, de Vere's

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.560 align:middle line:90%
code number.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's look at the
center of the "First Folio."

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Recapping again, we already saw
the center words of the center

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:30.960 align:middle line:84%
pages of the folio, 100 and
101, give us the catchword code,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:90%
"I will be what I will be."

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.510 align:middle line:90%
So there you have it.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:90%
He's done all three.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.870 align:middle line:90%
"I was," "I am," "I will be."

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:10%
But even in these
six little letters,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:10%
he still managed to place a
code in the center, beginning,

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:10%
and end.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:10%
"OR," "EO," "RE," which is the
reverse of "ER," of course.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.750 align:middle line:10%
Still the same message
over and over again.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:06.050 align:middle line:10%
Am I to be just
Edward Oxenford--

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.720 align:middle line:10%
EO-- or Edward Rex--

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.600 align:middle line:10%
ER.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:17.100 align:middle line:10%
And remember, the center
is page 100 and page 101.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's look at the
first and last pages

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:90%
of the "First Folio."

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:90%
The beginning and end.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.670 align:middle line:84%
The folio is the
first page traces

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
to a cartoonish
engraving of the supposed

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.430 align:middle line:84%
author with far too
many deliberate mistakes

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:90%
to mention here.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.760 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
look at one for now.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's turn
to the last page,

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
which has an enormous seeming
mistake that academics think

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:90%
really is a printing error.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
The final numbering
goes from 398 to 993.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, it should be 399.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But as you saw already,
Malvolio in "Twelfth Night"

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.890 align:middle line:84%
reveals that all the
codes work both ways,

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.630 align:middle line:90%
forwards and backwards.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:90%
Revolved, be opposite.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is indeed a
mirror image of itself.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:90%
Going back to the engraving now.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Note, his jacket is half of
a front and half of a back.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But those are thinly veiled
letters, aren't they?

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:90%
"I" and "C."

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the ribbon down
the center is another "I."

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.090 align:middle line:84%
In a simple alphabet
code called gematria,

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I is the ninth letter of the
alphabet, C is the third.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:43.030 align:middle line:90%
So oh, 993.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Perfect balance,
beginning and end.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.340 align:middle line:90%
But there's more.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
The jump from the expected
399 to 993 is plus 594.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, hold that thought.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:04.320 align:middle line:84%
We're going to come
back to that, 594.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.540 align:middle line:10%
Remember, this is the last page
of the last play in his last

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.230 align:middle line:10%
ever publication, the folio.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's go back to his first
ever publication 30 years

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:23.080 align:middle line:90%
prior, Venus and Adonis, 1593.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.400 align:middle line:84%
The first time the world saw
the name William Shakespeare.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
This is one stanza of
the poem, and each stanza

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:90%
consists of six lines.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle line:84%
Here's the entire
structure: 594 lines

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:84%
to the left of center, 594
lines to the right of center.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And the very center stanza
itself is number 100.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.330 align:middle line:84%
So far, we've counted
lines and numbers.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
How do we keep track
of biblical passages?

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.660 align:middle line:90%
Chapter and verse, isn't it?

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Line and number.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.840 align:middle line:84%
He must be wanting us to count
chapters and verses as well.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:10%
Back to the Sonnets a moment.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.920 align:middle line:10%
We've already seen Dee and
de Vere place key words

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:10%
into certain sonnet
numbers to reveal

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:10%
very important math,
like, for instance,

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:10%
encoding the speed of light.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:90%
That was kind of important.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:84%
On the left, the numbers
of the sonnets that

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
contain the word
you're searching

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
on, multiply by the Shakespeare
equation, 123 times pi over 6,

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.360 align:middle line:84%
and the solution
will be on the right.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's check where he uses
the word verse or verses.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:90%
This is Sonnet number 17.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:10%
So count 17, then 19.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
I won't show them all,
they'll be listed here.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.780 align:middle line:10%
After number 81, he
starts doing doubles.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.250 align:middle line:10%
So 86 is doubled,
103 is doubled, 109,

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.630 align:middle line:10%
he gives a huge clue by
making universe capitalized

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.090 align:middle line:10%
with "all thy sum"
right above it,

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.800 align:middle line:10%
a hint to include Sonnet 126,
which has two parentheses that

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.920 align:middle line:10%
serve to represent missing
lines, missing verses,

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:10%
missing stanzas in
various other codes.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
But above all, it signifies a
joining together of two halves

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.790 align:middle line:84%
in the pyramid
structure, and that's

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.700 align:middle line:90%
exactly what it does here.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.540 align:middle line:90%
Add up the first half, 594.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.350 align:middle line:90%
Add up the second half, 594.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is obviously
deliberate and significant.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.760 align:middle line:10%
And I promised you proof of
Shakespeare's involvement

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.350 align:middle line:10%
in the King James Bible,
so let's have a look at it.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
This is about as simple
and elegant as it gets.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.000 align:middle line:84%
Here's the first page
of the King James Bible.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Here's the last.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
very center chapter

00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:00.210 align:middle line:84%
in the entire Old and
New Testament structure.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
It's also the shortest chapter
in the Bible, just two verses,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.760 align:middle line:84%
matching the two verse lines
that are missing in Sonnet 126,

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
which we just saw divides two
sections through the middle.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:90%
But here's the kicker.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:84%
It sits precisely in the
middle of the whole Bible

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:27.270 align:middle line:84%
with 594 chapters on the left
and 594 chapters on the right.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:10%
Shakespeare is very
deliberately drawing parallels

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.340 align:middle line:10%
between all his major works
and the King James Bible,

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:10%
which wasn't
published until 1611,

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.660 align:middle line:10%
two years after the Sonnets,
long after Venus and Adonis,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:10%
but also long before
the "First Folio."

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.990 align:middle line:10%
Going now to the center
of the King James Bible.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Psalm 117 had been changed to
Psalm 116 in the Latin Vulgate

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
translation, which was decreed
at the Council of Trent

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:06.270 align:middle line:84%
to be the official Bible text
of the Roman Catholic Church.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.020 align:middle line:84%
As such, the mathematical
perfection of the real Psalm

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.190 align:middle line:84%
117, being both the center
chapter of the Bible,

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.510 align:middle line:84%
as well as the shortest
chapter, was completely ruined.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Along with the proper balance
of 594 chapters on either side.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:10%
Similarly, Psalm 119
on the very next page,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.640 align:middle line:10%
which happens to be the
longest chapter of the Bible,

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.930 align:middle line:10%
became Psalm 118.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:38.190 align:middle line:10%
So along come Dee and de
Vere with a righteous mandate

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:10%
to restore the
mathoetical perfection,

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:10%
and they change all
the Psalm numbering

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:10%
back to match the
original Hebrew text.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:10%
Perfection restored.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.490 align:middle line:10%
So now consider the
subtle nudge nudge,

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:10%
wink wink to the similarly
brilliant subterfuge going on

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:10%
in the Sonnets, where
the only incorrectly

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:07.770 align:middle line:10%
numbered sonnet is this
one, printed as Sonnet 119.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.119 align:middle line:10%
But really, it's Sonnet 116.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:15.119 align:middle line:10%
As we saw previously,
the last two lines

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:10%
tell us this is not an error.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:10%
It's a clue.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:10%
Because day 116 in the Sonnet's
Calendar is April 26, 4-26.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:10%
But it's fixed to be the mirror
image code of June 24, 6-24.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.730 align:middle line:10%
What they're subtly
saying here is

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:38.340 align:middle line:10%
Psalm or Sonnet 116, the
shortest story on record,

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.470 align:middle line:10%
is Shakespeare.

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:46.050 align:middle line:10%
And it's been changed to Sonnet
or Psalm 119, the longest story

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:10%
imaginable, that of
de Vere and others

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.610 align:middle line:10%
within the Rosicrucian
fraternity.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.700 align:middle line:10%
But as always, for this
pattern to be truly consistent

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.260 align:middle line:10%
and follow the meticulous
attention to detail,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:10%
that is the Dee-de
Vere trademark,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.570 align:middle line:10%
it ought to have a mirror image.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.710 align:middle line:84%
So we must return to the
folio where we found it

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:90%
in the last wrong page number.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.560 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
A jump forward of plus 594 gave
us the 993 mirror image of 399.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
But to prove this
mirror thesis, we

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:30.500 align:middle line:84%
must go backwards
594 pages from here.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:33.560 align:middle line:10%
And we see at the
bottom of that page

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.160 align:middle line:10%
a curious song in
"The Winter's Tale"

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.570 align:middle line:10%
with three telltale
signs that it's a code.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The T in exit has been dropped
about half a line space.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:51.140 align:middle line:84%
The song starts, "Will you buy
any Tape or lace for your Cape?

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's not
an A. It's an R.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
The song ends at another
letter that should be an A.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.580 align:middle line:84%
But it's a mirror image
view of a capital R.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.240 align:middle line:84%
This would have to have been
a purposely created character

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.010 align:middle line:90%
for the Gutenberg Press.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:16.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of work for just
one letter to look wrong.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:84%
We obviously must
put it into a grid.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, I've
been true to the changes.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:84%
R here, R here revolved,
and the deliberately

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.500 align:middle line:84%
dropped T is drawing attention
to a triple tau at the corner.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Right away we see
the obvious intention

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
is to line up 20 by 10 and
have two perfect centers.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Just as the grid for
"I will find my truth

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
is hid" had two centers
dependent on each other.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Each section spells
out a location.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:10%
WSW T Isle, the west
southwest cross aisle.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:84%
We saw how Shakespeare's
grave, monument, and altar

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
form a perfect geometric
construction pointing

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:11.430 align:middle line:84%
to Richard Hill's altar tomb
in the south cross aisle.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:84%
But if we check the
actual compass orientation

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:84%
of the church, we
see the location

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:22.800 align:middle line:84%
of Hill's tomb from the altar
is closer to west southwest.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Back to the grid.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:84%
What do we see placed
precisely under the center

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:84%
codes in a horizontal
cross formation?

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:90%
The altar.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And now we see the brilliance
in him turning this A

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:90%
into an R. Encrypted by Dee.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.560 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as a pure
anagram, it reads

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:84%
"Dee encrypt", which is exactly
what this is challenging

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
us to do, decrypt the
triple tau altar that's

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
hidden under the west
southwest cross aisle.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And now we see why they
went to all that trouble

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to make a special character
for that revolve R. "I ER Rex."

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:18.110 align:middle line:84%
But not really because
the R is turned around.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.800 align:middle line:84%
He's drawing attention
to the ultimate question

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.260 align:middle line:84%
of his relationship with
the Queen politically,

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
whether Edward de Vere was to
be or not to be, E Rex the King.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.080 align:middle line:90%
His ER has been turned around.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.420 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, the answer is no.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:90%
He's not to be E Rex the King.

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And of course, history
bears that out.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And in case you still
have lingering doubts,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:52.585 align:middle line:84%
wrapped completely around
the altar is the name Edward.

00:21:52.585 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.260 align:middle line:90%
This is why the T is lowered.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:00.470 align:middle line:84%
He's finally become
the fourth T,

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
the inverted tau
cross sacrificed.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.920 align:middle line:90%
Just like Saint Peter, unworthy.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.200 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.720 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
we're going to be looking

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
at the very last
sentence of the very

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:84%
last play in the folio,
which, as we've just seen,

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.420 align:middle line:84%
has the last wrong
page number in it.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Where is all this leading?

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:84%
To the biggest secret in the
whole Shakespeare mystery.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:90%
