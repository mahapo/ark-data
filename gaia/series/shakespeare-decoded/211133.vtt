>> We know now that
the structural center

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.950 align:middle line:10%
of the Sonnets is April 23rd.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.140 align:middle line:10%
So in order for
Shakespeare's birthday

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:10%
to land precisely
in the center, it

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.210 align:middle line:10%
had to be specifically chosen to
be that day, which just happens

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.240 align:middle line:10%
to be St. George's
Day, the slayer

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.540 align:middle line:10%
of the dragon of delusion.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:10%
Given this precise
planning, one would

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:10%
expect the center
sonnet number 113

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.620 align:middle line:10%
to be very British
and patriotic.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:10%
But, no, it's celebrating
Egypt's most central

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:10%
religious myth,
the eye of Horus.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:10%
"Since I left you, mine eye is
in my mind, is partly blind.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.860 align:middle line:10%
Seems seeing, but
effectually is out."

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Horus is depicted as a falcon,
the world's fastest bird who

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:84%
can see his prey
a mile away, thus

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.350 align:middle line:84%
he's represented by the
single all-seeing eye of God.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.540 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, he
has two eyes, the sun

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:84%
and the moon inherited
from his father Osiris,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.610 align:middle line:84%
the god of the afterlife
associated with the sun,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and his mother Isis, the
virgin queen goddess associated

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.670 align:middle line:90%
with the moon.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Osiris' brother Set is the
god of chaos and disorder.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
He represents the concept of
Maya, the magic trick that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.060 align:middle line:84%
divides unity consciousness
into an infinity of seemingly

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.400 align:middle line:90%
separate entities.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.680 align:middle line:90%
That would be us.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.160 align:middle line:84%
He kills Osiris to
usurp his throne,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.050 align:middle line:84%
to gain dominion over creation
by cutting him into 14 pieces,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
but he's really
just doing his job,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.410 align:middle line:84%
dividing the one
into many, fractals

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.290 align:middle line:84%
of the unity who
as a consequence

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:90%
think we're all different.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the only way
the universe can

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.200 align:middle line:84%
have a drama is if our divine
eye is temporarily blinded

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and we see with two eyes of
earthly vision, seems seeing,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
but a true sight
effectually is out.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.860 align:middle line:10%
Horus' destiny is to
do battle with Set

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:10%
and avenge his father's murder.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.280 align:middle line:10%
But it's actually the destiny
of each and every one of us

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.170 align:middle line:10%
to overcome the delusion
of Maya, slay the dragon.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.480 align:middle line:10%
In one of the
contests between them,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:10%
Set plucks out Horus'
left eye, the moon,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:10%
reducing his sight even more.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:10%
This is why the Shakespeare
engraving has two right eyes.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:10%
I suspect you're
beginning to see

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:10%
by now, the broad mixture
of cultural and religious

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.890 align:middle line:10%
iconography that
Shakespeare draws on

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.210 align:middle line:10%
for dramatic purposes-- pagan,
Jewish, Catholic, Protestant,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:10%
Egyptian.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
It's his way of saying, as
he does in "Twelfth Night,"

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:90%
it's all one.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
He's never advocating for any
one belief system over another.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
He deals in miracles,
and no religion

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:90%
has a monopoly on those.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.700 align:middle line:84%
They're just manifestations
of the one universal truth.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
When Emperor Constantine
beheld his miraculous vision

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.950 align:middle line:84%
of the symbol known as
the Chi Rho Cristogram,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:84%
he saw the first two Greek
letters of the name Christ

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.250 align:middle line:84%
in a spear forming
the X and Rho.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:10%
Rho is the Greek letter R, but
it looks like a long-stemmed P.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.730 align:middle line:10%
Another version called the
Tau Rho uses a Tau cross

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:10%
T in place of the
Chi cross X just

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:10%
like Dee and de Vere favor.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:10%
Either side of the
cross, Constantine

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.339 align:middle line:10%
saw the Greek letters
Alpha and Omega

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:25.110 align:middle line:10%
representing Christ's words I am
the beginning and the end whose

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:10%
English equivalents are A and O.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:10%
The whole symbol ultimately
represents the divine unity

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:10%
of the one, the eye,
the missing eye.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
All together, a perfect anagram
of Horatio, Hamlet's most loyal

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.830 align:middle line:90%
and trusted friend.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830 align:middle line:84%
There are more things in
heaven and Earth, Horatio,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and are dreamed of
in your philosophy.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:84%
I am by no means
the first to see

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that the author is
telling his own story

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
through the dramatic
lens of Prince Hamlet.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.430 align:middle line:84%
But most scholars have missed
the Egyptian mystery school

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:84%
connections to
Freemasonic philosophy.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The Shakespeare equation
revealed the speed of light

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.800 align:middle line:84%
and the average distances of
Earth to sun and Earth to moon.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
I didn't fully
realize it until 2020,

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
but it's a
macro-cosmic reflection

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
of the micro-cosmic Horus myth
of left eye moon, right eye

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.580 align:middle line:90%
sun, third eye light.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.660 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of the puzzle
Shakespeare has left for us.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:10%
Indeed, when Hamlet says
the undiscovered country

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.610 align:middle line:10%
from whose bourn no traveler
returns puzzles the will,

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.210 align:middle line:10%
he really means revolve.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:90%
Will's the puzzle.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:84%
The Horus myth is essentially
the story of Hamlet.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:84%
In Shakespeare's version,
Prince Hamlet is Horus,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.770 align:middle line:90%
King Hamlet's ghost is Osiris.

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Queen Gertrude is Isis.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:10%
The prince's uncle Claudius
is Set, the usurping brother

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:10%
who kills King Hamlet
to become King Claudius.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.520 align:middle line:10%
But did you know that in
the late Egyptian period,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.100 align:middle line:10%
Set was depicted as a man
wearing a donkey's head mask.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:84%
So in Shakespeare's fairyland
play "A Midsummer Night's

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Dream," Set is
actually the good guy,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.940 align:middle line:84%
bottom starting to
awaken from the delusion

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.640 align:middle line:84%
of his dream of
separate existence

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:90%
into his true divine nature.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
In "Hamlet," the many Horus-Set
battles are all condensed down

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.340 align:middle line:84%
into one final sword fight,
and it's very telling

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.440 align:middle line:84%
that there are
two characters who

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:84%
don't appear in any of
the source materials

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:90%
Shakespeare used for this play.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
One is Hamlet's challenger
in the duel, Laertes.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
The other is the referee
of the contest, Osric.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Their names are totally
made-up by the poet

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.130 align:middle line:84%
to help us truly get his
autobiographical play

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:90%
within the play.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.920 align:middle line:84%
He's telling us Horus equals
Hamlet equals Oxford equals

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Shakespeare.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Osric shows up out of nowhere
just for this last scene.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.210 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.810 align:middle line:10%
Because his name is
an anagram of Rosi

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.580 align:middle line:10%
C, an abbreviation
of Rosi Cross.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And using only the
letters of Rosi,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:90%
we can make Osiris or Isis.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
As for Laertes, he's
a proxy for Claudius.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.830 align:middle line:84%
Set, who's using a poisoned
rapier to murder Hamlet.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:54.190 align:middle line:84%
His name is an
anagram of Real Set.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And Shakespeare has
him ritually kill

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
the real king,
the truly mad King

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Lear, who just like
the Earl King of Oxford

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
had three daughters,
one of whom he disowned.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a puzzle, folks.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Come on, the Hamlet
Horus Oxford king.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.640 align:middle line:84%
And Shakespeare can't
let it go, and he

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.490 align:middle line:84%
has to kill everybody
off this time except--

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%
except Osric.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:84%
The Rosicrucian
truth must survive.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And Horatio, the Tau Rho truth
that we are all the divine eye,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.150 align:middle line:90%
that must survive, too.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
One other character
we've hardly seen at all

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
but who is given the
last lines of the play

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because he gets to
be the new king,

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:84%
he's another
completely made up name

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
for the puzzle,
Fortinbras, a firstborn.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So you see the master poet
is equating the Horus myth

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.800 align:middle line:90%
with the Saint George myth.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Both are defeating Maya, Set, by
slaying the dragon of delusion.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:10%
But the most telling
metaphor by far

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:21.820 align:middle line:10%
is that if Oxford is Hamlet and
Hamlet is Horus and Horus is

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:28.030 align:middle line:10%
the child of Isis, a virgin
queen associated with the moon,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:10%
well, I'm just saying.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.830 align:middle line:84%
But to make total
sense of this, we're

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.340 align:middle line:84%
going to need to examine
one sentence spoken

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
by Polonius in
"Hamlet," and there

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
are a couple of clues we
need to understand first.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.530 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the
actual signature

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.530 align:middle line:84%
that Edward de Vere used
for most of his life.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:90%
Here are two examples of it.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.180 align:middle line:10%
Notice the first letter
of his first name

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:10%
is connected to the last
letter of his last name.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:10%
The last letter
of his first name

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.460 align:middle line:10%
is connected through
this strange symbol

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.330 align:middle line:10%
to the first letter
of his last name

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:10%
reminiscent of the revolved
Hebrew alphabet code

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:10%
that started us off
on this whole journey.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.970 align:middle line:10%
The first shall be last.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.310 align:middle line:10%
So what is this?

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.470 align:middle line:10%
It looks like two
W's joined together.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:10%
However, some Oxfordians
believe it represents a crown

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and that he's hinting
he's the true king.

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Stratfordians say, no, no.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.080 align:middle line:90%
It's just a coronet.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.180 align:middle line:90%
What's the difference?

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you asked.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.160 align:middle line:10%
Coronets are reserved for
certain ranks of nobility--

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:10%
earls, lords, and ladies--
and, of course, Lord de Vere,

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:10%
the 17th Earl certainly
fits into that category.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:10%
Crowns are symbols of monarchy
reserved for kings, queens,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:10%
and princes.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:06.170 align:middle line:10%
For example, the last Tudor
king, young Edward VI,

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.840 align:middle line:10%
but there's an
important distinction.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:10%
Coronets have points
or many ornaments

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.990 align:middle line:10%
attached to the gold headpiece.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:10%
Crowns have arches connecting
the ornaments which

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:10%
coronets specifically do not.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.310 align:middle line:10%
But there's one
exception to this rule.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:84%
The heir apparent can wear or
display a coronet with one arch

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.650 align:middle line:90%
only across the middle.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:90%
But there's more.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:10%
How many slashes are there
across this joining line?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.408 align:middle line:10%
Edward VI?

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:49.520 align:middle line:10%
Uh oh.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.540 align:middle line:10%
Edward VII.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.110 align:middle line:10%
It's hard to argue that he's
saying anything other than he's

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:10%
King Edward VII.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.890 align:middle line:84%
But, again, it's this
redundancy, the same message

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
over and over, that makes
the odds of probability

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:12.010 align:middle line:84%
of these clues being random
coincidences essentially zero.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:10%
For example, secret
letters passed

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.800 align:middle line:10%
between King James of Scotland
and Elizabeth's secretary

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.160 align:middle line:10%
of state Robert Cecil
reveal the code numbers

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:10%
of several high-ranking
members of Elizabeth's court.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:10%
Robert Cecil's was 10.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:10%
King James' was 30.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.130 align:middle line:10%
Oxford's number was 40.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.180 align:middle line:10%
At the very top of page
40 of the "First Folio,"

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:10%
there's a scene where
King Richard II is being

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:10%
forced to surrender his crown.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:10%
When asked if he's ready
to do so, Richard says I--

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:10%
no, no.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:52.900 align:middle line:10%
I-- for I must nothing be.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.910 align:middle line:10%
It sounds like he's undecided.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:10%
Yes, no, no, yes, but seen
as numbers this is 1-0-0-1,

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:07.990 align:middle line:10%
Cecil's code number 10
reversed against itself.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:10%
He continues therefore, no,
no, for I resigned to thee,

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:10%
but that's 4-0-0-4, Oxford's
code number reversed against

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.650 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:84%
Robert Cecil, the true
power in real life plotting

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to put King James of Scotland on
the English throne thus denying

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Oxford, who is clearly
saying he's the true heir.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Once, again, the real
play within the play.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
By reversing these code
numbers, Shakespeare

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:84%
is saying if you're
going to negate me,

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Cecil, force me to give up my
crown, I'm going to negate you.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:51.290 align:middle line:90%
1-0 becomes 0-1.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
History is going to know the
truth through the hidden codes

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm placing in these works.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
Carrying on, he says mark
me how I will undo myself,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
and for the next 17 lines,
he lists all the ritual

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.720 align:middle line:84%
acts of a monarch's coronation
ceremony but in reverse.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the speech
at the very bottom of page 40,

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:23.180 align:middle line:84%
he says command the
mirror here straight.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Just in case we didn't get
the clue, mirror imagery.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So now we're ready
to fully understand

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:37.040 align:middle line:84%
Polonius' big clue where he says
I will find where truth is hid

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:41.690 align:middle line:84%
though it were hid
indeed within the center.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
Look at all the
capitalized letters--

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
P-T, the Tau Rho, the
iconic Cristogram symbol

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:90%
that hides Horatio's name.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.970 align:middle line:90%
C, the Roman numeral for 100.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:05.560 align:middle line:90%
CI, Roman numeral for 101.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.490 align:middle line:84%
These are the absolute center
pages of the "First Folio"

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.180 align:middle line:84%
and here's what's
called the catchword.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a printing device used to
aid the compositors in putting

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:90%
the pages together correctly.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.650 align:middle line:10%
The word at the top
of the next page

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:10%
is also the printed word at the
bottom of the preceding page.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.590 align:middle line:84%
If they don't
match, the printers

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:29.230 align:middle line:90%
know the pages are out of order.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So the catchwords are
at the very center--

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:90%
Ore and then Ore.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:44.620 align:middle line:84%
This is the Latin word for
mouth but, again, revolve them,

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and we get ero, ero, Latin
for I will be what I will be,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:90%
the future tense name of God.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.600 align:middle line:84%
But, of course, it's
also saying very

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.290 align:middle line:84%
subtly I will be
the mouth of God,

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.750 align:middle line:84%
exactly what his pen
name anagram is saying,

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.685 align:middle line:90%
I am Asher Will Speake.

00:16:03.685 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.660 align:middle line:10%
Since the speech itself
is about the center,

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.840 align:middle line:10%
we can be sure Dee has left
something significant there as

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:10%
usual, and indeed there
are two center sections,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.130 align:middle line:10%
each containing
their own solution

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:10%
but each dependent on
recognizing the other.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.195 align:middle line:10%
It's diffused colored
paints mixed together again.

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:30.790 align:middle line:10%


00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.700 align:middle line:10%
Named T is the first one.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:10%
It's something whose name
is holy, the T, cross,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:10%
or maybe the altar.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:10%
But like his master code
in the Enochian tables,

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:10%
there's an embedded
trapdoor in it

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:10%
that will only make
sense when connected

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.900 align:middle line:10%
to the second solution
here, and that's

00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:01.390 align:middle line:10%
trifle, which can't really be
solved until we dig deeper.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:10%
So let's look at the grid.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.900 align:middle line:10%
First, we see the de Vere cross.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:12.420 align:middle line:10%
Then this starts as a
perfect South-West isle

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:10%
cross, which we saw previously.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:24.970 align:middle line:10%
But it goes further, the
West-South-West aisle, hill.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:10%
How perfect.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:10%
Richard Hill's tomb is there.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:37.726 align:middle line:10%
But if we close this box
shape up properly, what's U-M?

00:17:37.726 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:10%
It makes the word
hilum, which is

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:10%
Latin for trifle, the word
hidden in the second center.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.240 align:middle line:10%
So you ask.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:56.580 align:middle line:10%
Well, if "Hamlet" is the
play nearest to Oxford's

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.260 align:middle line:10%
autobiography, "The Tempest,"
is nearest to that of John Dee,

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:10%
and it's the one
time Shakespeare

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:10%
uses trifle Latin, hilum,
in its archaic sense meaning

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:10%
a fiction, an illusion, a trick.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:84%
It says, or some enchanted
trifle to abuse me.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:19.750 align:middle line:90%
How brilliant.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:84%
It contains the name
Hill but is telling us

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:29.590 align:middle line:84%
that Hill's tomb is
an illusion, a trick.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:90%
Set, right?

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:84%
It's even shaped like a
double box with the letters

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
H&E a Hebrew word
for God within.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.320 align:middle line:10%
There's more.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:10%
The He and the T-H combine
to give the Hebrew letter

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:10%
Heth, which means enclosure.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:10%
And as we all know,
the Hebrew alphabet

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.860 align:middle line:10%
was originally developed
from the Phoenicians.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:10%
Take a deep breath because
here's the original Phoenician

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.635 align:middle line:10%
version of the letter Heth.

00:19:06.635 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:10%
Precisely the same shape--

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:19.560 align:middle line:10%
Hilum, trifle, named, T,
gives us the physical location

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:10%
under Richard Hill's tomb where
we will find the altar stone

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:10%
or reversed find Will.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, as usual
it's signed by Dee.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.800 align:middle line:10%
Don't forget this was coded
400 years ago as a pointer

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:10%
to let initiates know where they
could find the missing altar

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.000 align:middle line:10%
stone at a later time when it
would be safe for the truth

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.470 align:middle line:10%
to come out, but nobody looked.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.670 align:middle line:10%
And now the stone has
been found and returned

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:56.820 align:middle line:10%
to its Holy of Holies
location, and we

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:10%
have the scientific
proof in the scan.

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:10%
An extension of the math
that he's determined

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:08.170 align:middle line:10%
will prove the
codes to be genuine.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But still it didn't
stop him trying his best

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:90%
to leave poetic proofs as well.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:10%
For instance, in the very last
sonnet, he writes this by that,

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:10%
I prove.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.740 align:middle line:10%
And in the poem that ends
the overall sequence,

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.680 align:middle line:10%
"A Lover's Complaint,"
there's an acrostic

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.720 align:middle line:10%
of o, o, o, o, mimicking
Edward de Vere's code number

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.600 align:middle line:10%
four O's, 40.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:38.685 align:middle line:10%
So how is he going to
prove this by that?

00:20:38.685 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:10%
By making the very last
line of the Sonnets

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:10%
plus the Latin finis, which
means the end, by turning that

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:56.670 align:middle line:10%
into an anagram, he
reveals this truth.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.500 align:middle line:10%
Love's fire heats water.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:10%
Water cools, not love.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:11.130 align:middle line:10%
Finis becomes altar stone solves
the final secret of WW 10,01

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.880 align:middle line:10%
signed E Vere.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:22.210 align:middle line:84%
In "A Lover's Complaint,"
he writes the fore-betrayed.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.290 align:middle line:84%
To betray means to
reveal but treacherously

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:31.330 align:middle line:84%
what was previously revealed in
the former sonnet code, which

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.300 align:middle line:84%
he's saying would have been
called treachery at the time.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.990 align:middle line:10%
So, again, the very
last line of the poem

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:10%
plus the Latin finis for
the end gives an anagram

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:10%
that reveals from these
words and new pervert

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:52.900 align:middle line:10%
a reconciled Maide finis,
it becomes in fine-- that's

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.140 align:middle line:10%
another way of saying
finis-- in the end,

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.500 align:middle line:10%
print conceals I
am Edward de Vere.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.224 align:middle line:90%
Could it be any clearer?

00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:07.192 align:middle line:90%

>> As Dee and de Vere compound
proofs on top of proofs,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
the scope of their
system broadens,

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:84%
revealing more and more
precise interconnections that

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:84%
ultimately confirm a
30-year master plan,

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
but their magnum opus connects
more than just the known works

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:90%
of Shakespeare.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.070 align:middle line:84%
In the next episode,
you're about to see proof

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that these Rosicrucian
masters played

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
a huge role in translating
the King James Bible.
