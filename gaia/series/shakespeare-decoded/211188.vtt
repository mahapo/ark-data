>>ALAN GREEN: In this episode,
we're going to be looking

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:10%
at a very specific
wrong page number--

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.310 align:middle line:10%
the last one in the folio.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.200 align:middle line:84%
We've barely been
able to scratch

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.420 align:middle line:84%
the surface of those
so-called wrong numbers in it,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:90%
but there are 67 such instances.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And every single one
of them tells a story

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.360 align:middle line:84%
or connects a certain
part of one play

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.490 align:middle line:84%
to another play
seemingly unrelated.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.180 align:middle line:10%
As we're about to see, the
codes at the end of "Cymbeline"

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:10%
connect to a specific
line in "Hamlet" that

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.020 align:middle line:10%
has baffled scholars for as long
as they've been studying him.

"Cymbeline" tells the story
of uniting Rome and England

at the end of a fictional war.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.400 align:middle line:84%
There's so much going on in the
play it's impossible and not

relevant here to cover it all.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.680 align:middle line:10%
Scholars far more knowledgeable
about the intricacies

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.080 align:middle line:10%
of the plot than
myself have noted there

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:10%
are 24 denouements in
the last scene alone.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.860 align:middle line:10%
So it can appear a
bit of a pat ending.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:10%
Amazingly, though,
he's pulling on threads

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.050 align:middle line:10%
from several different plays
and weaving them together

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:10%
into a magnificent tapestry
that needs to be viewed

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:10%
through a different lens.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.490 align:middle line:84%
It's an art form
we've never suspected

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and the world has
never seen before.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that,
he's using these

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
until now unrecognized
interconnections

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.949 align:middle line:84%
to tell a much broader
story outside of the context

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.960 align:middle line:84%
of the various plays
he's drawing from.

The bigger mystery
of who's actually

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:90%
behind these masterworks.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.280 align:middle line:10%
And as usual, the
most significant clues

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:10%
to the greater puzzle are given
to a seemingly insignificant

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:10%
character known only
as the Soothsayer.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, he or
she has had two visions,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.810 align:middle line:84%
each delivering essentially
the same information.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Yet she interprets them in
completely opposite ways

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.750 align:middle line:84%
at two different
stages in the plot.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.080 align:middle line:84%
It's really emblematic of the
Shakespeare mystery, isn't it?

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So the author gives
her only a couple

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:90%
of speeches in the whole drama.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But he really makes them pay off
by highlighting certain words

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:90%
with key capital letters.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the
altar, take a look.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.090 align:middle line:84%
In the first of these
visions, the Soothsayer

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
says, "Jove's bird,
the Roman eagle.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.490 align:middle line:90%
From South to the West."

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
But then in the second vision,
she says battle at this instant

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.350 align:middle line:84%
is full accomplished
for the Roman Eagle

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.510 align:middle line:90%
from South to West in the West.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:10%
Now in King Cymbeline's
final speech,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:10%
the very last paragraph
of the play is he says,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:10%
"From our blest altars, publish
we this," and his last sentence

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.680 align:middle line:10%
is exactly 100 characters, which
produces a perfect grid of 10

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:10%
by 10, the divine
number squared.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.260 align:middle line:10%
We're being reminded
to recognize

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:10%
the importance of
Dee's mathoetic system,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:10%
in which the center
letters are i, d, b, e.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Simple and straightforward.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:84%
According to Freud, the id
is the primary component

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
of personality.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:90%
The essential self.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
It comes from its
original Latin,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.260 align:middle line:90%
meaning "id" equals "this."

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.580 align:middle line:10%
"Be" is self-explanatory.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:10%
It means, "is."

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:10%
So it's the same as
saying "this is."

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.530 align:middle line:10%
Or an impersonal
version of "I am."

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.090 align:middle line:84%
Expanding by only one
letter away from the center,

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
we find the very
same capital letters

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that were highlighted
in both the Soothsayer's

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:90%
final speeches--

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.490 align:middle line:90%
i, b, r, e.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
Jove's bird and Roman eagle.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
letters i and j are

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
interchangeable in the
Renaissance alphabet.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But the line starts with
the seemingly innocuous

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.680 align:middle line:90%
observation, "I saw."

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:10%
And that's significant because
a saw in Shakespeare's usage

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:10%
is a wise saying,
a sacred truth.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.770 align:middle line:10%
As he says in Henry VI,
"holy saws of sacred writ."

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the job description
of a soothsayer, a truthteller,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.730 align:middle line:90%
to foresee a sacred truth.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:10%
In other words, a
holy prediction.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.700 align:middle line:84%
It's all encapsulated in the
powerful vision she had twice

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.700 align:middle line:84%
of this symbolic
bird, the eagle,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
to which she assigned two
contrasting interpretations.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.970 align:middle line:10%
But of course, we're now well
aware, this is not a mistake.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:10%
In the context of the play,
the eagle represents the mighty

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.040 align:middle line:10%
army of Caesar's.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.950 align:middle line:10%
But as a visionary
symbol, it has far deeper

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:10%
meaning, having been
almost universally adopted

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:10%
to represent not only military
power, but the discernment

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.470 align:middle line:10%
to use it, tempered with wisdom.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:84%
As such, it has been the
symbol of the Knights Templar,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.560 align:middle line:84%
the Freemasons,
the Rosicrucians,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptian mystery schools,
and of course, America, which

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.760 align:middle line:84%
was just beginning to be
founded by the same groups

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
at the center of this
Shakespeare movement.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.130 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
eagle symbol has

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:84%
been ubiquitous in all
the major secret societies

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.300 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:10%
But amongst these secret
initiatory groups,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:10%
there's a double meaning hinted
at by these four letters-- i,

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:10%
r, e, b.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.040 align:middle line:10%
First, the spiritual aspect
we've already touched on

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:10%
rooted in why Oxford
is linking his identity

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:10%
to the Egyptian myth of Horus.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.860 align:middle line:10%
You see, the moment Set looks
out Horus' left eye, the moon,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.430 align:middle line:10%
Horus assumes his aspect
as Ra or Re-Horakhty.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:10%
The right eye of the sun.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:10%
And the two remaining letters
form the companion word to Re,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:10%
"ib."

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.560 align:middle line:10%
The heart, represented
by the scarab beetle that

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.370 align:middle line:10%
pushes the ball of the
sun to rise every morning,

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:10%
forming the crown of Re.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.420 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that a wonderful analogy?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:10%
It takes heart in
the morning to drive

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:10%
us to be productive
through the heat of the day

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.780 align:middle line:10%
through our action.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.520 align:middle line:10%
But if we revolve those
letters, the spiritual message

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.110 align:middle line:10%
rises to a whole other level.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.820 align:middle line:10%
This is typical John
Dee and extremely deep.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.650 align:middle line:10%
E, R, and B, I.
Elizabeth Regina,

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:10%
and the cunningly
deceptive initials

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.470 align:middle line:10%
of Ben Jonson that really
stand for the twin pillars

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:57.210 align:middle line:10%
of Solomon's Temple,
Boaz and Jachin.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.050 align:middle line:10%
We're going to have to look at
Dee's brilliantly coded grid

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.110 align:middle line:10%
construction of Shakespeare's
gravestone again,

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:10%
where we see ST, ST, ST,
standing for Solomon's Temple

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:10%
three times.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.340 align:middle line:10%
But they also contain
their own hidden meanings.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.720 align:middle line:84%
TTT is the Freemasons'
acronym for the Triple Tau,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:90%
the Holy of Holies, the D'Vir.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:10%
SSS is their acronym
for Stiletto Siddesh

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.360 align:middle line:10%
Solo, the residence of
the Lord in creation.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:10%
The Ark of the Covenant.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.830 align:middle line:10%
The pillars, too, have sun
and moon characteristics.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:10%
RE, the sun pillar, is
connected through the middle

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:10%
to the central ST. Its
opposite, ER, the moon pillar,

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.190 align:middle line:10%
that's the goddess Diana,
Queen Elizabeth again.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Thus we see the TH
connected to it,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
the divine right of kings
aspect of the I am that I am.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:90%
It's all there.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:05.220 align:middle line:90%
The most perfect visual code.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:84%
All of which is leading us
to examine the very first

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:90%
statement in the First Folio.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Because once again, he's guiding
us towards this connection.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
The first connects to the last.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Just like Oxford's
crown signature,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
just like the entire 30
years plan of all his works,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.370 align:middle line:90%
the Alpha Omega System.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Just like the very first
code we ever encountered,

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:84%
aleph becomes tav,
is everywhere.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Again, it's very repetitive.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's only this kind of
redundant attention to detail

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
that can prove mathematically
what Shakespeare knew he cannot

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.170 align:middle line:90%
prove poetically.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.780 align:middle line:10%
Here's the very first
statement to the reader.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:10%
Look at the tilted
small case letter e.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.860 align:middle line:10%
It just looks like
a mistake, right?

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.940 align:middle line:10%
The letter was sloppily
placed on the press, maybe.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, you only have to look
at the block-ish design

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.180 align:middle line:10%
and depth of the
Gutenberg type pieces

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.240 align:middle line:10%
and how they were busted
up against each other

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:10%
in rigid formation to
realize a letter tilted

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.840 align:middle line:10%
at an angle of 10 degrees
like that was impossible.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.110 align:middle line:10%
It just could not be a mistake.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:10%
It would require the making
of a special type piece.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Just as we saw with the
reversed R in the last episode.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And they were made from an alloy
of lead, tin, and antimony.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
So strong and durable,
they remained the standard

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.170 align:middle line:90%
for 550 years.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.020 align:middle line:90%
So they didn't wear out.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.240 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't be
slanting like that.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.470 align:middle line:90%
This is intentional.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And they would have had to have
made another special character.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:90%
A lot of work.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So what is it saying?

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:10%
Watch carefully.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:06.700 align:middle line:10%
"I will find where truth is hid.

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:11.010 align:middle line:10%
Though it were hidden
deep within the center."

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:10%


00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:21.360 align:middle line:10%
Perfect, pure mirror
image of eRe or decoded,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:10%
ER and RE, right
in the very center.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.380 align:middle line:10%
Is Regina, ER, or Rex, RE.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.970 align:middle line:10%
So he is reversed, Rex Edward.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:40.380 align:middle line:10%
Visually, he's being pushed out
of the way with that slanted e.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:10%
The message is clear.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.280 align:middle line:10%
There's not room enough
for both of them.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:10%
And it was famously uttered
by the Queen herself.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.160 align:middle line:84%
"I will have one mistress
here and no master.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:90%
No man shall rule over me."

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:10%
So we have the
exact same message

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.950 align:middle line:10%
in the very first thing
we see in the folio

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:10%
as is in the very last 100
characters of "Cymbeline."

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.900 align:middle line:10%
ER, the queen, cannot
allow RE, the king.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.170 align:middle line:10%
And they're showing us
two portals to this truth.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:10%
The very pillars
one passes through

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:10%
to enter Solomon's Temple,
Boaz Jachin, to reach--

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:10%
where?

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.240 align:middle line:10%
The Holy of Holies.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.250 align:middle line:10%
The de Vere.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
very same portals

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:84%
one passes through to
enter into the truth

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.440 align:middle line:84%
of these sacred writings in
the First Folio, de Vere.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:40.020 align:middle line:84%
The portals are the
letters ER and BI.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:10%
And what word do
they themselves,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:47.850 align:middle line:10%
by revolving om, bier.

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.820 align:middle line:10%
An old middle English
word meaning "a framework

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:10%
for carrying a
corpse or coffin."

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:10%
The absolute clarity
of meaning is stunning.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.040 align:middle line:10%
It perfectly describes
the dilemma of Oxford

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:10%
and the Queen's doomed romance.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.480 align:middle line:10%
Love that cannot survive.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And these works through
which he's pouring out

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
every emotion humans are
privy to and prisoners of,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:90%
his entire--

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.310 align:middle line:84%
I have to say it,
his entire corpus.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
His body of work
are exactly that.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:84%
A framework for carrying
the corpse of their love.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It's the impossible
imbalance between Elizabeth's

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
personal life and her
political obligations.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.040 align:middle line:10%
She had to totally deny
any natural passions,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.450 align:middle line:10%
especially true love in
order to protect her country

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:10%
and her subjects from attack.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.415 align:middle line:84%
She was basically
trapped by her job.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth had to be publicly
the Virgin Queen and seemingly

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
available to give her would-be
European royal suitors

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
hope of religious
reconciliation without having

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.530 align:middle line:90%
to resort to military conflict.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
Which, of course, the
Spanish ultimately

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:90%
did anyway, unsuccessfully.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.150 align:middle line:84%
The war Elizabeth was
constantly having to manage

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.630 align:middle line:84%
was the religious one between
the Catholics, Rome, Italy,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and the Protestants,
London, England.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.480 align:middle line:10%
But that's just the
outer metaphorical code

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.230 align:middle line:10%
that Shakespeare has set
up as the curtain raiser.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Now Dee gets to weigh in.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And between them, they turn
those last 100 characters

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:90%
into--

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what to
call it sometimes.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.090 align:middle line:84%
A symphony of letters
mathematically

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.810 align:middle line:84%
placed to reveal
even deeper meanings.

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And as you watch
the magic unfold,

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
try to imagine the inconceivable
task of constructing this

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.680 align:middle line:84%
from scratch with
nothing but an empty 10

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.830 align:middle line:90%
by 10 grid in front of you.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.620 align:middle line:10%
We've already seen what
the very center has to be--

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.970 align:middle line:10%
I, D, B, E. And as near
to the center as possible,

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.470 align:middle line:10%
he's placed this platform
shape of three supporting one,

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.900 align:middle line:10%
like the initiatory
steps of Freemasonry.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.580 align:middle line:10%
Now just watch.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:10%
As Dee secures the center of his
construction with two perfectly

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.040 align:middle line:10%
balanced tau crosses facing
each other horizontally.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.240 align:middle line:10%
What do they say?

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:90%


00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.700 align:middle line:10%
JD.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:10%
In his favorite number
seven formation,

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:10%
balanced upper and lower.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:10%
And a code.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.480 align:middle line:10%
Of course.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:10%
He's literally signing
this in the center.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:10%
A John Dee code.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:10%
Two more balanced oppositional
crosses appear on the right.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:10%
The top portion is a
perfectly constructed trinity

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:04.600 align:middle line:10%
of the Soothsayer's message,
"I saw," "I saw," "I saw."

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.660 align:middle line:10%
Beneath it, another
OOD signature, again,

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:10%
perfectly balanced.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.760 align:middle line:10%
And now the connection to
the Soothsayer's vision

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:10%
begins to materialize.

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:10%
South-west-west.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.480 align:middle line:10%
Recall that she said she
saw Imperial Caesar's Roman

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:27.730 align:middle line:10%
eagle fly from the south in
Rome to radiant "Cymbeline,"

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:10%
England's king, in the West.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
They had to have
worked really hard

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
to make every detail
of this perfect.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:10%
Especially the part where the
geography is entirely wrong.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:46.300 align:middle line:10%
From Italy, Rome, in the South.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:10%
Well maybe, if you're
heading to Sweden.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.780 align:middle line:10%
But to England?

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.690 align:middle line:10%
London in the West?

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:10%
It's more Northwest, isn't it?

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:10%
In fact, let's be as
accurate as we know Dee is.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:10%
Technically it's
North-North-West.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.569 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's that crazy
line uttered by Hamlet

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:90%
feigning madness.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.560 align:middle line:90%
"I am but mad.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.000 align:middle line:10%
North-North-West."

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.030 align:middle line:10%
And remember that clue from
"Cymbeline's" last paragraph,

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.869 align:middle line:10%
"from our blest altars
publish we this."

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't explain why
my intuition can

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.420 align:middle line:84%
penetrate to the heart of
these Shakespeare codes.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:10%
But I do know when I look
at 17 characters in a row

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:10%
and they jump out at me in this
very awkwardly worded phrase

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:10%
where the King is
saying, hey, let's

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:10%
publish the news of this piece
from our blest altars, plural--

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.350 align:middle line:10%
notice.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:49.100 align:middle line:84%
"To all our subjects
set we forward."

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
I think if you
weren't constrained

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.090 align:middle line:84%
by having to write a code,
you could do better than that,

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.490 align:middle line:90%
couldn't you, Ed?

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:90%
But of course, it's an anagram.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.360 align:middle line:90%
West-South-West Stratford.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:08.290 align:middle line:84%
Or better yet, Oxford's
crown code hidden

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:10.060 align:middle line:90%
within his own signature.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It says See W.W,
colon, Stratford.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Even the punctuation is perfect.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.050 align:middle line:10%
In which case, the awful
North-North-West geographical

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:29.160 align:middle line:10%
mistake is, in fact, a perfect
set of directions to where we

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:10%
actually have to go--

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:10%
to Stratford, to find
out the truth about WW

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:41.190 align:middle line:10%
and the de Vere altar buried
beneath the Richard Hill altar.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Plural, right.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:90%
Blessed altars.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Note the two
different spellings.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:90%
One L and then two L's.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.630 align:middle line:10%
LLL is another enormous
clue from another play,

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:10%
"Love's Labor's Lost,"
that we don't have time

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.250 align:middle line:10%
to get into here,
which is showing you

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:10%
how they're all connected.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.220 align:middle line:84%
His tomb was erected in
1593, the very year William

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare's name burst onto
the scene for the first time

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:90%
in "Venus and Adonis."

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:10%
Yet the hidden de Vere altar
under Richard Hill's altar

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.530 align:middle line:10%
wasn't rediscovered until almost
three centuries later, 1889.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.090 align:middle line:10%
They hid it well.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:10%
But also somewhere
where they knew

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:10%
it would inevitably be
found, because, hey,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.160 align:middle line:10%
flagstones eventually wear out.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.630 align:middle line:10%
Very slowly.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:10%
Placed in the exact
location we see it in today

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:10%
by Freemasons who
obviously knew some very

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:10%
esoteric circumference-based
geometry that ends up

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.410 align:middle line:10%
pointing back to itself.

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.500 align:middle line:10%
Or to where it had been
hiding all that time.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.710 align:middle line:10%
The only possible reason for
such mathematical gymnastics

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.950 align:middle line:10%
must have been to show
other initiates the mirror

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:10%
imagery of
mathematics and poetry

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.900 align:middle line:10%
underpinning this entire
alchemical structure.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.160 align:middle line:10%
The only possible reason.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:09.710 align:middle line:10%
That is unless it's actually
a portal of some kind.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And at this stage, honestly,
I wouldn't rule anything out.

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
But let's move
on, because once I

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.810 align:middle line:84%
saw that its location is
precisely West-South-West

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.420 align:middle line:84%
of where the altar
is today, I realized

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:29.390 align:middle line:84%
this can only be the work
of self-realized beings.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:35.210 align:middle line:10%
If this is all so that we, you
and me, we little humanoids,

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:38.750 align:middle line:10%
this whole magnum opus
has been created for,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:44.840 align:middle line:10%
if we get to see who
WW is in Stratford,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.880 align:middle line:10%
then the Soothsayer
is clearly saying

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.340 align:middle line:10%
she saw three sacred
predictions in her vision.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.480 align:middle line:10%
Not in the play "Cymbeline,"
but in the play within the play.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.940 align:middle line:10%
That's what she's
pointing us to.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:10%
And they're obviously connected
to the most famous play

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:10%
within the play, "Hamlet."

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.020 align:middle line:10%
Because, well, let's look
at the rest of what Hamlet

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:10%
says in his truly crazy line.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.010 align:middle line:10%
He actually says, "I am but mad.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:14.360 align:middle line:10%
North-North-West.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:10%
When the Wind is Southerly, I
know a hawk from a handsaw."

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:10%
Any questions?

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:10%
What a great theatrical
device madness is.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:10%
You can have your hero say
anything that's really a code,

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.430 align:middle line:10%
and the audience
ignores how crazy

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:10%
it is because, hey, he's crazy.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:10%
So look at the capital
letters in that--

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:41.500 align:middle line:10%
N, N, W, W, S. But it's a code.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:10%
So we revolve it from SW.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.850 align:middle line:10%
Then he adds another W,
and we get West-South-West.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.480 align:middle line:10%
So what's handsaw about?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:10%
Anyone got a handsaw?

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.990 align:middle line:10%
Here's a handsaw.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:59.360 align:middle line:10%
Perfectly embedded in
another horizontal cross

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.640 align:middle line:10%
that slips into
the other crosses

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.590 align:middle line:10%
without disturbing
a single letter.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.005 align:middle line:10%
What's left?

00:22:06.005 --> 00:22:06.805 align:middle line:10%
ER.

00:22:06.805 --> 00:22:09.380 align:middle line:10%


00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.475 align:middle line:10%
Or is it RE?

00:22:10.475 --> 00:22:13.010 align:middle line:10%


00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Or is it all another brilliant
combination, handsaw, as in

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:10%
hand, sacred truth, which
was a real thing back

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.500 align:middle line:10%
then called handfasting.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.250 align:middle line:10%
There's a theory that
the Queen and Oxford

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:10%
had an affair from 1572 to '74.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:32.330 align:middle line:10%
During that time, we know that
they had three private visits

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.590 align:middle line:10%
with the Archbishop
of Canterbury,

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:10%
the only person in
the church permitted

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.880 align:middle line:10%
to marry the sovereign.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.400 align:middle line:84%
In those days, a private
betrothal ceremony

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.520 align:middle line:84%
with an exchange of
rings, called handfasting,

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.400 align:middle line:84%
was as legally binding as
a public church wedding.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And if a child was
on the way, it's

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:84%
almost inevitable
they would have

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:84%
had to pledge
their love this way

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.218 align:middle line:84%
in order to legalize their
offspring in preparation

00:22:58.218 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:84%
for the day when
Elizabeth would eventually

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.730 align:middle line:90%
need to name a successor.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
If that's the case,
handsaw would indeed

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
be a way of indicating
such a secret marriage.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:10%
But it's not conclusive
unless there's a covert reason

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:10%
for comparing it to a hawke.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:10%
Which seems on the surface
utterly nonsensical.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:27.970 align:middle line:10%
Until we realize it's
an anagram of Hew Ka.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.820 align:middle line:10%
See, there's a prominent clue
at the very end of the Sonnets

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.460 align:middle line:10%
that's never been understood
by mainstream scholars.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:10%
What are these large
letters, KA, doing here?

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:10%
Well the A is the catchword,
because the first word

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:10%
on the next page is the A
of "A Lover's Complaint."

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:10%
But it's been printed
far larger and raised

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:10%
far higher than it
should be in order

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.560 align:middle line:10%
to be unnecessarily prominent.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.820 align:middle line:10%
What's the K?

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.180 align:middle line:10%
This is another device
used by the printers

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:10%
for the same purpose of helping
collate the pages correctly.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.320 align:middle line:84%
They're grouped into batches,
each marked by a letter.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.760 align:middle line:84%
There's only one
problem, though.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.690 align:middle line:84%
The letter for this
batch should be I.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's been deliberately
printed incorrectly as K

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and made far larger and higher
than it should be in order

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to make the Egyptian
word, Ka, used

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.990 align:middle line:84%
to denote one of
the five attributes

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.900 align:middle line:90%
of the deceased Pharaoh King--

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:90%
Ba, Ib, Ka, Ren, Shute.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Ka means-- drumroll, please--

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.800 align:middle line:90%
the spirit double of the King.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.310 align:middle line:84%
So Hew Ka is the
very last message

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
of the end of the Sonnets,
the King's double.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.420 align:middle line:90%
And Hew, cut into stone.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.840 align:middle line:84%
The answer to the King's double
is inside the altar stone,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.235 align:middle line:90%
which I have hewn.

00:24:57.235 --> 00:24:59.990 align:middle line:90%


00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find it in the
West-South-West cross aisle,

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.870 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.295 align:middle line:90%
So that's prediction number one.

00:25:07.295 --> 00:25:09.810 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:15.090 align:middle line:10%
Another two perfectly balanced
crosses intersect here.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:10%
Vere.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.440 align:middle line:10%
E of O is playing two roles.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.640 align:middle line:10%
It's cross revolved.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.460 align:middle line:10%
And just in case we're not
totally convinced yet--

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:10%
I, Edward.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:10%
That's prediction number two.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.510 align:middle line:10%
Now another two perfect
crosses intersect.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:37.030 align:middle line:10%
De Vere's altar.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:10%
Or de Vere altars, plural.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:10%
Remember "Cymbeline's"
curious announcement?

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.190 align:middle line:10%
Plural altars.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.920 align:middle line:10%
And finally at the
top, Veres sealed it.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, yes, of course they did.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.680 align:middle line:10%
When we turn over the
engraving page of the folio,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:10%
the first thing we see is
a dedication to the two

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.760 align:middle line:10%
most noble and incomparable
pair of brethren-- brethren

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.980 align:middle line:10%
is the term for initiated
members of Freemasonic temples.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.290 align:middle line:84%
The first is William,
3rd Earl of Pembroke.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.020 align:middle line:84%
The second is Philip,
fourth Earl of Pembroke.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
William was engaged
to Bridget de Vere,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:90%
Oxford's second daughter.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.620 align:middle line:84%
Philip was married to Susan de
Vere, Oxford's third daughter.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:90%
So look at that.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.800 align:middle line:84%
The First Folio is dedicated
to the whole de Vere family.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, no doubt de Veres
did seal the de Vere altar

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:10%
stone when it finally
was ready to be buried

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:10%
under Richard Hill's altar.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.300 align:middle line:10%
Prediction number three.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.370 align:middle line:10%
And they probably
used a handsaw.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:90%
It's almost too much.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But remember, it's
the redundancy.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.510 align:middle line:90%
It's intentional.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:54.920 align:middle line:84%
Because the proof is in
the magic of the math.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So to balance the very
last words in the folio,

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Dee makes the very first words
be a perfect 17 by 17 grid.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm just saying.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And when we see it lined up,
EO Vere, TH, TH, altars--

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.505 align:middle line:90%
Triple Tau altars.

00:27:22.505 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the vertical
line and then

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
horizontally,
West-South-West cross aisle.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And then you add In Hills,
West-South-West cross aisle.

00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:37.840 align:middle line:90%


00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.268 align:middle line:84%
Signed, of course,
by our guy, OOD.

00:27:42.268 --> 00:27:43.765 align:middle line:90%
I rest my case.

00:27:43.765 --> 00:27:48.210 align:middle line:90%


00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The next episode, 007, will
be a class in how to decrypt

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.900 align:middle line:84%
a suspected code using
everything we've learned so far

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and tying together as many
of these strands as possible

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.950 align:middle line:84%
so as to get a clear picture of
why Shakespeare is relentlessly

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:09.490 align:middle line:84%
leading us to perhaps the
biggest question of all,

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:14.130 align:middle line:90%
to be or not to be king?

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, history
records that Elizabeth

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.110 align:middle line:90%
died without naming an heir.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.430 align:middle line:84%
But history, as we know,
is written by the winners.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Or in this case, those who
retain power during a monarch's

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.970 align:middle line:90%
transition of succession.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:37.620 align:middle line:10%
And that was Robert Cecil, de
Vere's almost lifelong nemesis.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.930 align:middle line:84%
How will their final
crossing of swords work out?

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:48.000 align:middle line:90%
