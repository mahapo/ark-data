we've learned so far and tying
together all the hints we've

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
explored that have led us
inevitably to the big question,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.070 align:middle line:90%
to be or not to be the king?

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I just can't wait to show you
because if Shakespeare is going

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:84%
to leave one final coup de grace
hidden for us, proving what he

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.680 align:middle line:84%
wants us to know, it's got
to be in "Hamlet," most

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:90%
autobiographical play of all.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And what more significant
place than in his dying words?

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's go to the Holy of Holies
and reveal Shakespeare's

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.650 align:middle line:90%
biggest secret of all.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.280 align:middle line:90%


00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.630 align:middle line:84%
The first clue we have
that there's even a code

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.490 align:middle line:84%
involved here is that
there are three wrong page

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.220 align:middle line:90%
numbers surrounding the play.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:84%
Starting at page 98, the
end of "Timon of Athens,"

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.800 align:middle line:84%
the next two are unnumbered
but should be 99 and 100,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.690 align:middle line:90%
but 101 suddenly jumps to 109.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.460 align:middle line:84%
It carries on from there
until the end of "Macbeth"

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.990 align:middle line:84%
so that "Hamlet"
starts at page 152.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.990 align:middle line:90%
As we'll see, that's important.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
The numbering continues fine
but suddenly jumps by a hundred.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And then it carries
on again until we

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.150 align:middle line:84%
reach the end of
"Hamlet," where it goes

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.580 align:middle line:90%
backwards to another page 280.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
All that apparently so as to
surround Hamlet's dying speech

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.640 align:middle line:90%
with two page 280s.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Scratch those two zeros.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
They literally are nothings,
called nulls in cryptography,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
exactly half of
Oxford's 0000 cipher.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Look at the speech.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:90%
"O, I dye, Horatio."

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Zero, one.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.130 align:middle line:84%
An immediate clue, the
letters M, O, A, I--

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
the "Twelfth Night"
code that instructs

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
us to revolve into the
Freemasons' sacred IAOM

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.960 align:middle line:90%
password.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
He's telling us to look
for mirror imagery.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.990 align:middle line:10%
And there it is at the
end of the first line--

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:10%
I, O. That's the "I, no;
no, I," from "Richard II,"

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:10%
page 40, where he's being
forced to surrender his crown.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.530 align:middle line:10%
And number 10, remember, is
one-zero, Robert Cecil's code

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.330 align:middle line:10%
number.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.520 align:middle line:10%
By reversing it,
Shakespeare's saying,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:10%
if you're going to negate me,
force me to give up my crown,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.550 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to negate you.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.519 align:middle line:90%
One-zero becomes zero-one.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.190 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the
speech, the rest

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.975 align:middle line:84%
is silence followed by that
terrible line, "O, O, O, O."

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that's
Oxford's code number--

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:90%
40, four Os.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Again, page 40, second line,
"Therefore no 'no,' for I

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:90%
resign to thee."

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.780 align:middle line:10%
By inverting his own
four-zero to zero-four,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.520 align:middle line:10%
Oxford is saying King Richard's
story is his own story.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:84%
"Dyes" again, a sly
O-O-D clue, yes?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
"Dye," "dye"--
this is a standoff

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:90%
between Oxford and Cecil.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
History will know
the truth of what

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
happened because these codes
will last forever in my works,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%
he's saying.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.390 align:middle line:84%
Cecil is the real political
power behind King James.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And "Hamlet," Oxford
is setting the record

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
straight in the play and
the play within the play--

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.240 align:middle line:90%
the wrong man is on the throne.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
As always, we look at
the center for the truth.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.480 align:middle line:84%
"Lights" is the center
word of the speech.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.720 align:middle line:84%
There are 28 words
before it and 28 words

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
after it, the wrong page
numbers minus those nulls

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.750 align:middle line:90%
of Oxford's cipher.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.140 align:middle line:90%
But why 28?

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:10%
The 28th degree of
Scottish Rite Freemasonry

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:10%
is called the Knight
of the Sun and even

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:10%
embeds the Knight
of the Sun number

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.480 align:middle line:10%
into the Sonnet's Dedication--

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.710 align:middle line:10%
28 words followed by
28 dots and the T-T key

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:10%
that unlocks the Enochian
tables at the bottom.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, a center phrase, "The
election lights on Fortinbras."

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Almost all versions
of this four-hour play

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.300 align:middle line:84%
are drastically
cut, so most people

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.370 align:middle line:84%
are unfamiliar with
the character who

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.160 align:middle line:90%
has the final word, Fortinbras.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We hardly ever see him,
but both he and Hamlet

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
have father kings
of the same name.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:84%
Both are intent on revenging
the deaths of their fathers.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But Fortinbras wins his
kingdom as Hamlet loses his.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They are oppositional
mirrors of each other,

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.530 align:middle line:90%
and for good reason.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:84%
The name Fortinbras is
completely fictional.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It was created solely to
unlock the true Hamlet-Oxford

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.780 align:middle line:90%
identity, a firstborn.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:10%
Furthermore, "the election
lights on Fortinbras"

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:11.675 align:middle line:10%
reveals a firstborn
son of light.

00:07:11.675 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And then what's this?

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It's blurry, but
checking several folios

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.040 align:middle line:84%
at higher resolution
shows it's in all of them.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
It looks like a Hebrew
vav, but it's definitely

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.530 align:middle line:84%
another of those
specially-created characters.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Finally, Dee's favorite
device, the colon.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.470 align:middle line:10%
He can use it as just one
character or, if needed,

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:10%
as nulls--

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:10%
two dots to shift
letters in a grid.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:10%
First, we examine the
position of this character

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:10%
to see if it's significant
mathematically.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.030 align:middle line:84%
There are 94
characters before it,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:58.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's the 152nd character
from the end, 94 over 152

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:05.080 align:middle line:84%
gives us 0.618,
the golden ratio,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.200 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
important constants

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
that Dee uses in
countless codes.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:18.270 align:middle line:84%
There's no way this vav is
there by accident, so we dig.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:10%
And we realize,
oh, 152 is the page

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:10%
"Hamlet" starts at, but only
because of that wrong page

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:10%
number juggling at the start.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Plus, it's the cutoff point of
the Sonnet's pyramid structure

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.570 align:middle line:10%
marking the Great
Pyramid platform

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.030 align:middle line:10%
under the missing pyramidion.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle line:84%
It's time to put
this into a grid.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Counting the colon as
either one or two nulls,

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:84%
both totals produce
unusable grids.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But counting the colon
as two characters

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and counting this vav
gives us 247 characters,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.750 align:middle line:90%
and we're in business.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So the vav is definitely an
intentional part of the code.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And since all these codes must
be revolved, right, we flip it,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:90%
and it becomes a capital L.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
The center is as
perfect as could be--

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:24.100 align:middle line:84%
I, the self, unity
consciousness.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:84%
A line going straight up the
center reveals Vere, truth.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:84%
A line going down the
center reveals de Vere

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
and the signature
of the Rosie Cross

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
with the double-T going
through it, the key

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.730 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of the
Sonnet's Dedication.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Moving up, we find C, the
Roman numeral for 100,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.550 align:middle line:84%
coupled with the center square
gives us the Roman numeral

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
I, confirming the
very center pages

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of the folio, 100
and 101, where we

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:03.010 align:middle line:90%
will find truth is hid, Vere.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And "ore, ore,"
becomes O, E, O, R, E--

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.880 align:middle line:84%
again, to be or
not to be a king.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, the I in the center
is not part of a word.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:90%
It's sacred, the self.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It should remain untouched
by everything around it.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.710 align:middle line:90%
Here's Fortinbras, a firstborn.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the very center, that
phrase lights on Fortinbras.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Note that for the
phrase to be central,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:84%
we can't use the O-N at the end
of the line or the center I,

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.750 align:middle line:84%
but there's another I and
O-N preceding the phrase.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Attention to detail--
it's impeccable.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.760 align:middle line:90%
Light.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Sun.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:10%
Still centered, but higher up--

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:10%
of.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Members of these
secret societies

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.370 align:middle line:84%
ascend through successive
levels of initiations

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:90%
which they represent visually.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.400 align:middle line:84%
It looks like he's building
those ascending levels,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:90%
doesn't it?

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, you see it--

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:19.210 align:middle line:84%
a pyramidion highlight the
letters we haven't used yet.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And this punctuation helps the
solution make grammatical sense

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.590 align:middle line:84%
because here's an I we can
use, leaving the center one

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.490 align:middle line:90%
untouched.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
I, comma, de Vere, comma,
the T-H stands out.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I am, but I am.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, Elizabeth
makes her entrance,

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.180 align:middle line:84%
the T-H indicating the
divine right of kings.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
It's no longer
all about de Vere.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, we see he couldn't
have achieved this

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
without the use of
that inverted vav.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
It had to be a character that
wouldn't ruin the sentence

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.880 align:middle line:84%
but could be a
letter when needed.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Still, the name
is only Elizbeth.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.400 align:middle line:84%
We need an A. And here it
is, the a of "a firstborn."

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:10%
If we reassign it to
make Elizabeth perfect,

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:14.020 align:middle line:10%
it turns "a
firstborn," suggesting

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:10%
there are many,
into just firstborn,

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:10%
meaning there's only one.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.880 align:middle line:10%
We're left with two
statements, "I am Elizabeth"

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:10%
and "I de Vere."

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:10%
Both are Rosicrucians,
obviously, but who

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:10%
is this firstborn son of light?

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:10%
The answer must be in what
sits atop the 152nd level

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramid of sonnets,
the missing pyramidion

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:10%
with its all-seeing eye.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:10%
So what is it saying?

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:10%
We need to look at "The Knight
of the Tree of the Sunne."

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.150 align:middle line:90%
I want you to picture it.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.250 align:middle line:10%
The contestants
are all preparing

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:10%
before dawn, determined to
defeat Oxford, who is not

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.770 align:middle line:10%
popular at core because he's a
know-it-all who, unfortunately,

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:10%
does know it all.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.530 align:middle line:84%
As the sun rises,
they look eastward

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
along the 650-foot tiltyard
and see a huge bay tree

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:90%
shimmering pure gold.

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Oxford makes his entrance
clad in gold armor, seated

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
on a gold caparison horse
in front of a huge tree

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.820 align:middle line:84%
with every leaf, every branch,
the whole trunk covered

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%
in pure gold leaf.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
His servants had
decorated it overnight

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
so that Oxford could emerge
in the morning shining

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:90%
like the sun.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:84%
He then has his page
deliver an oration

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.820 align:middle line:84%
to Queen Elizabeth
called "The Knight

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.230 align:middle line:84%
of the Tree of the Sunne,"
expressing his undying devotion

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:90%
to her as her loyal knight.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.550 align:middle line:84%
He says he would
willingly die a thousand

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
deaths to defend her crown.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It's an unparalleled promise
of faithfulness delivered

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:84%
before the entire court
and about 12,000 spectators

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in the cheap seats all
along the tiltyard.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:84%
His words are so compelling,
the dramatic vision

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.520 align:middle line:84%
he's materialized
so powerful, it's

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Shakespeare in
the park centuries

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
before that was a thing, a
foretaste of what will soon

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
make Elizabeth's
court and the London

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:90%
playhouses the envy of Europe.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
His oratory starts by
saying, "The world has

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:90%
counteless varieties of trees.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
All have their particular uses
and their imperfections too,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:84%
but he, a wandering knight in
search of shade came across,"

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.480 align:middle line:84%
quote, "A tree so
beautiful, his eyes

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.960 align:middle line:84%
were dazzled with
the brightness,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:84%
For as the clear
beams of the Sun

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:84%
cause all the stars
to lose their light,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
so the brightness of this golden
Tree eclipseth all others.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
The leaves of pure
gold, the root so

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:21.750 align:middle line:84%
noble as it springeth from two
Turquoises, both so perfect."

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.810 align:middle line:90%
He chose turquoise deliberately.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Warriors place it on
body armor and swords,

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
for it was believed to make
them invulnerable in battle.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.630 align:middle line:84%
But there's an in-joke here
because Elizabeth's pet name

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:40.580 align:middle line:84%
for Oxford was her
Turk, and he's saying he

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:47.300 align:middle line:84%
is the turquoise, the very
root of this golden tree.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:84%
He continues, "Vesta
sitteth in the midst"--

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Vesta is the Roman
goddess whose temple was

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:90%
guarded by the Vestal Virgins--

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
--"whereat Cupid is ever drawing
his bow, but dares not shoot,

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
being amazed at the princely
and perfect Majesty."

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
He's saying the queen is
this unequal tree of the sun,

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.450 align:middle line:90%
and he is the root.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.340 align:middle line:10%
This is a scandalous
thing to say in public.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.160 align:middle line:10%
He's either telling the
world he and the Queen

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:10%
share the greatest
love ever, or it's

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:10%
a declaration of utter
selfless service,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.350 align:middle line:10%
the chivalry of a courtier
knight for his prince.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
And he means it.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Finally, he declares
he will prove himself

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.410 align:middle line:84%
in the contest to only be the
Knight of the Tree of the Sun.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And whosoever wisheth to prove
him wrong, let them come,

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
for he would rather die upon
the points of a thousand lances

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.595 align:middle line:84%
than yield one jot
in constant loyalty.

00:16:52.595 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.487 align:middle line:84%
Everyone who can hear
is stunned into silence.

00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And for those who couldn't
hear, the entire speech

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.890 align:middle line:90%
was quickly printed up for sale.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And then the contests began.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
His adversaries were
more eager than ever

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.829 align:middle line:84%
to crush him for his
insufferable bragging.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.829 align:middle line:84%
What they could
not see, however,

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.060 align:middle line:84%
was this was not
arrogance or even

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:84%
an incomprehensibly
extravagant mind game

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.119 align:middle line:90%
to psych out his opponents.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Oxford had simply
fixed his heart

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
on unwavering loyalty
to Queen and country.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:39.960 align:middle line:84%
He had no fear, no
doubt of the outcome.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:90%
He was, indeed, invulnerable.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And 12 contests of
strength and valor

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:84%
later, Oxford had won every
single one for his Queen.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.390 align:middle line:84%
So why the metaphor of Elizabeth
being the goddess Vesta?

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:10%
In ancient Rome,
the Vestal Virgins

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:10%
had to vow 30 years
of chastity to become

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:10%
priestesses of Vesta's Temple.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:12.510 align:middle line:10%
Their virginity was considered
essential to Rome's survival.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Vesta's Temple was one of
Rome's most essential centers

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.230 align:middle line:90%
of worship.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Its altar was a sacred
fire, and the Vestals

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:84%
were charged with
keeping it ever burning.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Rome believed their very
survival depended on it.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Oxford was saying in the
most public way possible

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:84%
that he understood
England's survival depended

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
just the same on maintaining the
myth of Elizabeth's virginity.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:90%
Whether true or not--

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:84%
and his message was
certainly ambiguous--

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
politically, her availability
to European suitors

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.410 align:middle line:84%
was the only thing that
had kept the Spanish

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:90%
from invading so far.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:10%
Certainly, de Vere spent
much of his life dedicated

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:10%
to that promise of
courtier knight loyalty

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.690 align:middle line:10%
through his timeless works.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.020 align:middle line:10%
Let us see how.

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.470 align:middle line:10%
The pyramidion at the
pinnacle of this structure

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:10%
is represented by the
bath sonnets, 153 and 154.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.920 align:middle line:10%
Both are the same story but
written in different tones.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Each references the
moon goddess Diana.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.460 align:middle line:84%
"Nymphs that vowed
chaste life to keep"--

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:90%
that's the Vestal Virgins.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Each also references the sun
god, "holy fire of love."

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.760 align:middle line:84%
These are the
opposites that must

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.360 align:middle line:84%
be balanced to achieve
the alchemical wedding

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
of heat-cold,
light-dark, male-female.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:10%
It's all there but
in a nuanced way.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:50.900 align:middle line:10%
153 has the more sexual heat
associated with the sun god

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:10%
Sol.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.640 align:middle line:10%
154 tends toward the chastity
of the moon goddess Luna.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.280 align:middle line:10%
The final line, "Love's
fire heats water;

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.280 align:middle line:10%
water cools not
love," is literally

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.960 align:middle line:10%
the sacred obligation
of the Vestal

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.160 align:middle line:10%
Virgins, keepers of
the eternal flame.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:10%
The four occurrences
of the word bath

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.380 align:middle line:10%
carry the double meaning
of the alchemical bath

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:10%
in which the great work of the
philosopher's stone is done.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:10%
But also, they are references
to the Roman Baths,

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:10%
particularly the very
popular mineral springs

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.920 align:middle line:10%
in the city of Bath, Somerset.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.070 align:middle line:84%
When the Romans
vanquished the Celts,

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:35.560 align:middle line:84%
they found them
worshipping their goddess

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.760 align:middle line:90%
of medicine and healing, Sulis.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
They claimed ownership of
the Indigenous sacred site,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
of course, and built an
immense temple complex

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:90%
adjoining the baths.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
On one side of the courtyard
is a temple dedicated

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.020 align:middle line:90%
to Sol, their sun god.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.350 align:middle line:84%
On the other side is the Temple
of Luna, their moon goddess.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:00.390 align:middle line:10%
And in the center is the
most important temple of all,

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:10%
dedicated to their newly-created
hybrid deity, Sulis Minerva.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.475 align:middle line:10%
Minerva was Rome's
most important goddess,

00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:15.540 align:middle line:10%
but one fully formed
from the head of Jupiter

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.340 align:middle line:10%
shaking a spear.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:10%


00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.160 align:middle line:10%
It's clear his fellow writers
and Rosie Cross initiates

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:10%
understood the spear-shaken
metaphor Oxford was developing.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.920 align:middle line:10%
Witness this book published
in 1612, "Minerva Britanna,"

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.950 align:middle line:10%
Britain's Minerva,
the cover of which

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:38.610 align:middle line:10%
features the hand of a
hidden author in the process

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:10%
of writing the letter I from
behind a theatrical curtain.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:10%
Are we starting to see
his Minerva persona built

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.500 align:middle line:10%
into the bath sonnets
with Elizabeth

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.035 align:middle line:10%
as the Vestal Virgin
goddess at the center?

00:21:52.035 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Cupid is Eros.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
Eros is the son of Venus, sun.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:10%
Diana is the moon.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:10%
Artists were constantly
comparing Elizabeth,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:10%
the virgin queen, to Diana.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.610 align:middle line:10%
Here's a painting equating
her with the goddess herself.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
This painting portrays a beauty
contest between Venus, Minerva,

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.460 align:middle line:84%
and Juno in which Elizabeth
is depicted as the winner.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.190 align:middle line:10%
Its Latin inscription
translates,

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:10%
"The ROSIE face of Venus
was shining bright,

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:36.590 align:middle line:10%
but then came Elizabeth
and outshone them all."

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.800 align:middle line:10%
The artist has placed
Elizabeth atop three

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:10%
ascending levels, the
three initiatory degrees

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:48.110 align:middle line:10%
of Freemasonry, clearly a
nod from a fellow Rosie Cross

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:10%
initiate.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
By depicting Elizabeth
above the Rosie Venus,

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
the painter is equating her
with the mother of Eros,

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:01.000 align:middle line:84%
just as Oxford did in
his oration at the tilts.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.840 align:middle line:84%
Ben Jonson, a fellow poet,
wrote a masque for court

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
in which two cupids, Eros
and Anteros, are arguing.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.490 align:middle line:10%
Their conflict escalates
into a full-blown jousting

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:10%
contest until their
differences are reconciled

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:20.350 align:middle line:10%
by a god who declares,
you are both true cupids

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:29.290 align:middle line:10%
and both the sons of Venus, but
the firstborn was called Eros.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.630 align:middle line:84%
He then explains
that Anteros' role

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:40.780 align:middle line:84%
is to balance Eros' erotic
sexual love with selfless love

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.990 align:middle line:90%
based on mutual reciprocation.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.380 align:middle line:84%
It's clear Jonson was using
the tilt metaphor to explain

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:84%
the double meaning
behind Oxford's "Knight

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:55.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Tree of the Sunne"
speech, and he put it plainly.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.770 align:middle line:84%
Eros is the firstborn
of the god's offspring

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:04.345 align:middle line:84%
and is therefore the
firstborn son of light.

00:24:04.345 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.330 align:middle line:84%
But still, we have
three statements

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.530 align:middle line:90%
with nothing connecting them.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.850 align:middle line:90%
There has to be more.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:19.590 align:middle line:84%
Note how the pyramidion
also resembles cupid's arrow

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.140 align:middle line:90%
shooting skyward.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:90%
But what is it pointing to?

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the crowns
and the central problem

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that both unites and divides
de Vere and Elizabeth--

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.750 align:middle line:90%
to be or not to be the king?

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Does the conundrum of
Eros-Anteros, sexual love

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
versus chivalric
love, actually give us

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:90%
the solution we're looking for?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:90%
I believe so.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Many scholars have speculated
that the queen and Oxford had

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
an affair from 1572 to
'74, and I've already

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.860 align:middle line:84%
told you about their
three private visits

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
with the Archbishop
of Canterbury.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, if they
were secretly married,

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.420 align:middle line:84%
which the codes in the
last episode seemed to say,

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.670 align:middle line:84%
they understood the
political necessity

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
of keeping the
arrangement secret.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:84%
There was no way their
love affair could play out

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.340 align:middle line:90%
in public.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And if there was
a child coming, it

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.950 align:middle line:84%
would have to be hidden away
into a surrogate family,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:84%
as happened frequently with
Elizabeth's father, King Henry

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.950 align:middle line:90%
VIII.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:90%
So is this the solution?

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:47.930 align:middle line:84%
"First son, born of the divine
Elizabeth and I, de Vere,

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:53.030 align:middle line:90%
the crown's Rosicrucian light."

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:56.690 align:middle line:84%
As any parent knows, your child
is the light of your life.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
Describing theirs as the
crown's Rosie Cross light

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.950 align:middle line:90%
would be perfectly fitting.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:10%
On the other hand, there's
ambiguity in the bath sonnets

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:18.080 align:middle line:10%
as well as in Oxford's oratory
that might be explained thus.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.140 align:middle line:10%
When Princess
Elizabeth was only 14,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:10%
she lived for a while in
the home of the dowager

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:10%
Queen Catherine Parre,
King Henry VIII's widow,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:10%
who had recently married Thomas
Seymour, the reckless Lord

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.770 align:middle line:10%
Admiral.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:36.410 align:middle line:84%
The house servants reported
incidents of Seymour

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:41.990 align:middle line:84%
initiating inappropriate bedroom
play with the young princess.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:46.040 align:middle line:84%
A scandal ensued, and Seymour
was executed for treason,

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.680 align:middle line:84%
including efforts to
manipulate the young princess

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:53.170 align:middle line:84%
into marriage by
impregnating her.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
There were rumors she
had become pregnant

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.780 align:middle line:84%
and that the child was placed
into an aristocratic family's

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:84%
home as, once again, had been
the norm with her father's

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.100 align:middle line:90%
many bastard children.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.430 align:middle line:84%
A simple rearrangement reveals
another perfectly credible

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:90%
solution for this code.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:18.740 align:middle line:84%
"I, de Vere, firstborn
son of Elizabeth,

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:24.490 align:middle line:84%
I am the crown's
Rosicrucian light."

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:29.350 align:middle line:84%
In this case, de Vere himself
would be the Rosicrucian light

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and hope of the crown,
a legitimate successor

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.690 align:middle line:90%
to continue the Tudor dynasty.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
I have to say that to find
such ambiguity is very unusual.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Virtually all the
codes I've deciphered

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
have been crystal
clear in their meaning.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.960 align:middle line:90%
So which do you think is true?

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Why is he so intent on saying
he's the rightful king?

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.550 align:middle line:90%
Were they secretly married?

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Was he her firstborn heir?

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Would he, indeed, have
gone to such lengths

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate the
Eros-Anteros dichotomy

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.832 align:middle line:84%
in this masterful cryptographic
work if at least one

00:28:13.832 --> 00:28:15.415 align:middle line:84%
of these solutions
were not the truth?

00:28:15.415 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's the attention to
detail that's so convincing.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Perfection like this simply
doesn't happen by accident.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.760 align:middle line:10%
And as John Dee's
trademark, as he

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:10%
wrote in his "Monas
Hieroglyphica," "In it,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.945 align:middle line:10%
there be not even
one superfluous dot

00:28:31.945 --> 00:28:34.870 align:middle line:10%
- and not one dot wanting."

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:84%
Even the punctuation
has to be perfect.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I am, comma, Elizabeth,
comma, the crown's

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:84%
apostrophe Rosicrucian
light, period.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, for
both of them, period.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:55.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:90%
[DING]

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.450 align:middle line:10%
The question, to be
or not to be the king,

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:06.570 align:middle line:10%
was, of course,
answered definitively

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:10%
by the Queen's refusal right
up to the moment of her passing

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.230 align:middle line:10%
to name an heir.

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But as Shakespeare said in
"The Merchant of Venice,"

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:84%
"Truth will out," for the
answer awaits us right here,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:38.360 align:middle line:84%
inside the Holy of Holies,
the altar, the dvir.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Remember what he
said in sonnet 121?

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:90%
"I am that I am."

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
The "to be" part,
the name of God

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.810 align:middle line:84%
so central to this entire
story from the very beginning

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and to be used only by divine
right bestowed on kings.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Yet in the next breath, he
states the "not to be" part.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:10.530 align:middle line:84%
"By their rank thoughts, my
deeds must not be shown."

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And he is the writer,
producer, director, and star

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.950 align:middle line:90%
of this drama.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:middle line:90%
Parts of it are comedies.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Parts are certainly tragedies.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:31.250 align:middle line:10%
But in the end, in the
center, it's all his story.

I expect everyone has their own
particular favorite Shakespeare

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:90%
quote.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.180 align:middle line:84%
One of mine is, "All
the world's a stage,

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and all the men and
women merely players."

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:58.430 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, he's just
saying the choice is always ours

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:07.370 align:middle line:84%
to be or not to be who we
really are, the I am that I am.

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.370 align:middle line:90%
