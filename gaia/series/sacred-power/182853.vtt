00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Medical intuition is
a new emerging science.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.110 align:middle line:84%
The term sounds so
mysterious, really,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.940 align:middle line:84%
but our energy system is
designed to speak to us

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and to keep us healthy
and to report in anything

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.400 align:middle line:90%
that threatens our life force--

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.120 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And so when I talk
about medical intuition,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
our natural capacity

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to read the energetic data
that says what you're doing

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:90%
is bad for your health.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:59.640 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:10%
I'm Caroline Myss, and
welcome to "Sacred Power."

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.430 align:middle line:10%
Everybody is born with
intuitive intelligence.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Our body has an energy system,
but so does everything else.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
I began my work as a
medical intuitive in 1983,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
when I became able to sense
illness in other people.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
What child archetype
do you identify with?

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Abandoned.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.860 align:middle line:10%
>> There we go.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.600 align:middle line:10%
And at that time, I had
co-founded a publishing company

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:10%
that was dedicated to producing
books about consciousness,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.510 align:middle line:10%
health, and alternative
or complementary medicine.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
But life, as we all know,
is a curious journey.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And now, 35 years later, I've
charted the human energy system

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
and explored for years the
many patterns of stress

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
that underlie the
development of illnesses.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
99% of the time, you are
listening to this intuition,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:84%
responding to it, and
never even notice it.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.810 align:middle line:84%
But the important lesson I
want to communicate to you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.380 align:middle line:84%
is that you, like me, have
an inner medical intuitive

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.930 align:middle line:90%
system working inside of you.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Your intuitive
intelligence is not a gift,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and attuning yourself to
your medical intuition

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.100 align:middle line:90%
requires knowledge.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.200 align:middle line:90%
It requires information.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.630 align:middle line:84%
The more you know about
your energy system,

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.170 align:middle line:84%
the more you'll recognize
the energetic signals,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
the data that you
receive through your gut

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.790 align:middle line:84%
instincts and your intuitive
feelings all the time, 24/7.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition is never
not communicating with you.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So now what do I
mean by intuition?

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Your intuition is
your natural ability

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.910 align:middle line:84%
to not just sense
energetic data that

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
fills this dimension
of the invisible world,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but to interpret it, to
understand energetic data.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We always get energetic
messages such as, "I shouldn't

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
eat this" or "I
ought to exercise"

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:84%
or "I ought to
call this person."

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a problem
actually hearing those messages,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.160 align:middle line:84%
because they're not life
threatening necessarily.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.050 align:middle line:84%
So basic kind of ground
level, intuitive hits,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.030 align:middle line:90%
we don't have any problem with.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
But when things get a
little bit more complicated,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
then we start jamming our
circuits, especially about

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:90%
our health.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:84%
We don't necessarily want to
hear those energetic messages.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's a funny
thing about intuition.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
We often reduce this
amazing resource

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%
to a fortune telling device.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
We want it to be
something that protects us

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
from losing money
or making mistakes.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.280 align:middle line:84%
People go to
psychics because they

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
think that they have this
capacity to see the future

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:90%
or to--

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, am I going
to get this job or am

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I going to win the lottery
or what's this person doing?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:84%
We think that there's such
a thing as a skill that

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.794 align:middle line:90%
can predict the future.

00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But my role is to
introduce to you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.430 align:middle line:84%
the truth that this
inner resource of yours

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, a mystical
skill, a mystical attribute.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.740 align:middle line:84%
That your inner voice is part
of your cosmic guidance system.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of its primary
purposes is the management

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of your health, the
management of your well-being.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It is your deepest inner
navigating quality.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And so to that extent, I'm going
to teach you, introduce you

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to yourself as your
own medical intuitive.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And so for that, I'm going
to need my whiteboard.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.060 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take
you on an inner journey

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:90%
inside of yourself.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you
what your energy anatomy

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.650 align:middle line:90%
system looks like.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.470 align:middle line:84%
The first thing I'm
going to do is show you

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.690 align:middle line:90%
what you look like to me.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.157 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're going to be
awfully glad that this

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is one of the few
drawings you're ever

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.410 align:middle line:84%
going to see from
me, but this is

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
my best way to illustrate to
you and give you an image--

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:90%
kind of a functional image--

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:84%
of how you should
understand yourself.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%
This is you.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm putting you
in an energy field,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.860 align:middle line:84%
because you do live
in an energy field.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.575 align:middle line:84%
And in an ideal world,
you have energy coming in

00:06:08.575 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
through the top
of your body here.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:90%
That's you.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Now when I do a reading on
you as a medical intuitive,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:84%
all the time people will say to
me, oh, well, what do you see

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and what do you sense?

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.940 align:middle line:90%
And here's what's true.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I don't see anything.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
I want you to image
where you're living

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.470 align:middle line:90%
and think about that image.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you actually see it?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.740 align:middle line:90%
And you would say no.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you hear it?

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:90%
And you would say no.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
The world of image is its
own type of perception.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
So when I do a
reading, I receive

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:84%
images that are just
like the ones you now

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.000 align:middle line:84%
have in trying to
recall your living room.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And they download at
the speed of light.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.620 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that when
I get your living room,

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I have absolutely
no emotion about it.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not my living room.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:90%
It's yours.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's very easy for me to
look around your living room

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:84%
and see what's broken
and what's not.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you look
around your living room,

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:84%
you're emotionally
attached to everything.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.080 align:middle line:10%
So it's much more
difficult for you

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.552 align:middle line:10%
to look around your living
room with detachment.

00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
Now you remember that
word, because we're

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:90%
going to refer to it again.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's how an
intuitive reading works.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just energetic
data, and that's it.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is you.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:45.170 align:middle line:84%
In an ideal world, you are
contained in this energy field.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.280 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Now this is a graphic
representation

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of the energy that is coursing
through your body at all times.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
In order to become your
own intuitive healer,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.260 align:middle line:84%
you need to
recognize this energy

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.510 align:middle line:84%
and notice when you are
leaking energy, which

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:90%
is another word for power.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.340 align:middle line:84%
For example, you will
instantly leak power

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
when you get news
that scares you.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And for most of us, we
will feel it in our stomach

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:84%
or you might feel
it as a headache.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.690 align:middle line:84%
You'll take the energy hit
in your center, where you are

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:90%
most susceptible to that issue.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Fear usually hits
you in the gut,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
because bad news makes
you feel vulnerable.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.440 align:middle line:90%
So first, you feel it here.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:84%
And then because energy centers
are not Tupperware containers,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.740 align:middle line:90%
energy is never contained.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.777 align:middle line:84%
Your body will share that stress
with every part of your body,

00:08:34.777 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and you'll need to think
about what just happened.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:10%
And that's the job
of the sixth chakra.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.809 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll need to
execute your next move.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:46.490 align:middle line:10%
So everything moves
to the fifth chakra.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Think of all of these as your
working energetic laboratories.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.800 align:middle line:84%
The upper part of the hourglass
is your activity center,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
where the energy will
process all of your thoughts

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:84%
together and then
determine how that will

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:90%
be used in your external world.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And then right
here in the middle,

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
our heart center, that's
where we get log jammed.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:84%
The heart center
is where we process

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.260 align:middle line:84%
our fears, our enthusiasm, our
emotions, our expectations,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.430 align:middle line:84%
and this includes the terror
of sudden changes in our lives.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't want our world
to change in ways that we've

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.180 align:middle line:84%
not planned for, we
hold back the stress

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:84%
that builds from not making
clear and conscious choices.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Up here, we negotiate.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:90%
We tell ourselves stories.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.070 align:middle line:84%
We tell our heart we
don't feel so bad,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:90%
this isn't that stressful.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's all because
we're terrified of change,

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
and we want to try to
control the speed at which

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.370 align:middle line:90%
our physical world changes.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:90%
So the energy comes in.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.680 align:middle line:90%
You look as a resource.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And then imagine that it goes
back to energy and into matter.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
science of physics.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.100 align:middle line:90%
We're not going to go there.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:90%
You're relieved.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.870 align:middle line:84%
But in a reading,
what I do is I track

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
you and I track what I call
your anchors, which means this.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.370 align:middle line:84%
All of you are in power
plays with someone.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has
unfinished business.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has some kind of
thing they're attached to.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has what, in Buddha
language, is called cravings--

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:90%
things they crave.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.430 align:middle line:84%
People's attention they
crave, substances they crave,

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:90%
stuff, sugar, drugs, alcohol--

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:90%
cravings.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:84%
This energy comes out and a
choice directs your energy

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
to the target that you
crave, to the person

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
you're trying to control,
to something that you

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:84%
are holding onto,
that you shouldn't

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:90%
be holding onto anymore.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is that it
punctures your energy field

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:90%
and it attaches to something.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:90%
And we call this an anchor.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle line:90%
This could be a trauma.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.130 align:middle line:84%
This could be a bad
relationship you can't get over.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, we
accumulate these anchors.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:84%
The number of anchors we
have creates our relationship

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:90%
to time.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:90%
This is a formula.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Each of these anchors
creates weight.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.080 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.240 align:middle line:90%
W-E-I-G-H-T-- weight.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.260 align:middle line:84%
This is all psychic weight, and
I'll tell you how this works.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
If I said to you, "Here's
a great job opportunity

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's just perfect for you,"
if you hit a lot of anchors,

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:90%
this is what you would do.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
You would think, oh, I'd love
to take it, but what about this?

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if I could do
it because I'm attached to this

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:84%
and because what
would this person do?

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And you would go through all
of your anchors, every one

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of them, before
you said to me, "I

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.640 align:middle line:90%
don't know if I should do that."

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Because your anchors
would come first.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
Because your anchors create
weight in your head--

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
psychic weight-- and that
equals creating wait.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to wait longer
for change to happen.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Now this is how we create time.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:84%
This is the formula for how
we create time right here.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've heard
the word chakras.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows that word.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But I want to take
you inside the way

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I see it, the way I first
took a look at it years ago.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:10%
And out of that came my
work on the human energy

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:10%
system and a body of work
called energy anatomy.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the best way for me
to do this is to draw again.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.770 align:middle line:90%
Brace yourself.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--
these are the seven chakras.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine that I'm
taking you into yourself,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.710 align:middle line:84%
and I'm hitting a light
and it's lighting up.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And you are looking at
yourself and how you are wired,

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and these wires have been
talking to you all along.

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't know how you
work, if you don't get it,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
miss these signals.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
Because every one
of the chakras--

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
think about this.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like going into
a secret garden that's

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.710 align:middle line:84%
an entire universe unto
itself, a universe.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how
incredible you are?

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about a
window into your soul.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:84%
The reason why your
system is talking to you

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:18.430 align:middle line:84%
is because the higher order
is to keep you balanced,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.780 align:middle line:84%
to always keep you
balanced, to keep you

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:27.250 align:middle line:84%
in the state of
health, to keep you

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
like a perfect tree in
the state of balance.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Because your system resonates
to the law of nature.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's go inside.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Chakra one-- now,
you're an hourglass.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
This is my version
of an hourglass.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.750 align:middle line:10%
The bottom half is
your physical world.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:10%
The top half is your
energetic world.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
The bottom half deals
with your relationship

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.560 align:middle line:84%
to your physical world, the
top to your energetic world.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.250 align:middle line:84%
The bottom half
to your external,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:90%
the top to your internal.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It's so logical.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:90%
The turning point is your heart.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.120 align:middle line:84%
And then we go up
to 5, 6, and 7.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
Everything below your
waist is survival.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra has a sacred
truth, and each chakra

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:36.760 align:middle line:84%
has specific organs,
effects, and issues.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So let's go into
your first chakra.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.290 align:middle line:84%
The first chakra
is wide, because it

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:90%
has wide bodied information.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.630 align:middle line:10%
The sacred truth of the
first chakra is "all is one."

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So some effects of
chakra one are lower back

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:84%
pain, depression, and
obsessive-compulsive behavior.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is how
your body talks to you

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.370 align:middle line:84%
through the effects
you see in your body.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:84%
If I was doing a reading on
you and I hit the first chakra,

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.460 align:middle line:90%
what am I looking for?

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
I am looking for
tribal information.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I am looking for your data
about where you come from,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.010 align:middle line:90%
your family.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
This is the roots of
your tree, all of this.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.050 align:middle line:84%
All the significant data
that was poured into you

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:84%
from the day you were born
till you were seven years old

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:90%
is in here.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:84%
The maximum habits of
your tribe that you

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
learn by observation,
the tribal respect,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
standing up when elders come
in the room, your loyalties

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.550 align:middle line:84%
to the tribe, your
sense of patriotism--

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:90%
all of this is right here.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%
Right here.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:84%
Whether or not you
feel you belong

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.200 align:middle line:84%
when I do a reading
on someone and I sense

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.570 align:middle line:90%
this person is ungrounded--

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.540 align:middle line:84%
you know what that
word means, ungrounded?

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.790 align:middle line:90%
It means no roots.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.040 align:middle line:84%
I get that data
from the lower part.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it from your elbow.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it from your neck.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.319 align:middle line:90%
It's this part.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:90%
So this is all tribal.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, we need tribal connections.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
We are not balanced
without tribal connections.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And believe you me, that's
in this part of your body.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Now from tribal, we go to
one-on-one relationships,

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:90%
which--

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:90%
look at your body--

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:84%
your second chakra, your
lower back, your sexual area,

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.050 align:middle line:84%
is designed for
one-on-one contact.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.790 align:middle line:84%
This is your
reproductive system.

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred truth of this
chakra is "honor one another."

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
Some effects you
would see here would

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.770 align:middle line:84%
be arthritis, sciatica, urinary
illnesses, colon illness,

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.430 align:middle line:84%
sexual potency, and
sexual diseases,

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.790 align:middle line:90%
as well as fertility issues.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.270 align:middle line:10%
This is also the
area of your body

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:10%
where all the stress
with another person

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.620 align:middle line:10%
is going to be revealed.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:90%
So watch this.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.100 align:middle line:90%
This is where our weapons are.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.040 align:middle line:84%
This is where our fear
of being raped is.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
It's the fear of being
attacked not just physically,

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
but it's the fear of
being verbally attacked.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:10%
It's the fear of being
abandoned and left out

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.620 align:middle line:10%
of a power circle
that's forming,

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.500 align:middle line:10%
power systems that
are forming, secrets

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:10%
that you're being kept out of.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this fascinating?

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting,
I can hardly stand it.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.140 align:middle line:84%
We reveal everything
in our energy system.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.210 align:middle line:84%
We really are open,
energetic books.

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is also the center of
us that says we have to create.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Look at us.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
We're designed to create.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.770 align:middle line:84%
This is also your
fight or flight

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.850 align:middle line:84%
system that compels you
to get up and leave.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Did you ever see anyone who
sits and they sit like this?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And they lean over because
they're intimidated.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You give yourself where
you're going to cover up

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:90%
your fight or flight area.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.420 align:middle line:84%
When you say-- when people say,
"You stabbed me in the back,"

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and if I said you, "Exactly
where do you feel that,"

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.953 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to say,
"Actually, right here."

00:19:28.953 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Because you're talking
about-- if you're

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.860 align:middle line:84%
going to use the phrase "it
stabbed me in the back,"

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
it's because you feel someone
betrayed you great, big, huge.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.670 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to point here.

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:84%
You'll point your
second chakra always.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.200 align:middle line:90%
There's no exception to this.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.050 align:middle line:84%
You will never,
ever, ever say, well,

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
they stabbed me
actually right here.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
You're always referring to some
act of ruthless betrayal that

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
happened financially,
sexually, one-on-one

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:84%
in an intimate relationship,
and you're going down here.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
This here is your
unreasonable animal appetite.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Then we go to your
relationship with yourself,

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.000 align:middle line:90%
which is here on number three.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.140 align:middle line:10%
When you have a
pain in your stomach

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.860 align:middle line:10%
because something's intimidating
you, close your eyes

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:10%
and go into yourself
and say, something

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:10%
is threatening my survival.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.000 align:middle line:90%
That's the words you need.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And you, as your medical
intuitive, you go into yourself

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and think, "I have
a stomach pain.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:84%
I have a pain in my
lower back, because I'm

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:84%
feeling like something's
threatening my survival."

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.974 align:middle line:84%
And your whole system will tell
you how much, where, and who.

00:20:48.974 --> 00:20:50.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:84%
This chakra is eating disorders,
diabetes, and indigestion.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:84%
This is where you begin
to get into identity

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:84%
issues, the inner
sufferings of who you are.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:84%
Depression is also related
to this center, as well as

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:10.400 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, social identity,
survival crises, fear

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
of rejection, and
issues of belonging.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:10%
So it makes sense
that the sacred truth

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.750 align:middle line:10%
of the third chakra
is "honor one's self."

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So let me point out that
you go from tribal issues

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.340 align:middle line:84%
to one-on-one and
then to yourself.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
This is the center
of self esteem,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:90%
how you esteem yourself.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
This is your center
of integrity.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:43.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of the things that
I'm talking to about, all

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:84%
of these many issues that
are in these chakras,

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you about so that
you get a sense of power.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Power.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember, our operative
word is power.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So that you have a sense of
what causes you to lose power.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
You ever get in one-on-one
power struggles with people?

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Do you ever think "I'm
being intimidated"?

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Does that person
have more than me?

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Am I afraid of being left out?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Are all your insecurities
about money and power?

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:90%
All of that causes you--

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:90%
look at this, here you are--

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.280 align:middle line:90%
to see the world--

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.440 align:middle line:84%
see the world,
this is the world--

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:90%
as a frightening place.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
you make choices.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And those choices cause
you to lose power.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Think of people in
your life you think

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:84%
intimidate you or threaten
you or, in some way,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
deliberately exclude you and
how often you stress about them.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
Anything you stress
about and I promise you,

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:84%
you're losing power
and they are anchors.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And your whole system
will tell you how much,

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:84%
where, and who, because
it's a map to your world.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:11.800 align:middle line:90%
Your biography is your biology.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.810 align:middle line:90%
Now, up we go.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.820 align:middle line:90%
Number four is your heart.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.630 align:middle line:90%
This is your emotional.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:21.610 align:middle line:84%
This is your-- but
it's not just emotions.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.360 align:middle line:84%
That's like reducing
the ocean to a big pond.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:10%
This is how you relate
to emotion, what emotion

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:37.210 align:middle line:10%
is, your capacity to manage
yourself within emotion,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.910 align:middle line:10%
to conduct yourself
with an emotion,

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:10%
to understand what is wrath,
to handle anger, whether anger

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:10%
handles you or you handle
anger, to even understand

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.040 align:middle line:10%
the nature of emotion.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.310 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:10%
This is also the capacity for
generosity and forgiveness,

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.860 align:middle line:10%
for compassion, the
gifts of the heart,

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:10%
the whole health of the heart.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So it makes sense that
what you see in your body

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
is congestive heart failure,
heart attack, lung cancer,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.710 align:middle line:84%
upper back and shoulder pain,
as well as breast cancer.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And the sacred truth is
"love is divine power."

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.370 align:middle line:84%
Divine power-- back
to that word again.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.185 align:middle line:90%
It's all about power.

00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:25.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the turning
point between whether you

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:84%
handle your life or
your life handles you.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.900 align:middle line:84%
Right here, this one--
this is the major player.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
This, the nature of
love and your heart.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Whether you use love as
a weapon or you allow

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.010 align:middle line:90%
love to work through you.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:50.038 align:middle line:90%
This is the major deal.

00:24:50.038 --> 00:24:51.080 align:middle line:90%
This is the deal breaker.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:51.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Up we go.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.980 align:middle line:90%
Fifth is your throat.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.520 align:middle line:90%
This is your center of choice.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the
choices you've made

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.130 align:middle line:84%
or the ones you believe
you have not made

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.880 align:middle line:84%
or the choices you feel have
kept you hostage because they

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.792 align:middle line:84%
were made for you by someone
else and you can't get over it.

00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:12.520 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.080 align:middle line:84%
The power of every single
choice you make at this chakra

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.450 align:middle line:84%
determines if you will
live a life of blame

00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
or a life of personal
accountability

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.350 align:middle line:90%
and responsibility.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:84%
The sacred truth in this chakra
is "surrender personal will

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:90%
to the divine."

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.020 align:middle line:84%
This is where you really get
in touch with how powerful

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:90%
a single choice is.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.530 align:middle line:90%
Who's in charge of you?

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:90%
Who's in charge of your choices?

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.830 align:middle line:84%
Will you speak out if you
witness an act of cruelty

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.130 align:middle line:84%
or walk away pretending
not to notice at all?

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.770 align:middle line:84%
You'll see this

through raspy throat, chronic
sore throat, mouth ulcers, TMJ,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
thyroid conditions,
addiction, shoving things

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:05.590 align:middle line:84%
into your mouth to jam your
choices, and also addiction.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Choice is power.

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Power-- big, huge.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.520 align:middle line:90%
Every choice you make matters.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:20.203 align:middle line:84%
Choice-- this is your mind,
and this is the connection

00:26:20.203 --> 00:26:21.003 align:middle line:90%
of your spirit--

00:26:21.003 --> 00:26:25.165 align:middle line:90%


00:26:25.165 --> 00:26:27.040 align:middle line:84%
it's very hard for me
to write at this angle,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.900 align:middle line:90%
but that's a spirit--

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.590 align:middle line:90%
to your soul.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:41.380 align:middle line:84%
This is your remarkable capacity
of how you structure reality

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:84%
for yourself, the tools with
which you structure reality.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:48.850 align:middle line:90%
What you tell yourself is--

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:51.760 align:middle line:84%
here's an operative
word-- possible.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:58.360 align:middle line:84%
What you've decided in your mind
is possible in your universe.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.340 align:middle line:84%
What you've decided
is impossible.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:06.820 align:middle line:84%
The sacred truth of the sixth
chakra is "seek only truth."

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.380 align:middle line:90%
Now, truth has many levels.

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We start out with personal
truth well before we

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.050 align:middle line:90%
encounter cosmic truth.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.500 align:middle line:84%
It begins with a hard core,
rigorous self-examination.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.490 align:middle line:84%
And then we further look into
what's going on around here.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:23.830 align:middle line:90%
Climate change, for example--

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:27.360 align:middle line:84%
I may not want climate
change to be a real thing,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:84%
but what I want is no longer
what determines what truth is.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It's the cosmic truth
that starts to matter.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that climate
change is happening,

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:90%
whether I want it to or not.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
When we are blocking truth, it
tends to erupt more suddenly.

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.660 align:middle line:90%
We get angry a lot.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Our mind creates
false narratives

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:84%
that reinforce our positions
in the world, for example.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And that can produce
blood pressure issues.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.897 align:middle line:90%
It can produce stress.

00:27:56.897 --> 00:27:58.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we're telling
ourselves things

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.190 align:middle line:90%
that are simply not true.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And then that stress shows
itself in relationships,

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:90%
in our jobs.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Because, essentially,
we're living a lie.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And this looks different
for every person.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Some have gotten good
at negotiating truth,

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:90%
but not for long.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.960 align:middle line:84%
Eventually truth wants
to come out in our lives,

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's the
truth for everybody.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.825 align:middle line:84%
How do you construct
your reality?

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:90%


00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:35.332 align:middle line:84%
Your sixth chakra-- if I said
to you take me into your energy

00:28:35.332 --> 00:28:37.790 align:middle line:84%
field right now, I want to see
what you've done to your six

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:40.430 align:middle line:84%
chakra, get me in
there right now,

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.410 align:middle line:84%
I want to see how
you talk to yourself.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.220 align:middle line:10%
People will tell themselves,
well, I'm not forgiving

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.800 align:middle line:10%
or I'm stubborn.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.250 align:middle line:84%
And they use words
like that to conduct

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.220 align:middle line:90%
the whole of their reality.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.070 align:middle line:90%
That's the power of this.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:59.120 align:middle line:84%
How you have, brick by brick--
and every brick's a word--

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.700 align:middle line:84%
word by word, structured
the person you want to be.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.630 align:middle line:84%
How you have, word by
word, give and decided

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.780 align:middle line:90%
what to empower yourself with.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.300 align:middle line:84%
By the choice of
how you've decided

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.380 align:middle line:84%
you would be forgiving or
unforgiving, whole or broken

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
because of an event
that happened somewhere

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:90%
in your history.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.440 align:middle line:90%
This is the human energy system.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:90%
These are not circles.

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the power that is
inside of you, and it is sacred,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.000 align:middle line:90%
and it is amazing.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.800 align:middle line:84%
You are the most
extraordinary being.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing
ordinary about you.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.640 align:middle line:84%
You weren't born for something
extraordinary you are

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:90%
extraordinary by divine design.

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.050 align:middle line:10%
And when you
understand your design,

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:56.840 align:middle line:10%
you understand that
the nature of God

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:04.450 align:middle line:10%
is to speak through you, through
your bio-spiritual ecology.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:90%
This is who you are.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.540 align:middle line:84%
You are a natural
medical intuitive.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:90%
