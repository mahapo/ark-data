>> It is astonishing to me
that people will say, oh,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.329 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in evil,
but I believe in good,

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.530 align:middle line:84%
as if human beings no
longer have a dark side.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's allowed us to be
abusive environmentally,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
abusive to nature,
abusive to human beings,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.710 align:middle line:84%
because we decided that not
only is there no evil out there,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:90%
there is no evil in here.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Evil is not very popular today.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.290 align:middle line:84%
We actually prefer
the topic of good.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.200 align:middle line:84%
We love to talk about angels,
but when it comes to the word

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:90%
evil, we recoil in horror.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
You know, many
people I meet, they

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
wear amulets or crystals
to protect their energy.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But I always wonder, what are
they protecting themselves

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:05.570 align:middle line:90%
from?

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:90%
And I'll ask them.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say negativity,
but they can't actually

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:90%
say the word "evil."

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, why does going anywhere
near the word "evil" terrify

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.880 align:middle line:90%
us?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've thought
about it so long.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to realize
that the reason is actually

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:90%
profound.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.370 align:middle line:84%
We have more belief in evil
than we think and fear of it.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And people won't
acknowledge that.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And by forcing evil
underground, we've essentially

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:84%
formed a partnership
with it in ways

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that are conscious
and unconscious,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.590 align:middle line:90%
but it's the truth.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:90%
And here is the big headline.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Evil counts on you
not believing in it.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.922 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share
a story with you,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:90%
because it changed my life.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.210 align:middle line:90%
I think it was--

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:84%
I probably was around
20 years old there

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:84%
was a front-page story in
"The Tribune," front page.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And this man had just gotten
out of a satanic cult. And of

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:84%
course, who believes
in that, right?

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:90%
And that was his point.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things he said was,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
that if he listed people
who were in the cult,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
everybody in Chicago would
recognize most of their names.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.070 align:middle line:90%
That alone was an eye-opener.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.260 align:middle line:84%
But here is the
line that he said

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
that made me realize he
was telling the truth,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that he wasn't just trying
to get attention for himself.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
He said, evil counts on
you not believing in it.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It counts on your arrogance.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.550 align:middle line:90%
It counts on it.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, he's
absolutely telling the truth.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
evil hides behind.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, Hitler knew that.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
Hitler knew that, absolutely.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.320 align:middle line:84%
When the Third Reich
plotted the Holocaust,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.300 align:middle line:84%
they absolutely knew that
one of the things about evil

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.270 align:middle line:84%
was that, if you were going
to pull off something evil,

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.568 align:middle line:90%
do it big--

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:90%
--because the bigger the easier.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And that's the nature of evil.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:84%
Because when it gets so
big, our mind shuts down.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And it goes the opposite
direction and says,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:90%
this can't be happening.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, it's not happening.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we do.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
We say, this can't be
happening, therefore, it's not.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything has its opposite.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%
Where there is darkness,
there is always light.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So where there is angels,
there is going to be demons.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, the forces
of the heavens

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.000 align:middle line:90%
are set up in polarities.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
nature of creation.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.830 align:middle line:84%
This has been reflected
in all sacred literature.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Dark spirits have
always been recognized

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.010 align:middle line:84%
through our written
traditions, sacred traditions.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
In Hinduism, in Buddhism, in
Native American traditions,

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
they will talk
about dark spirits.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
All the way in
the Old Testament,

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.740 align:middle line:84%
there were references
to angels and to demons.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And then that continued on in
Judeo-Christian literature.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetan literature
speaks of demons.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.720 align:middle line:84%
The presence of what
I would call demons

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
have been with us since
the beginning of time.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And I say this in a bit
of a way as a disclaimer,

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to
be speaking to you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
from my Catholic background
more on this topic

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:01.290 align:middle line:84%
than in any others, because
my background in theology

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
is particularly
highlighted here.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
My area is mysticism and
the mystical traditions.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And mysticism is
about the experience

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:90%
of the nature of God.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.530 align:middle line:84%
For example, Francis of
Assisi, perhaps the most famous

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Catholic Saint, or
Ignatius Loyola,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:90%
who started Loyola University--

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of the
literature of these Saints,

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.650 align:middle line:84%
which I'm sure you're
not familiar with,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:84%
make reference to
encounters with demons.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not something
you're familiar with, but I am.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
While they lived
hundreds of years ago,

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:84%
the only difference
between that time and now

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the territory
of the soul,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
both individually
and collectively,

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:90%
was less congested.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
And in that congestion, we've
become doubtful, arrogant.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And we are in the
business of reconstructing

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.650 align:middle line:84%
the nature of the
universe, not just studying

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:84%
it, but reconstructing what we
think the order of the universe

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, we're the
first human beings,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:84%
the first generation
to ever try that

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:90%
in the history of humanity?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to ask
you to ponder something.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:46.560 align:middle line:84%
What do you think is behind
that, light or darkness?

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:84%
I think studying, exploring
the nature of the universe

00:06:55.140 --> 00:07:00.520 align:middle line:84%
is something
resonating with light.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that
evil's greatest weapon

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:90%
is arrogance and deception.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's deception,
somehow or other,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that we're more intelligent
than evil, that we are--

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that we've become so
sophisticated that darkness

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.990 align:middle line:84%
can't come upon us, it
can't take hold of us,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that we know exactly
what darkness looks like.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is really one
of my favorite things,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're so educated
now, we're so technical,

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
we're so scientific that
evil can't somehow or other

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.740 align:middle line:90%
visit upon us.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:84%
When I was in graduate school,
I took a course on demonology.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.560 align:middle line:90%
And I took it as a lark.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:90%
My graduate work is in theology.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.480 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well, why not?

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And there was a movie
out at that time.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:90%
It was called "The Exorcist."

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.600 align:middle line:90%
It was very popular.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell
you something.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.470 align:middle line:90%
I'm not easily frightened.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not easily
influenced by that.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.410 align:middle line:84%
But that was the only
class in my life,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.260 align:middle line:84%
in the whole of my life
on this planet, where

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I stopped bringing the
books into my house.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, I left
the books outside.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the class,
I tossed them completely.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I was educated by an
extraordinarily brilliant

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.470 align:middle line:90%
professor, a Jesuit.

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:38.039 align:middle line:84%
And as he introduced
the subject of evil,

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:44.059 align:middle line:84%
he introduced it in the same
way I am introducing it to you.

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's with kind of a
little laugh and a little,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.670 align:middle line:84%
you think it doesn't
exist, because we

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:90%
thought we were so smart.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
So he asked us, what do
you think evil looks like?

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, after all, none of us
thinks of ourselves as evil,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:90%
absolutely none of us.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I rarely would look
and say to anyone that I love,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.990 align:middle line:90%
there is evil.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:90%
But what is evil?

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And he said, evil is
actually very clever.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.900 align:middle line:90%
It's very subtle.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's very invisible.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I say evil,
I want to be very clear

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:90%
what I am describing.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Evil and good are not
simply abstract concepts.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.050 align:middle line:84%
They are energies that you
can actually feel in your body

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.570 align:middle line:90%
or sense in your body and soul.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Each one of us is a magnet
that can attract dark or light.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:84%
This is how the law
of attraction works.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.930 align:middle line:84%
We are as capable
of acts of light

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.060 align:middle line:90%
as we are of acts of darkness.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And that truth is what
makes choices so powerful.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And all of us do negative and
positive things all the time.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
negative things and evil,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.750 align:middle line:84%
however, is that evil is
a conscious choice that

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.350 align:middle line:84%
requires you to actually
become a plotter.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.790 align:middle line:90%
It's deliberate.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
You are aware that your
actions will harm people.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And that truth
does not stop you.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.450 align:middle line:84%
The conscious act
to harm another

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.860 align:middle line:90%
is the fingerprint of evil.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the rich things
about mystical theology

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.520 align:middle line:84%
is that it teaches
about a world that

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
is about the experience
of the nature of God,

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of
the invisible world,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.680 align:middle line:84%
and the nature of how the
invisible world interacts

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking
about angels.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking about demons.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I've observed

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
because of the
background I come from,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
someone who is trained
in classical theology,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.320 align:middle line:84%
someone who is trained
in classical mysticism,

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I've watched as this
society has become

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
almost theatrical about angels,
for example, and very arrogant

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:90%
about darkness.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.590 align:middle line:84%
No, no, no, no,
darkness doesn't exist.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And what I've said to people,
well, what makes you think so?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I just don't
believe in it-- as if saying

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe in
it is enough to alter

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:48.660 align:middle line:84%
the cosmic design of this
universe, a design that

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
has been in place long
before we were on this planet

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and will be in place
long afterwards.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
The fact is we've become a
society that prefers the light,

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.190 align:middle line:84%
but wants nothing
to do with darkness.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, that alone is a worthy
discussion, isn't it?

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.380 align:middle line:84%
We put on crystals,
rocks, feathers.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'll say things like,
I'm avoiding negativity.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:25.010 align:middle line:84%
This Jesuit professor
said, darkness

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.800 align:middle line:84%
comes through a
back door, will come

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.750 align:middle line:84%
in through a subtle channel
in your life like this.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're a jealous
person for example,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.810 align:middle line:84%
darkness will help you to
rationalize your feelings.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:84%
You will deny feeling
jealous at all,

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.680 align:middle line:84%
though everyone
else will clearly

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.750 align:middle line:90%
see that emotion in you.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Rather, you'll make the
other person the villain,

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.730 align:middle line:84%
projecting all your negativity
onto that individual.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever been the
object of another person's

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.970 align:middle line:90%
envy, you know how this feels.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
You can actually sense the
power of those negative thought

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:90%
waves coming at you.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:84%
How you interpret it
all comes from what's

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.380 align:middle line:84%
going on inside of
you at that moment.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's going on inside
of you at that moment could

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.900 align:middle line:84%
be based on what you
ate, how you feel,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
the conversation you
had with your husband,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
or wife, or friend
in the morning.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all subjective.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
darkness plays its games.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:37.050 align:middle line:84%
It takes advantage
of that right there.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say you
get up in the morning.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of those
mornings where you--

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.250 align:middle line:84%
perhaps you're feeling
particularly vulnerable.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Let's just say you might
have a job interview,

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
or you're looking for something,
you're looking for a job.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
The nature of
darkness is to make

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:84%
you feel very bad
about yourself,

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:06.570 align:middle line:84%
is to make you feel the worst
about yourself, not the best.

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It's to make you feel like,
this isn't going to work,

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.680 align:middle line:90%
not that it is.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's follow that
through, because if you

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.880 align:middle line:84%
feel like it's
not going to work,

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.270 align:middle line:90%
what's your next natural step?

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Your next natural
step with darkness

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:31.160 align:middle line:84%
is that you will then seek out
a support system for darkness

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.570 align:middle line:90%
in yourself.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you will stay home.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you won't try so hard.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you'll pick up
that drink that you

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:90%
said you wouldn't drink again.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:90%
You will weaken yourself.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.970 align:middle line:84%
You will allow yourself
to make dark choices.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you will lie about
what you were doing that day.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you will find it OK
to just play with the truth

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more,
because that's

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:84%
what darkness does to chip
away at your character,

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:90%
your character.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It allows you little, by
little, by little to chip away

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:84%
at your integrity,
to chip away at what

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:90%
makes you a whole person.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.010 align:middle line:90%
That's how darkness works.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.340 align:middle line:84%
It's not this
gargoyle that shows up

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:31.310 align:middle line:84%
at the foot of your
bed, not at all.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.490 align:middle line:84%
But it shows up at the
foot of your psyche.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.950 align:middle line:84%
It shows up in the
way you see things.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:90%
And then it says--

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.950 align:middle line:90%
it starts influencing you.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And it says, you know what?

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:49.000 align:middle line:90%
It's OK to let someone down.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:84%
My point here is not to say
that any one person is evil,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
not at all, but to
point out the way evil

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:90%
works in our everyday lives.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And we need to understand
how evil works today

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.190 align:middle line:84%
more than ever,
because we've become

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.240 align:middle line:84%
accustomed to telling ourselves
that evil does not exist.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And that is exactly what
evil counts on, our denial.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And there is another
thing darkness does.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It's always there
to give you excuses

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
as to why it's OK not to be your
best, not to try your hardest.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.870 align:middle line:90%
It indulges your weakest links.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
It indulges, so that
instead of you trying hard,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.420 align:middle line:84%
it says, why don't
you do that tomorrow?

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Darkness always, always indulges
the procrastinator in you.

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.090 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't have to do that.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.830 align:middle line:90%
No, you don't have to.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And here is another
thing darkness does.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:17:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Darkness is absolutely
the best at helping

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
you to see the
worst in your life,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.240 align:middle line:84%
so that when you look
at something, instead

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.400 align:middle line:84%
of seeing a garden
full of flowers,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.680 align:middle line:90%
you will focus on the weeds.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
That, too, is a
product of darkness.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:84%
It permeates in these
small ways that are not

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.960 align:middle line:90%
small, not small at all.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is such
a huge topic, obviously,

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.100 align:middle line:84%
that if you left
me along with you,

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea where
this lecture would go.

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But I can't do it
that way, so I have

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
to squeeze it down to sound
bites, which, if you knew me,

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
you'd realize it's
driving me crazy,

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:48.250 align:middle line:84%
because I'm shrinking an archive
in my head to a postcard.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:51.140 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:90%
What is a collective arrogance?

00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:01.430 align:middle line:84%
I need you to travel with me,
travel with me to the cosmos.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
look down on the Earth

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.250 align:middle line:90%
and just visualize the Earth.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
imagine that you

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:12.310 align:middle line:84%
see Andromeda, and
the sombrero galaxies,

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and the whole big
universe out there,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
a universe so big with billions
and billions of galaxies.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Now imagine that Earth becomes
this small, this tiny, so tiny

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
that we don't even
show up anymore.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And from that
perspective, imagine

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
that we've decided we can
figure out how all of this

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.020 align:middle line:90%
was created, that we've got it.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:90%
We figured it out.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.600 align:middle line:84%
We figured that it just started
with a bang, a Big Bang,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.450 align:middle line:84%
that all of a sudden, the
whole universe went kaboom.

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's how life
started, yes, indeed.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.410 align:middle line:90%
We've decided.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
From our little point on
this tiny little planet,

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
we decided that the
whole universe--

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:84%
we don't even know
where it ends--

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that there was a bang
once upon a time.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So let me restructure, that
darkness count on arrogance.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
arrogance that says,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.520 align:middle line:84%
we can dump all this nuclear
waste into our oceans

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.720 align:middle line:90%
and we'll be just fine.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.240 align:middle line:84%
We can have all of these
great, big, huge glaciers melt,

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:84%
and will be just
fine, that we don't

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
have to regulate
our own negativity,

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:90%
because we'll be just fine.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:90%
So we deregulate ourself.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Does that word sound familiar?

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.870 align:middle line:90%
We deregulate.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
We deregulate our greed.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.070 align:middle line:84%
We deregulate our
cravings because we

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:90%
think we'll be just fine.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:84%
We stop thinking about
the next generation,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and the next
generation after that,

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't suit us.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.310 align:middle line:84%
That is the consequence
of darkness.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we decide,
there is no darkness,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.680 align:middle line:90%
which is its ultimate coup.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So someone would say,
what is our aversion

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.050 align:middle line:90%
to evil about that?

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't people more
naturally attracted to good?

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll tell you.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Evil is naturally
sexier than good.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.020 align:middle line:90%
And it always will be.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just more difficult for
good to compete with evil.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
When I think of a human being
being in league with darkness,

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.330 align:middle line:90%
this is how it happens.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Evil has a million answers
for every question,

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:90%
but goodness only has one.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.440 align:middle line:84%
I often compare evil
to a heroin addiction.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.080 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you start
shooting up, it's gotcha.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
It's an immediate
adrenaline rush.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:90%
It's physical, sensual.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
And it creates an altered state
of consciousness immediately.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.330 align:middle line:90%
You feel falsely empowered.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Evil makes you feel as if you've
found a route to power, as

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.720 align:middle line:84%
if you have a means
to control others,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:90%
but they can't control you.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.200 align:middle line:90%
And evil has secrets.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:90%
And don't we love our secrets?

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.090 align:middle line:90%
But nothing hides in the light.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that sense of
power over people with light.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Light doesn't build the
illusion that you have

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:90%
control of the outside world.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's evil's greatest hook.

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Acts of goodness don't seem
to have an immediate payday,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:84%
but darkness provides
immediate gratification.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's hard to resist.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.050 align:middle line:84%
So if I say, did
you move this paper,

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.480 align:middle line:90%
the answer is, yes or no.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you tell me the truth,
truth is an interesting force,

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:84%
because you have no control over
what I will do with the truth.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Once you tell the
truth, you have no idea

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.590 align:middle line:90%
what I will do with that.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Will the truth make
me angry or not?

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.300 align:middle line:10%
All you know is,
you told the truth.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Whereas evil, if you say, no,
and then you look at my face

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and you think, well,
maybe I did move it.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.780 align:middle line:90%
Evil has a million answers.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.250 align:middle line:90%
And you can keep going.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:90%
You can blame someone.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.180 align:middle line:90%
You can go left.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.097 align:middle line:84%
You can go-- you could
say you don't remember.

00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I don't recall.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.820 align:middle line:84%
There is a million answers
with evil, a million,

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.660 align:middle line:84%
but there is only
one with truth.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And if you decide,
I'm just not going

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:84%
to lie again, that changes the
whole direction of your life.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I've got a story about this.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.030 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing medical
intuitive readings,

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.620 align:middle line:90%
I did a reading on him.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, do
you want a laundromat?

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Because I see a
laundromat around you.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh, no, no,
I don't run no laundromat.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And he was laundering money
and running prostitution.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said, oh my god,
oh my god, that's it.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, I'm going
to give this up.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
do this anymore.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.090 align:middle line:90%
He said, that's it.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:09.985 align:middle line:90%
I'm changing my ways.

00:23:09.985 --> 00:23:10.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be good.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:11.850 align:middle line:90%
Right now, that's it.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm good, because he thought,
like, God was watching him,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
otherwise I couldn't
do this reading.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, he calls me up six
weeks later, and he says,

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.150 align:middle line:90%
I've got to tell you something.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
Turning honest
limits your choices.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
the reason why

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:84%
evil has the option over
good, because it gives someone

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.140 align:middle line:90%
a lot more choices.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.600 align:middle line:84%
So the journey of
consciousness is actually

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:49.380 align:middle line:84%
this journey of deciding, I
need to align myself with truth.

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I need to align
myself with truth

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and disarm the power
darkness has in me

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:90%
to hide in my own darkness.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And I have discovered with
people that that for them,

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:11.520 align:middle line:84%
for all of us, is a terrifying
choice to disarm darkness

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:90%
in ourselves.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.570 align:middle line:84%
When I was doing a
workshop with someone--

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.400 align:middle line:84%
not with someone,
in England one time,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and I got to the
subject of forgiveness,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.840 align:middle line:90%
this man said, that's it.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to hear anymore.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
He said, I don't want to
learn and truly understand

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.360 align:middle line:90%
that I have to be forgiving.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
I still need to be able to
get angry at them in order

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:44.460 align:middle line:84%
for me to still live
with these people.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.680 align:middle line:90%
I can't become more conscious.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:52.120 align:middle line:84%
I am deliberately
choosing anger, anger.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.863 align:middle line:84%
That was one of the
most insightful truths

00:24:56.863 --> 00:24:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that I have ever
heard anyone say.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And actually, he left
my workshop weeping.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
He was at that point where he
was very much aware that he

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:13.190 align:middle line:84%
was consciously choosing to
attack someone instead of just

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.980 align:middle line:90%
responding unconsciously.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.155 align:middle line:90%
And that qualifies as darkness.

00:25:18.155 --> 00:25:24.610 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about you directly.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And something to kind
of ask yourself, what

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.790 align:middle line:90%
is my own role with darkness?

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.780 align:middle line:90%
What is my role?

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And have you allowed yourself
to negotiate the truth?

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, everybody
has to answer yes

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:45.030 align:middle line:84%
to that, because somewhere
along the line, we all have.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.740 align:middle line:84%
But there comes a point,
you have to ask yourself,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
how consciously do I
negotiate the truth?

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:53.560 align:middle line:90%
How consciously?

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Do I get up in the morning
and know that I am likely

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.140 align:middle line:90%
going to tell a lie today?

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.630 align:middle line:84%
How likely is it that I
am going to say something

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.100 align:middle line:90%
to someone that's not true?

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know, in
my workshops, I

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:84%
have met so many people who hold
scar tissue because they feel

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.860 align:middle line:84%
like they've been
betrayed by someone,

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:20.760 align:middle line:84%
but they don't ever look
to themselves and how--

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and the ways in which
they have betrayed others.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The many, many times people have
said, I need to confide in you,

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I can't carry this
anymore in my heart,

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.800 align:middle line:84%
can I share some
of your heart space

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and confide in you, will
you keep this to yourself,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and someone has said, yes I
will, only to know for a fact

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:51.930 align:middle line:84%
they're going to tell
someone else in a second--

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.950 align:middle line:84%
they knew consciously that
they were giving their word

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.860 align:middle line:90%
and lying at the same time.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.020 align:middle line:90%
That qualifies for evil.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:84%
You may not define it
that way, but it is.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:84%
It is evil, because your
conscience alerted you

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:84%
that you were about to cross
a line in the sand, your sense

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.270 align:middle line:90%
of what is right and wrong.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.950 align:middle line:90%
And you crossed it anyway.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:20.940 align:middle line:84%
The negotiation of your
soul begins right there.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.290 align:middle line:84%
If you nurture dark choices,
it becomes a lifestyle.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And then you are an active
participant in the dark side.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.450 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I tell people
is that, we have to get over

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:43.710 align:middle line:84%
the idea that somehow
devotion to the lighter path

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:84%
is going to take the
edge off the more

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
physical, grounded
connection we have to life.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And that really is because
darkness has an edge.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.410 align:middle line:90%
There is a thrill to secrets.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:84%
There is a thrill
to secret societies.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.850 align:middle line:84%
There is a thrill
to this sense that,

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.840 align:middle line:90%
I know something you don't.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
history, and you

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
look at the way the
world is set up,

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.632 align:middle line:84%
light always cleans
up after darkness.

00:28:15.632 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:90%
We always have the war.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.670 align:middle line:90%
And then light comes in.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And it cleans up
afterwards, always.

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's
because we experience

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:28.830 align:middle line:84%
the power of the light
after we've gotten ourselves

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:90%
beaten to a bloody pulp.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.980 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.050 align:middle line:10%
But here is what's true.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:40.150 align:middle line:10%
We've reached the
point in our evolution

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:46.090 align:middle line:10%
where we really need
to utilize the power

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:10%
of the light in ourselves.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.690 align:middle line:84%
We actually need
to call that light

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.940 align:middle line:84%
in us, what I think of as
our nuclear power plant.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:84%
I consider turning
to our light to be

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
no longer an option,
but the greatest

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.300 align:middle line:90%
sacred necessity of our time.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.740 align:middle line:84%
All empires go
through transitions,

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.610 align:middle line:84%
but this time of
transition that we are in

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
is the greatest one in the
history of civilization.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And when you look through
the lens at the world,

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.900 align:middle line:84%
you could see the lens
through the battle

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:90%
of darkness and light.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.890 align:middle line:84%
You actually could,
because all things

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
have night and day,
light and dark to them.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:43.310 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, everything you
do is a choice between light

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:90%
and darkness, everything.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.820 align:middle line:84%
How you speak to someone,
how you interact,

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:84%
whether you choose
to be loving or not,

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.790 align:middle line:84%
whether you choose to be true
or not, whether you choose

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to be honest or not, you're
choosing light or darkness

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.110 align:middle line:90%
whether or not you realize it.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But now you're
going to realize it.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And here is something else.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Light has some
advantages, one of which

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
is, it takes very little
light in the darkness

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.660 align:middle line:90%
to make a difference.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Put one little dark spot
in a very light room,

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:90%
you'll likely miss it.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.800 align:middle line:90%
It won't make much difference.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But one candle in a huge, dark
auditorium, and you'll see it.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.000 align:middle line:90%
So a very little light--

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.610 align:middle line:90%
and that would be you--

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:43.900 align:middle line:84%
can change a whole
lot in this world.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.660 align:middle line:90%
So go for it.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Become all you can be.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:51.360 align:middle line:90%
Go for the light.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:90%
