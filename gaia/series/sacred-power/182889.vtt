00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And choice, it is
our great tool.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a
very different idea

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:90%
of what it means to be you.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.370 align:middle line:84%
We are creatures of energy,
residing in physical bodies.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And our power, our
energy-- your power--

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
is the substance that
fuels our bodies and lives.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And choice is the basic
expression of that power.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.000 align:middle line:84%
Choice-- probably something you
haven't given much thought to.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:10%
But our passion for personal
empowerment and self-esteem

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.960 align:middle line:10%
is deeply rooted in
our desire to develop

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.590 align:middle line:10%
a visceral connection to
the phenomenal power that's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:10%
contained in one active choice.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
Now what do I mean when
I say choice is power?

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.970 align:middle line:84%
After all, how
powerful can one choice

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
be in the whole
scheme of things?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you change the
direction of humanity,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
or the quality of your health,
or the quality of your life

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.570 align:middle line:90%
with just one choice?

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.550 align:middle line:90%
Are you that powerful?

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe you
are, and that you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
can change the direction of
your life with one choice.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.610 align:middle line:84%
That you are that
powerful of an instrument.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
We are living at the
greatest turning point

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.800 align:middle line:90%
in the history of civilization.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
privilege to be alive now.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a privilege.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.523 align:middle line:84%
And someday-- you know
that game people play,

00:01:55.523 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
and they'll often
ask, well if you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.372 align:middle line:84%
could live any other

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:00.330 align:middle line:90%
when would you live in?

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So many people
say, well, I would

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.350 align:middle line:84%
live during the
Egyptian era, and I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
want to see how the
pyramids were built.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.199 align:middle line:84%
Or they pick these
momentous eras in history.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:90%
But me, I would go forward.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:84%

That's what's happening
to us and within us.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.060 align:middle line:90%
We are creatures of energy now--

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
We've crossed the
fossil rubicon,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.270 align:middle line:90%
and entered into the solar age.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And that solar age is as much
in us as it is around us.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.740 align:middle line:90%
We are solarizing.

and S-O-U-L-A-R.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
And we are actually
living in two dimensions

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:90%
now, simultaneously--

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.390 align:middle line:84%
the realm of energy and
the realm of matter.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And while that has
always been true,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:84%
the difference in this
moment is that we're finally

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:84%
learning to navigate the
realm of energy and matter,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
largely because physicists
and scientists have

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:90%
gotten to the nuclear age.

It was one of his
great teachings.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And we are living
that truth now,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.150 align:middle line:84%
with greater and
greater immediacy.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I know when I was
growing up, we never

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
would think that something
that was going on in India,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:84%
or something going on in
Korea, or something going on

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
in Africa someplace could affect
us in Chicago or in California.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But today, if there is
a shift in something

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that happens in North Korea, or
in Russia, or in South America,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
it could affect
our bank accounts.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:10%
We could wake up with more money
or less money, just like that.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.100 align:middle line:84%
Because what we are learning is
the choice someone makes here

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:90%
affects everybody everywhere.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.930 align:middle line:90%
Because all change is universal.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.720 align:middle line:84%
What affects one part of the
system affects the whole.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.480 align:middle line:90%
And all change is immediate.

Everything you do affects
the whole of your family.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Same thing within your
community, what is in one

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:90%
is in the whole.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.520 align:middle line:84%
This goes for patriotism
and athletics.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So when our sports team
wins, it's our sports team.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.750 align:middle line:90%
They stand for all of us.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Now it's always been like that.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we didn't have
the means to understand

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.470 align:middle line:90%
that type of truth.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Part of it is because we still
live in the physical world,

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%

all the time.

And at the same time,
we are now living

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.320 align:middle line:84%
in the world of energy,
where we are just

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
beginning to learn that the
energetic choices we make

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.660 align:middle line:84%
may well be more powerful than
any of the physical choices we

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:90%
make.

An energetic choice
is responding

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.830 align:middle line:84%
to an energetic hunch

as you might call it.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.465 align:middle line:84%
So when presented with the
physical data of a business

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:84%
plan that looks
really good on paper,

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.050 align:middle line:84%
you're energetic response
is saying don't trust this.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And you choose to
go with your gut.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
Now realize the energetic
data is not presenting you

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
with a different plan,
but your intuition

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:84%
knows that calculations
are erroneous, and designed

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:84%
to disguise the small details
that your eyes can't see.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
So having enough faith
to forgo the obvious

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.660 align:middle line:84%
for what your energetic
sensory system is telling you

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
is essential for living
in balance and truth.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It was Jesus who said you
know a good mustard seed is

going to bring down a mountain.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make any sense
to someone who doesn't

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.648 align:middle line:90%
get the power of consciousness.

00:07:03.648 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Because they'll take
a little mustard seed,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
and they'll throw it at a
mountain, and they'll say,

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:90%
well that's preposterous.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.370 align:middle line:84%

about physical power.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.270 align:middle line:84%
He was talking about
the power of a thought.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:90%

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And you are always
being directed

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
to make choices that empower
you as a fundamental piece

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of guidance, that it is against
your nature to make a choice

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.300 align:middle line:90%
to disempower yourself.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
What we are living now is
this profound transition,

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
like an energetic Renaissance,
where we are actually

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
witnessing the teachings of
Buddha, the teachings of Jesus,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:22.070 align:middle line:84%
these teachings of these great
cosmic masters manifesting

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
actually in technology,
where the internet is

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.190 align:middle line:90%
a duplicate of the internet--

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:84%
the way we are
connected to each other.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And that we need to
acknowledge that there's

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as an
insignificant choice.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And by virtue of that,
every choice you make

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.990 align:middle line:90%
needs to be considered profound.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
That every choice is
an act of creation.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And that we need to have
a very different power

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:90%
strategy with ourselves.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do is a
calculated power move.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
You strategize about
what you should

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
wear, what car you should
drive, who you should

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.380 align:middle line:90%
marry-- about everything.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
We are drawn to power
things and objects

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.140 align:middle line:84%
that represent or
symbolize what we think

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:84%
is power, like big cars, or
bling, or designer clothing.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And while it's wonderful to
enjoy the bounty of life,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.830 align:middle line:84%
esteeming yourself is not based
upon the acquisition of goods,

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.470 align:middle line:84%
but on your capacity
to protect and honor

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:84%
who you are, regardless of what
you own, or where you live,

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.070 align:middle line:90%
or the occupation you have.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
The journey of
life is about, how

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.980 align:middle line:84%
am I going to invest the
power of my life force?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.900 align:middle line:84%
In what ways can my life
enhance the lives of others?

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, we answer that
question hundreds of times

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
a day with every
decision we make.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:10%
There is nothing
small about you.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Every choice either empowers
you or disempowers you.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:17.000 align:middle line:84%
The choice to be in a
situation and think,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.620 align:middle line:90%
is this a crisis or not?

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Is this a crisis or not?

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Does it matter how I
respond in this moment?

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no?

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.360 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course it matters,
every choice matters.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
If you tell a
white lie about why

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.430 align:middle line:84%
you were late to work or bend
the truth about certain facts

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.490 align:middle line:84%
and details that are important
for other people to know,

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:84%
you need to realize that
these seemingly insignificant

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.910 align:middle line:84%
negative choices
add up, and directly

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.730 align:middle line:84%
affect your energetic
anatomy and eventually,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.532 align:middle line:90%
your entire well-being.

00:12:50.532 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So how do you discern
the difference

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.770 align:middle line:84%
between what empowers you and
what does not empower you?

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
First, I'm going to share with
you eight of the most important

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.590 align:middle line:90%
power choices you can make.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to move these
through your biology

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:84%
so that you have a biophysical
spiritual reference

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.710 align:middle line:90%
point within you.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:32.460 align:middle line:84%
So that you have this sense
of breathing, feeling a choice

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.870 align:middle line:84%
as it moves through
your bio spiritual self.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.800 align:middle line:84%
A bio spiritual
reference point is

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.320 align:middle line:84%
when you fully
understand that you live

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.240 align:middle line:90%
and breathe with all life.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:84%
That the laws that balance
nature also balance you.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So if you're thrown off
balance, your whole planet

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.980 align:middle line:84%
is off balance because
your body is your planet.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And everything
about your life gets

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.540 align:middle line:84%
to work on bringing you
back to balance immediately.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:05.350 align:middle line:84%
For example, you may be
overtired, and need to rest.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't pay
attention to the signals

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
from your body telling
you to take a break,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
you might get a migraine
that forces you to rest.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So making the choice to
listen to your energetic data

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.980 align:middle line:84%
is a choice in harmony
with the law of balance.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So that you know the
moment you make a choice,

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.310 align:middle line:90%
the power goes through you.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And a choice either empowers you
or it's going to take from you.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.060 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Just by design-- just
because I know human beings--

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
you're going to look
to the outside world

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to think
that I'm talking about choices

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.020 align:middle line:90%
that are out there--

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:48.300 align:middle line:90%
great, big, huge.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:10%
Like the choice to buy
a car, or get a house,

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.070 align:middle line:10%
or move an elephant,
and I'm not.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.770 align:middle line:84%
All the choices I'm talking
about no one can see but you.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:84%
They all take place in the
world behind your eye--

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:90%
every one of them.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Everything else is the
caboose on your train.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about the engine.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.197 align:middle line:90%
This is the engine of your life.

00:15:12.197 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Here are the eight most
important power choices

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.790 align:middle line:90%
you can make.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.850 align:middle line:84%
To not betray
yourself or others.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
To live with
integrity and truth.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:90%
To know and live your values.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.080 align:middle line:84%
The choice to have a spiritual
worldview or practice.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:84%
To practice kindness
in your life.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
To be reflective of
your personal actions.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:10%
To be of service to others.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:10%
And the choice to empower
others in your life.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.000 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about each
of these just a bit more,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:10%
let's begin with to not
betray yourself or others.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.150 align:middle line:90%
Now that is great, big, huge--

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.170 align:middle line:90%
great, big, huge.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
Because it means that I will
respond to my inner guidance.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.900 align:middle line:84%
That I will live in--
here's the operative word--

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.820 align:middle line:90%
congruently.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.790 align:middle line:84%
My head and my heart
will speak to each other.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.910 align:middle line:90%
Betrayal is a big deal.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.100 align:middle line:90%
Betrayal's a big deal.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
Now what does it mean to say
to thine own self be true?

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.280 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the most difficult
paths in life to lead--

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.890 align:middle line:90%
to be true to yourself.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We start out in baby
steps because we think

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%
it means to do what we want.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:37.020 align:middle line:84%
But it actually goes
much more to the core

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
of becoming an integris
person, of really beginning

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.520 align:middle line:90%
the journey of self-knowledge.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.940 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, you
make the decision

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to tell the truth, no matter
what, and then comes the test.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You are asked a direct
question, do you

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.970 align:middle line:90%
support what our boss is doing?

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps your
partner asks you,

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.220 align:middle line:84%
are you really happy
in our relationship?

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.079 align:middle line:90%
And now what do you do?

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:09.740 align:middle line:84%
You cannot anesthetized a
commitment to the truth.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
Once you have set yourself on
a course of becoming congruent,

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.170 align:middle line:84%
you'll have to be
prepared for your world

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.810 align:middle line:90%
to shift because it will.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Be honest about what
really motivates me.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Who I am.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.520 align:middle line:84%
What makes me do the
things that I do.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Like, who's really responsible
for what's going on here?

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.500 align:middle line:10%
And I'll give you
an example of that.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:10%
When I was writing
"Invisible Acts of Power"

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:47.980 align:middle line:10%
this one woman said
that she made the choice

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.060 align:middle line:10%
not to follow her guidance
in this one instance.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.750 align:middle line:84%
She was a model, she was
working at a modeling agency.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And this young model, meaning
someone, like, two years

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:84%
or three years younger than
her was new to the set,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
came up to her and
said, do I look OK?

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
this girl was beautiful.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.500 align:middle line:90%
She was stunning.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.170 align:middle line:90%
She looked gorgeous.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:90%
And I knew it.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.030 align:middle line:84%
She said, my gut instinct
knew she was fragile,

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
she just needed a
little self-esteem.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.050 align:middle line:84%
And she said and I felt that
guidance coming into me.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.050 align:middle line:90%
I felt it, I knew it.

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And she said instead,
I looked at her

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and I deliberately made
the choice to hurt her.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And I looked and I said
you're OK, you're OK.

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:43.070 align:middle line:84%
She said I saw the life
drain out of her face.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:46.340 align:middle line:84%
She said, I've never
forgiven myself.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I'll never not see her face.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.625 align:middle line:84%

If you've made the choice to
have a spiritual worldview,

We are spilling into the
truth of oneness backwards

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.170 align:middle line:90%
by-- for example--

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.170 align:middle line:84%
dumping our medications
down the toilet,

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and thoughtlessly
polluting the whole ocean.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.690 align:middle line:84%
It is only through
our mistakes that we

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.060 align:middle line:90%
discover that we are all one.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.330 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we cannot bear
to enter into that discovery

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.920 align:middle line:90%
consciously.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.150 align:middle line:84%

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Make the choice to

you have no idea how
powerful that is.

That, in fact, a smile

kept a homeless person

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
But we often diminish the
power contained in small acts

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.410 align:middle line:84%
of kindness, perhaps because we
cannot imagine their long-term

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:90%
consequences.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.590 align:middle line:84%
We imagine that
assistance in life

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
should be big, dramatic,
financial, and immediate.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
But the hidden
resource of grace that

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.480 align:middle line:84%
resides like a small jewel
within every act of kindness

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.750 align:middle line:84%

person's lifetime.

beyond this moment in time.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.910 align:middle line:84%
But this truth is a

to absorb and appreciate
because we are so

As a result of the history
we have with the kind of God

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.150 align:middle line:90%
we have--

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.640 align:middle line:84%
got to be careful with
this, but this is my point--

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.430 align:middle line:84%
we've created a God of
productivity in the West.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.860 align:middle line:84%
We've created a God
of practicality.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:84%
The kind of God we like is the
one that when we say a prayer,

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:37.850 align:middle line:84%
that prayer is answered
practically, and effectively,

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and that it includes
a reason for why

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:47.000 align:middle line:90%
we should do what we do.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.160 align:middle line:84%
So when someone has asked me, do
you have any prayers that work?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I need some practical
results when

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.650 align:middle line:84%
I pray because I need to
see what's my highest good,

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:90%
and what's my highest purpose.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And it better be practical, and
it better have a pension plan,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.340 align:middle line:90%
and it better make money.

00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I have got
no use for this God.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
If I had to that person, well,
I got some guidance for you,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that the purpose of your
life is to learn kindness.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And I have it here
directly from God,

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.010 align:middle line:84%
that that's the
purpose of your life.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Most people would
be so disappointed

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.900 align:middle line:90%
that that was their purpose.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
They would be so disappointed.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.567 align:middle line:84%
They would sit
down and say you go

00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and you ask again, because
this is just not good enough.

time aside each day

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.640 align:middle line:84%
to think clearly and deeply
about the quality of choices

you make in your life,

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.300 align:middle line:84%
the long-term consequences

lived by that truth,

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:84%
that every choice
affects the whole

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, I must account
to all life from my choices.

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:57.590 align:middle line:84%
Though that is an
unrealistic goal,

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.560 align:middle line:84%
still the practice
of reflection helps

us to realize that what
we do and think matters.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%

must hold ourselves

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.030 align:middle line:84%
accountable for the quality
of choices we make in life.

But eventually, the kinds
of choices that we make

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:23.140 align:middle line:84%
are not about becoming seen
in order to be powerful,

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:84%
but becoming reflective,
becoming congruent, becoming

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:90%
of service.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:35.090 align:middle line:84%

powerful enough in me,

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.730 align:middle line:90%
that I can empower others.

empower someone in their life.

It's because they
couldn't love someone

as deeply as they
wanted to love them.

more time with their loved ones

themselves the chance

that the values motivating them

were worthless or artificial.
