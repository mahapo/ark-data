00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.545 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people will
say I'm in a dark night,

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.170 align:middle line:84%
and they have no idea
they're referring

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.820 align:middle line:90%
to a mystical journey.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But the dark night of
the soul is, in fact,

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.240 align:middle line:90%
a archetypal, mystical journey.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It was outlined in
the 16th century

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.610 align:middle line:84%
by a Spanish Carmelite priest
named John of the Cross.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:90%

>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So John of the Cross
described his mystical odyssey

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.920 align:middle line:84%
as he lay in a dark and putrid
cell sometime around the year

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:90%
1577.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Ordained a Carmelite
priest in 1567,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.600 align:middle line:84%
Juan de Yepes y
Alvarez vowed himself

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.440 align:middle line:84%
to the strict rule
of the Carmelites.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.725 align:middle line:10%
Distraught over what he and
his spiritual companion Saint

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:29.130 align:middle line:10%
Teresa of Avila felt
was the contamination

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:10%
of their divine order of the
Carmelites, the two of them

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:10%
set off under what they
felt was divine instruction

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.900 align:middle line:10%
for the reformation
of the Carmelites.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.240 align:middle line:84%
This led to his
imprisonment and torture

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
in this damp and dirty
narrow cell with only God

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:90%
as his companion.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, you might think a
priest would feel justified

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and comforted knowing
he was doing God's work

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.280 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the circumstances
brought, but he did not.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:90%
He was a very little man.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.640 align:middle line:90%
He was very cold.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
He was bleeding, he was
battered, and he was all alone.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
And Juan de la Cruz felt
humiliated and confused.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.040 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
perhaps so many of us

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.930 align:middle line:84%
would relate to
John of the Cross.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
When we feel like
we've been guided

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and things seem to
go bad, we wonder,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.370 align:middle line:84%
why has God forsaken us,
and that's what he wondered.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.580 align:middle line:84%
His suffering was intense,
and he found himself

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.880 align:middle line:84%
deep in that first stage
of his spiritual journey

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:84%
that he came to
call the dark night

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:84%
of the soul and the first
stage that he identified

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.520 align:middle line:90%
as the night of the senses.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, John of the
Cross was not somebody

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
who I would think was very
popular with so many people.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But his journey has
become so well known.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
What I hear from people all the
time is, I'm in a dark night,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:84%
this is a dark night, but they
have no idea that that phrase,

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.890 align:middle line:84%
that that inner experience
that they're describing,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
in fact, originated
with a Spanish priest

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
from the 16th century, that, in
fact, what they're describing

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.755 align:middle line:90%
is a profound mystical journey.

00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to hit a pause
button here, which is my habit,

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
and give you a bit of
a larger perspective

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
before we jump back
in and I describe

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.820 align:middle line:84%
in detail the dark
night of the soul

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
because I'll bet you
that some part of you

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:90%
relates to this intimately.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Quite a few years ago,
I observed something.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
As all of you know, one of
the epidemics of our time

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is depression, is
inner suffering.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.950 align:middle line:10%
There's never been a time
in human society like now

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.770 align:middle line:10%
where there has been
so much suffering

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.870 align:middle line:10%
in the world behind our eye
as much as the world in front

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:10%
of our eye, that we now are
in so much medical support,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:10%
therapeutic support
for our inner space

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.660 align:middle line:10%
as much as for our outer space.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.565 align:middle line:84%
We are becoming very
psychically porous.

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:52.390 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And so much of the depression
we see now in our society

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
is what I call a
spiritual crisis, not

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.620 align:middle line:84%
a psychological
one, not one that we

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:84%
need to medicate in the
hope of eradicating it

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:90%
from our personal world.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Rather, a spiritual crisis
is a profound journey

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:84%
of transformation that
we need to embrace

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.700 align:middle line:84%
regardless of the
suffering it may cause us.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, I recognize
spiritual crises,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.430 align:middle line:84%
but that's not language
that a lot of people use.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It's what falls under the
title of holy language for me.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm not accustomed
to people saying,

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a spiritual crisis.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, in the
near future, that

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.120 align:middle line:84%
will be something people
recognize, but it's not.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And so several years
ago, I recognized

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
that this is true, that, in
fact, the mystical experiences

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that these great
mystics wrote about

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
had adapted to modern times,
that the dark night of the soul

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.935 align:middle line:84%
had adapted itself to who
we are, to our modern times.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:16.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.720 align:middle line:84%
We, however, don't
speak mysticism.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't recognize
a mystical crisis.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't recognize
a spiritual crisis.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.660 align:middle line:90%
We don't call it that.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
So our tendency is to
go to a therapist, is

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to think that something is
wrong, unaware that, in fact,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:84%
what's happening is really a
deep and profound spiritual

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:84%
crisis or a spiritual
transformation.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:10%
Now, archetypally
speaking, the difference

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:10%
between a spiritual crisis
and a psychological one,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.200 align:middle line:10%
first of all, in general--

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.600 align:middle line:10%
let me just say, before I take
you deep into the dark night

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:10%
because it's fair for you to
say, as I always say to people,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.460 align:middle line:10%
if you were sitting with me now,
a logical question would be,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.140 align:middle line:10%
why do I need to
know about this?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Because spiritual crises
are now happening, as far as

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm concerned, more
than psychological ones.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
They look the same.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.570 align:middle line:90%
They often present the same.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But a spiritual crisis has a
very different agenda with you.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.940 align:middle line:90%
It has, in fact, an agenda.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.640 align:middle line:90%
It is a conscious crisis.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Can you imagine?

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%
But it is.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:53.320 align:middle line:84%
A spiritual crisis is conscious,
whereas a psychological crisis

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:90%
is not.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.880 align:middle line:84%
But a spiritual
crisis of the soul

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.730 align:middle line:84%
has purpose and intent, as I'll
describe to you when I'll take

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:90%
it apart as the dark night.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the thing is they
present the same way.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.765 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
depression is there.

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:19.785 align:middle line:90%
The sense of despair is there.

00:08:19.785 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
The sense of confusion,
anxiety, all of that

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
can present in your
life the exact same way.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
The difference between
a psychological

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:42.539 align:middle line:84%
and a spiritual crisis is
that the spiritual crisis

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.890 align:middle line:84%
has almost like this
little jewel of grace

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:53.730 align:middle line:84%
inside that indicates there's
a reason for this suffering.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:90%
It's not without meaning.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not without meaning.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to take you into
the dark night of the soul,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and I want to describe it
to you as John of the Cross

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
talked about it because
it's, I believe,

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.320 align:middle line:84%
so important for the
contemporary person

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.390 align:middle line:90%
to understand this.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:23.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a crisis that
has emerged or erupted

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:84%
into modernity because
we are confronting

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
a new template of
what's possible

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and what is impossible, what
we think the nature of God is.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.660 align:middle line:90%
So let me take you in.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, many times people have
said to me, I'm in a dark night,

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and they'll describe that they
are going through a divorce

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
or they're having an
emotionally difficult

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.890 align:middle line:90%
time in a relationship or--

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.248 align:middle line:84%
does that qualify
as a dark night?

00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
say, no, it doesn't.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:90%


00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
A dark night of the soul is
an entire archetypal journey,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and it has an agenda,
and it has a path.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose of the dark
night is to break you down

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
and then to change
the relationship you

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:30.450 align:middle line:84%
have with your understanding
of how the divine works

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:84%
in your life, how the nature
of the invisible world

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.200 align:middle line:90%
works in your life specifically.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
your background is.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
your tradition is.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter because
this is archetypal.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Every single person starts
out with their relationship

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.580 align:middle line:84%
with the non-physical
world, with this idea

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
that there is a way to reason
with the non-physical world,

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.650 align:middle line:84%
and that there are logical
reasons for why things happen

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
as they do, that there is a way
that we can behave that we can

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
form a kind of
parent-child relationship

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:22.380 align:middle line:84%
with God in such a way
that if we are good,

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.150 align:middle line:84%
bad things won't happen to
us, and that if we receive

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
guidance, that somehow, if
we follow that guidance,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that we will be
protected from bad things

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.450 align:middle line:90%
or rewarded if we struggle.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I have had conversations
with people

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
who have been in accidents,
and they've gotten out

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
of these accidents, and
they've made remarks like,

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.810 align:middle line:84%
honestly, I must be
something special,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I must have been saved
for a special reason,

00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.270 align:middle line:84%
or I was meant to do something
special because this bad thing

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
happened, as if specialness
is the counter-product

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
to difficulty or that
the sign that you've

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:84%
made the right decision
in your guidance

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be that
everything went smoothly.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I know it was the right decision
because right after I did that,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:29.480 align:middle line:84%
boy, everything went easily as
if, should it not go easily,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
then you want to sit back
and say, well, excuse me,

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
but I did everything just
like you guided me to,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.120 align:middle line:90%
so explain yourself.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's how
human beings reason.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:84%
So the first night,
the first stage

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.970 align:middle line:84%
of the dark night of the
soul, the night of the senses

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
is a confrontation
with exactly that kind

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
of reason, which is why going
back to the beginning of this,

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:03.170 align:middle line:84%
John of the Cross felt that
he was following guidance when

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.990 align:middle line:84%
he was working with
Teresa of Avila

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to challenge the
Carmelite community.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
None of that makes
any difference to you.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:84%
The only part that
matters is that he

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.750 align:middle line:84%
felt like we often feel, that
we are following guidance.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:90%
And it seemed to backfire.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Now, apply this to your life,
how many times you might follow

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:33.530 align:middle line:10%
what you believe is guidance
or how many times you feel

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:10%
like you've followed your
inner instruction only to feel

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.540 align:middle line:10%
like this is very difficult, I
must have done something wrong,

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:10%
because the way you look
for validation as to whether

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:10%
or not you've done the right
thing is because you expect--

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:10%
and here's the operative word--

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:06.940 align:middle line:10%
you expect things to be easy as
a result. You expect fairness--

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:10%
word number two.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:84%
You expect justice--
word number three.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.280 align:middle line:84%
You expect heaven to somehow
have the wind at your back

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.290 align:middle line:84%
because you've
followed guidance.

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.630 align:middle line:84%
This is the way a
child sees heaven.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.940 align:middle line:84%
And what John
suddenly realized was

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:84%
that at the first level
of the dark night,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.240 align:middle line:84%
as he was being beaten
by his Carmelites.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.480 align:middle line:84%
His first response was, how
could this happen to me?

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I've only done something
good, and this is not working.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:90%
And it tests our metal.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And he realized, as in
the center of this abuse,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that he had a choice, that he
could become very resentful

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.450 align:middle line:84%
or he could change how he
understood the nature of God.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:84%
He must have had a very immature
idea of God that, in fact,

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:14.250 align:middle line:84%
the idea of God was based
on making everything

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.280 align:middle line:84%
go right for him
in the world, which

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.040 align:middle line:90%
it so often is for people.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Unless everything is reasonable,
unless everything is fair,

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
then there is no
such thing as God.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:90%
There is no such thing as God.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:90%
It's just a man-made thing.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And on that night during
those experiences,

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.800 align:middle line:84%
during that experience of abuse,
what he realized at a deeper

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.020 align:middle line:84%
level-- and I hope I
can communicate this--

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:48.940 align:middle line:84%
is that the deeper choice was
life is not about fairness

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
but how we respond in
the midst of unfairness.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Life is not about reason but how
we navigate the unreasonable.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The journey of our
soul is how cleverly

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
we maneuver through
the unreasonable.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
How is it possible
that we can choose

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to be loving in the
midst of cruelty,

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:27.340 align:middle line:84%
to be forgiving in
the midst of insanity?

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And somehow he realized that
that was the great choice

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.430 align:middle line:90%
of the divine being.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote, "On that
glad night, in secret--"

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.540 align:middle line:90%
>> "--when no one saw me--"

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:16:48.640 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.490 align:middle line:10%
>> "--deep in the place
where only we could be."

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:14.109 align:middle line:90%


00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:90%
John of the Cross chose love.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
He confronted his
reasonable self

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:24.619 align:middle line:84%
and gave up his ego
demands, and he realized,

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to choose love
in the midst of insanity,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:90%
in the midst of cruelty.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
I will, quote, "turn
the other cheek,"

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:39.790 align:middle line:84%
not because I'm ordered to,
but because it's the only thing

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.770 align:middle line:90%
that makes sense.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And what doesn't make sense
will make sense out of this--

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:90%
the mystical paradox.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
In that instant,
grace stepped in,

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.770 align:middle line:90%
and his conflict was resolved.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.960 align:middle line:84%
He no longer felt God
had abandoned him,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and the second phase of the
dark night of the soul began.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The night of the spirit
is the second phase

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.520 align:middle line:90%
of the dark night of the soul.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:10%
During the night
of the senses, we

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.050 align:middle line:10%
confront the breakdown
of the myths of the God

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:10%
we want, the God of personal
justice and favoritism,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:10%
when we finally accept
that God did not

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.910 align:middle line:10%
create this world for us
but us for this world.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.700 align:middle line:84%
Then we go from our
breakdown to our breakthrough

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:29.090 align:middle line:90%
in the night of the senses.

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.940 align:middle line:84%
It is during this deep
mystical unfolding

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that we discover how we have
limited our capacity to love,

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
how we have withheld
compassion, how and why we

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.180 align:middle line:90%
have judged others.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.080 align:middle line:84%
During this remarkable journey,
those scales fall off our eyes,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.700 align:middle line:84%
and what is left is only
our openness to love.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.610 align:middle line:84%
John of the Cross's deep
experience of mystical love

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.280 align:middle line:90%
was initiated in prison.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:84%
He eventually escaped with
the help of a fellow Carmelite

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and was canonized Saint
John of the Cross in 1726.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.710 align:middle line:10%
A beautiful example
in our modern times

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:10.970 align:middle line:10%
of a person responding from
this deep place of mystical love

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:10%
after a devastating
event in their life

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.220 align:middle line:10%
comes from the Dalai Lama.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:10%
When a reporter said
to the Dalai Lama

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:10%
after this slaughter of
one third of the monks

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:10%
in Tibet, what do
you think about this,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:10%
he was hoping to provoke
from the Dalai Lama.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:35.360 align:middle line:84%
But he said, I think
compassion, compassion.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama was coming
from the night of the spirit,

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:90%
the second stage.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, you hold onto me here.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:52.580 align:middle line:90%


00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We need the dark
night of the soul.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:84%
What we need is
that we desperately

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:04.010 align:middle line:84%
need the experience of
cosmic disappointment.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We absolutely need to confront
why we so desperately want life

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to be reasonable and
fair, to want life

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:20.100 align:middle line:84%
to be what it can
never, ever, ever be

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.200 align:middle line:84%
and why we keep insisting
that life is like that.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:10%
We must confront in us why
we become so angry at people

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.710 align:middle line:10%
who we feel let us down.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:10%
When they do something, we
think, you're so unfair,

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:10%
this is so not right, that we
cannot get over that things

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.230 align:middle line:10%
that just--

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.330 align:middle line:10%
that should not happen
to us because we

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:10%
think we're so special, that
unfair things that we think,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:10%
it's OK if they happen to
others, but not to us, by God,

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:10%
not to us.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:59.270 align:middle line:84%
We need to have that part
of ourselves confronted.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Because at the root
of it is this reason--

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:08.540 align:middle line:84%
we are terrified to
love without boundaries,

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:84%
to really love deeply, to
love without restrictions.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:84%
We are terrified to actually
hear guidance in us that

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:24.470 align:middle line:84%
instructs us to care for
those that our mind would say,

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:84%
stay away from those
people, but our heart

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.530 align:middle line:90%
would say, go to them.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:36.080 align:middle line:84%
We are terrified of the
depth of our own humanity.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.090 align:middle line:84%
We're actually
terrified of that.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And it is only our
need for reason

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that allows us to control the
size and depth of our humanity.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
It's only our
capacity to stay angry

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:84%
at life that allows us
to control how much we'll

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:84%
allow ourself to love,
and that, in fact,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:84%
if we became mystically,
unreasonably, unreasonable,

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:84%
wildly open to
the power of love,

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:17.150 align:middle line:84%
we would not be able to control
our response to strangers.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.430 align:middle line:90%
We would feel them.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.820 align:middle line:84%
We would no longer
be inclined to judge.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.180 align:middle line:84%
We would no longer be inclined
to put up the boundaries that

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:90%
so easily come up in us.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's so funny.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Just as we're entering the
age of the global community,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
we're entering the age of the
global dark night of the soul.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sure if you
were sitting with me,

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.050 align:middle line:90%
you would say, what do I do?

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.830 align:middle line:84%
How do I know if
I'm in a dark night?

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:90%
How do I know?

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
What do I do when it strikes?

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.270 align:middle line:90%
What if it comes upon me?

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
It could strike at the
happiest day of my life.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it could.

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily triggered
by a divorce or a bad day.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:84%
The dark night can strike
you as sure as you are just

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.530 align:middle line:84%
walking down the street on
the loveliest day of the year

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
because it is an archetypal
spiritual transformation,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and it hits when the
time is right for you

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
to begin this journey, for
you to begin this journey.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And so my counsel to
you, my counsel to you,

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is that the symptoms of
the dark night are these--

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.570 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you have to sit down
deeply with yourself

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself first, is
this a psychological crisis,

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.450 align:middle line:90%
or am I in a spiritual one?

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.080 align:middle line:90%
Am I in a battle with God?

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And in my heart, I am
terrified of my own survival,

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and that terrifies
me spiritually.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And you ask yourself
that question.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.960 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself deeply
if, at the root,

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.530 align:middle line:84%
you feel like life
is not following

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:12.250 align:middle line:84%
my logical conclusions,
my logical order,

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:20.620 align:middle line:84%
that I am, in fact, terrified
that the choices I make

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:90%
don't play out.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And I need to change
me in order to proceed.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.730 align:middle line:90%
I can't change anything else.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.720 align:middle line:90%
It's me that has to change.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And the parts of me that
have to change are so deep.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
changing an attitude.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about changing a
relationship with how I

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.110 align:middle line:90%
fundamentally see the universe.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:84%
That is where you begin with
looking at the dark night.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And as you proceed with
that, turn your attention

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:10.330 align:middle line:84%
to grace, because
in the dark night,

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.120 align:middle line:84%
as you proceed to the
second stage, which

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
is the night of your spirit,
and you think, is this worth it,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:24.000 align:middle line:84%
what you learn, what you
discover about yourself

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.620 align:middle line:84%
is that you have hidden in
you an extraordinary capacity

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.080 align:middle line:84%
to transform the lives
of other people--

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:39.060 align:middle line:84%
not influence them,
transform them.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
Transform means
to inspire people

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:45.615 align:middle line:90%
to become better human beings.

00:25:45.615 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.060 align:middle line:90%
Influence means control.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
Inspire comes from grace.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:03.710 align:middle line:84%
You have an enormous capacity
to use the graces inside of you

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.480 align:middle line:90%
to become a channel for grace.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the power of
your spirit, and that's

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
what I call becoming
spiritually, mystically

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:22.290 align:middle line:84%
unreasonable to do things that
only makes sense to your soul.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens when you
let love go and run through you

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:90%
like the force it's meant to.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me add something
about the dark night that's

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.550 align:middle line:90%
really important to understand.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It is both a personal journey
and an impersonal journey.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
It is about you understanding or
recognizing or being introduced

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.460 align:middle line:90%
to your sacred design.

00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Shall I say the secret power,
a hidden resource in you?

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We don't get to that part of
ourselves without a struggle.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.170 align:middle line:90%
We just don't.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:12.090 align:middle line:84%
All the treasures of life
are never easily accessed,

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.860 align:middle line:90%
and that's just the way it is.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:21.160 align:middle line:84%
It's worth the dark night
to let yourself become

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.420 align:middle line:90%
a mystic without a monastery.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.020 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:84%
The dark night is a fight
to the finish, a bending

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.950 align:middle line:90%
until there is a breakthrough.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And like the addict that
is broken and retrieved

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
through treatment, brighter
days, I promise you,

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.300 align:middle line:84%
are in the end for the travelers
through the dark night.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And all the while, your
spirit speaks to you,

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:84%
believe me, even through
the most difficult of times.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.340 align:middle line:90%
