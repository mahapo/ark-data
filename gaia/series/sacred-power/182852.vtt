[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I think self-esteem
is misunderstood.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it has been
defined in so many ways

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.130 align:middle line:84%
as the capacity to
speak up in terms

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.070 align:middle line:90%
of your personal boundaries.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's the rehearsal
for self-esteem.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:84%
To esteem the self
means to recognize

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:90%
what the power of your soul is.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Carolyn
Myss, and I started

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:10%
giving medical intuitive
readings in 1983.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.910 align:middle line:10%
So I've been teaching
and traveling

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.520 align:middle line:10%
the globe for a long time.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.550 align:middle line:10%
For all of the years that I
have taught about intuition,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.900 align:middle line:10%
and I've seen people do
all kinds of exercises

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of
meditation tactics,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:10%
the truth is, the key
to your self-esteem

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:10%
is that intuitive clarity
and trust of oneself

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:10%
are the core ingredients.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:84%
The quality of self-esteem
that I'm talking about

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.630 align:middle line:90%
sustains your health.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's not showy or public.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.740 align:middle line:90%
It's not loud.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't inspire you
to reach for attention.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.710 align:middle line:10%
In fact, healthy
self-esteem liberates you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.250 align:middle line:10%
from that need to seek
other people's approval.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Healthy self-esteem
helps you to break

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.400 align:middle line:84%
from that fear of being
humiliated, that you can rely

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.430 align:middle line:84%
on your own integrity
and values to remain

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.660 align:middle line:84%
unshakable no matter the
circumstances that you're in.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if you cannot trust
yourself, you'll discover,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:84%
as I'm sure many of
you already have,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.039 align:middle line:84%
that trusting anybody else, or
anything, is nearly impossible.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem is core to your
progressing and creating

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
truly healthy
relationships, not just with

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.790 align:middle line:84%
your friends and your family
and your personal partners,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.300 align:middle line:90%
but with yourself.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are meant to
develop self-esteem.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But I need to position it in
such a huge tapestry for you

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that you get that
self-esteem is not an option.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a necessity.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a necessity because
of who we are today

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.050 align:middle line:84%
and how different we are
from previous generations.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
If you would have
talked to someone 30,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
40 years ago, they would
think about self-esteem

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.360 align:middle line:84%
by the cars we drive,
about how we dress,

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:84%
about their position in society,
and the power of the armies

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.810 align:middle line:90%
we could move.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And while that's
still a part of it,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
we've moved into what you
might think of as the quantum

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:90%
level of power.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:10%
Now we talk about power
plays, power relationships,

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.290 align:middle line:10%
power boundaries.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.860 align:middle line:84%
How often it is that
someone will say,

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.970 align:middle line:84%
in healing, we have to
take our power back.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Or, I feel like I have no
power in this relationship.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Or, I don't have any power
in this business situation.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:84%
We define ourselves in
the language of power

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:90%
for the first time ever--

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.940 align:middle line:84%
interior power,
not external power.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.910 align:middle line:84%
It's been such a
subtle transition

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:84%
into the language of
power that we actually

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
don't realize that we've
made this transition.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.540 align:middle line:84%
We are the first generation
to add power to self.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
There's an entire movement
around self-empowerment.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And inner power
is as illuminating

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
as it is intimidating, because
becoming empowered changes you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:90%
in ways you did not see coming.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:21.370 align:middle line:84%
We are in a discovery
zone of ourselves in a way

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.620 align:middle line:84%
that we have never,
ever been before, ever

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.540 align:middle line:90%
in the history of humanity.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.540 align:middle line:84%
That is such a big
sentence to drop on you.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's exactly
what is happening.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you the
three levels of self-esteem.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Survival self-esteem, level one,
refers to inner qualities that

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.130 align:middle line:84%
we develop in ourselves through
learning to rely on our own

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:90%
survival gut instincts--

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.910 align:middle line:84%
cleverness, for example, and our
capacity to endure and develop

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:90%
physical stamina in the world.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.910 align:middle line:10%
Inner self esteem comes
from the refinement

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.370 align:middle line:10%
of personal qualities
of character,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.130 align:middle line:10%
such as courage and
integrity, and learning how

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:10%
to rely on your values in life.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:10%
And the third level
of self-esteem

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:10%
is mystical self-esteem.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.840 align:middle line:10%
That's the capacity to rely
upon your inner spiritual

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:10%
experiences and
guidance, creating

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.230 align:middle line:10%
a harmonious balance between
your interior and exterior

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:90%
And here's a mystical truth--

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.710 align:middle line:84%
the power of who
you become is more

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
transforming for
others than anything

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
an ordinary person does.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:84%
We're discovering the
power of our nature.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.280 align:middle line:84%
This is such a great,
big, huge, big deal.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
It's so huge that it doesn't
even fit in our heads.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:01.250 align:middle line:84%
This explains so
much why in this era,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.520 align:middle line:90%
we have become hypersensitive.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:84%
We think that
everything we say has

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.920 align:middle line:90%
to be examined and processed.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And we become hypersensitive
about every word

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.570 align:middle line:90%
said to us and everything.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.650 align:middle line:90%
But there's a reason for that.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
The reason is because
in a different way,

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.420 align:middle line:84%
we have to learn about how
powerful we are, how much power

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:84%
is packed into
every word we say,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:44.590 align:middle line:84%
into every thought we have, into
how potent every single choice

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:90%
we make is, how potent we are.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
We are literally in a discovery
zone of a mine, M-I-N-E,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.840 align:middle line:84%
what's mine, and
a mind, M-I-N-D,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:04.080 align:middle line:84%
a mine and a mindfield of what's
in our mind and what is mine.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And the only way we will
learn to esteem ourself

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is to watch others
walk over ourself,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and to feel it, and go
ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.310 align:middle line:84%
You haven't paid
attention to me.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:90%
You've-- I heard you say that.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.780 align:middle line:84%
I heard you look at
me the wrong way.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And to hyper-respond to
when someone is walking

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
over you, a part of you.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:90%
And you feel it.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.741 align:middle line:90%
And it's one way--

00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:41.730 align:middle line:84%
one way-- that we
will become aware

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.950 align:middle line:84%
of what it is to feel
the power of ourselves

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
when it's out of ourself,
when we have no sense of it.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:84%
When we feel someone walking
over the mindfield of us,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
a fragment of ourselves, because
they didn't pay attention to us

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:84%
and we feel that,
they didn't esteem us.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
That's how we are beginning
to sense how powerful we are,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and how we utilize
it, how we become

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.950 align:middle line:84%
mindful of every word,
of every thought,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:84%
of the capacity we have to
help another person by one word

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
we say, and of the
destructive power we have.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.610 align:middle line:84%
We're learning this
for the first time

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
at the quantum
level of ourselves,

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:45.680 align:middle line:84%
the microcosm of
our own soul power.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's causing this
phenomenal transition

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:50.850 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:58.820 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
We all know that we
start out in a tribe,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:84%
so that our sense
of who we are is

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.180 align:middle line:84%
formed like clay
from the family,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
from the whole
that we grow up in.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.180 align:middle line:84%
We look at the
giants raising us,

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.880 align:middle line:84%
and we think, what
will they think?

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.870 align:middle line:84%
So to seek the
approval of the tribe

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is something that is brought up
in us, and it's inherent in us.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And it is not a bad
thing, because here's

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
an operative word that
you hold in your heart,

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.670 align:middle line:90%
because it's true.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:43.040 align:middle line:84%
We need to hold ourselves
accountable to ourselves

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and to the community
in which we live.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And that is part of self-esteem.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But a great challenge
of our time--

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and it is the inevitable
confrontation we all will face

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:84%
is that all of us are feeling
the awakening of that intuitive

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
voice in ourselves, that voice
that is speaking to us while we

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:17.060 align:middle line:84%
are a part of the whole,
while we sit with our tribe,

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
while we sit with
people we love dearly.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to introduce
a new word to you.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I love this word.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.887 align:middle line:90%
I love it, love it, love it.

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:90%
It's called charism.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Charism-- the word "charisma"
comes from "charism"--

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
but it means the grace
that only your soul has,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that only your soul has, that
single tone in this universe

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.010 align:middle line:84%
by which God knows your
name, your charism,

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.150 align:middle line:90%
the mission in your soul.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.190 align:middle line:90%
We are individuating now.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We're popping like
individual souls, longing

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:09.280 align:middle line:84%
to become whole, longing
to sense ourselves.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And when we live in our tribes,
we've been like cologne.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But we are longing to become
perfume, strong bottles

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
fragrant with our fullest
potential, sacred perfume,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:84%
where the smallest
drop of us can

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:34.627 align:middle line:84%
do a great act of transformation
on behalf of the whole.

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:35.960 align:middle line:90%
The whole is the operative word.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:41.600 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I see this transformation as an
archetypal one, a sacred rite

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:84%
that will help us
refine in ourselves that

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
quality of self-esteem
we must have

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.920 align:middle line:84%
in order for that holy
potential to emerge.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And I mean W-H, and I mean
H-O-L, our whole potential,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:90%
our charism, to come through.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.130 align:middle line:84%
It's the type of
self-esteem that

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:90%
is tested like an initiation.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.970 align:middle line:90%
It's an archetypal initiation.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Each of us is
going to have to be

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
on a kind of a
battlefield in our lives,

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
where the test of self-esteem
is that our old values,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.500 align:middle line:84%
we're going to have
to confront them.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the
first great obstacle,

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:49.070 align:middle line:84%
the first great confrontation,
is that place between them

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:90%
versus you.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And how many times
have you received

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:90%
a sense of inner instruction?

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.880 align:middle line:90%
You should do this.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.560 align:middle line:90%
You should do that.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.420 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you say this?

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:90%
Why don't you act on this?

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
But you've stopped
because you've

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.820 align:middle line:90%
said, what will they say?

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.620 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:90%
What will they say?

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll give you an example of one.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.680 align:middle line:90%
I will never forget this, never.

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:84%
This one woman wrote that she
had seen herself as a healer.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is classic.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
We decide we are someone who
can empower another person.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't recognize
about occupations of power

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:46.780 align:middle line:84%
is that they include a
journey of initiation.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:84%
So here is this woman,
and she's running.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
She's jogging, and
she sees this woman,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and her dog had just been hit.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.550 align:middle line:90%
She's screaming over the dog.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And she hears a
voice, and the voice

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:84%
said to go lay your
hands on that dog.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter that
it was a dog or a child.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.410 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:90%
It was her moment for that test.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And instead of her
listening to that voice,

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:17.550 align:middle line:84%
she stood there and
said, oh, what if I fail?

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.470 align:middle line:90%
What will they say?

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:90%
And she failed the test.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, this isn't about whether
or not the dog lived or died.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:31.930 align:middle line:84%
This is about the fact that in
that moment, her fear of being

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:84%
humiliated, and by
needing an outcome

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to be successful in order
for her to feel success,

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.470 align:middle line:84%
was greater than her saying,
OK, is that what you want

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:90%
me to do, and follow through.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.830 align:middle line:84%
The kind of self-esteem
I am talking about

00:14:52.830 --> 00:15:00.810 align:middle line:84%
is that you trust the interior,
the unreasonable self-esteem,

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:05.700 align:middle line:84%
the self that says I
am crossing the Rubicon

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and trusting the invisible
world where miracles are,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
the invisible world where
reason is disconnected from how

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
the events flow in my
life, so that I can

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.790 align:middle line:90%
allow guidance to take over.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is the difference
between my fate and my destiny.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Fate is when I allow fear
to decide my outcome.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:84%
But destiny is when I will
allow this inner guidance

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle line:90%
to decide it.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, you have the
opportunity for a new job.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
It represents everything
you've prepared for.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's hundreds of
miles away from you,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
your family of origin,
everything that's familiar,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:90%
your tribe.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.930 align:middle line:84%
The fate path makes
choices based on your fears

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and what's familiar,
what you think is safe.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
It's too much
trouble, you think.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you listen to your
tribe's collective fears

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.470 align:middle line:90%
about moving away so far.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Either way, you cave.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:84%
The destiny path, however, makes
choices based on discovery.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Sure, there's risk.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
But there's always the
possibility of growth.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:22.580 align:middle line:84%
What will I discover
about myself

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
if I make the choice
to enter something new?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Destiny always
includes discovery,

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
what you do not
know about yourself,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:37.950 align:middle line:84%
the unknown, what
you've yet to discover.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
When I will trust that, I
don't know what's out there,

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.430 align:middle line:84%
but I have this sense
of guidance that says,

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.270 align:middle line:90%
go this way.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And other people may
say, are you crazy?

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
what's out there!

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But that's the thing
about your sense of self.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It trusts a reality
greater than yourself.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.700 align:middle line:84%
How do you develop this
kind of self-esteem?

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I know, if you were
sitting with me right now,

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.050 align:middle line:84%
you would say, how
do you go there?

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.030 align:middle line:90%
How do you develop this?

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.369 align:middle line:84%
And lucky for you,
I'm going to tell you.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:16.190 align:middle line:84%
The first thing
is, pay attention

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to how easily you're humiliated.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.359 align:middle line:90%
Pay attention.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And watch how easily, watch how
easily you give your power away

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.420 align:middle line:84%
because you're so
afraid of that.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.390 align:middle line:84%
You have to make your
first conscious choice

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:37.100 align:middle line:84%
about paying attention
to what you think

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.928 align:middle line:90%
you needed for self-esteem.

00:17:38.928 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So why do I say that a
confrontation with the self,

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to self-esteem, is
inevitable, it's not an option?

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
It's because your old values are
inevitably going to fail you.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The self-esteem as we
know it is simply not

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
sufficient to manage
the challenges that

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
come from developing
intuition, that

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
come from the quality of
self that we need to develop

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.200 align:middle line:84%
to manage our health, and
because quite frankly,

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.040 align:middle line:84%
it's an archetypal
transformation.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We literally are becoming
different power machines.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:36.110 align:middle line:84%
We literally are transitioning
from five-sensory human beings

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.060 align:middle line:90%
to multi-sensory.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And the type of way that
we understood self-esteem,

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:84%
where we developed a
kind of an ego that

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
allowed us to protect
our home and get a job,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
is not the sufficient
kind of self-esteem

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:84%
that we need to protect
our inner power.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.900 align:middle line:84%
This is a whole
different quality.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:10%
And so the battlefield tactics
and basic survival antics

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:10%
in the world are
not sufficient when

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:10%
it comes to managing
the power of your soul.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:90%
It's just not good enough.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:27.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:84%
There is no truth in
your personal truth.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a big, huge
thing to understand?

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Personal truth is,
here's my personal truth,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
that I'm totally intimidated--

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.530 align:middle line:90%
this is the truth.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm personally
intimidated by snakes.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And snakes remind me of all
bad things in the world.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:90%
But there is no truth in that.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.040 align:middle line:84%
A truth is something that
applies to everybody,

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.390 align:middle line:90%
like the law of gravity.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Everybody falls if you push
them down off a cliff, something

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:90%
that is universal.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, it takes a lot
of esteem in oneself

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that my personal
truth is one level of truth.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
But my spiritual path has to
be governed by universal truth.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And the reason it
does is because that's

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:84%
the level at which my inner
being is creating my reality

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
to esteem myself so that I
actually begin to understand

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.690 align:middle line:84%
that I am co-creating
my reality,

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's not my personality
that's doing it,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.000 align:middle line:90%
but my inner nature.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Then, in order for me
to really understand

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.050 align:middle line:84%
how I'm co-creating my
reality, that I really have

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.660 align:middle line:90%
to take charge of my power.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And I need a level
of self-esteem

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:16.570 align:middle line:84%
that is much more sophisticated
than the level of personality.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay attention
to what your values are,

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
to how you behave, to what your
habits are, to how you respond

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.870 align:middle line:84%
when you're angry,
to how you respond

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:90%
to people in relationships.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And that is a tremendous test
of how you esteem yourself,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
how you interpret
what someone says

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:43.120 align:middle line:90%
to you, how you treat others.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about strategies
for developing self-esteem,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
true self-esteem.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:05.880 align:middle line:84%
When I think about how to
develop a sense of self,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.360 align:middle line:84%
one of the things I would
tell you is pay attention.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You have to first observe
yourself in action.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to observe how
you lose power in order

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:23.460 align:middle line:90%
to redefine power for yourself.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to how much
of your time and energy

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.500 align:middle line:84%
is spent looking for
other people's approval,

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:84%
how much of your day is
spent around planning

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and hoping other people
will see you or notice you,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:90%
or wondering what they will say.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Will this person approve of you?

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, take
time to do this.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And then actually calculate,
I spend a whole lot of my time

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.720 align:middle line:84%
looking for other
people's approval

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.680 align:middle line:84%
or making my decisions
on whether or not

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.990 align:middle line:84%
someone will approve of me
or approve of my decisions,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and how much of your
choice is based on that.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, Rick
discovered that he

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.730 align:middle line:84%
had at least 30 thoughts
in one day related

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to what his boss
was thinking about,

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not his boss
was thinking about Rick's job.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.060 align:middle line:84%
And Ann calculated that she
spent at least 15 minutes

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.360 align:middle line:84%
of each hour wondering
what others were thinking

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
about of her and whether or not
they were going to text her.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
Linda, who admitted

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.390 align:middle line:84%
that she spent at least
two hours every day

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:84%
getting ready in the
morning, because she

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.640 align:middle line:84%
was so concerned about what
other people would think

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:49.010 align:middle line:90%
about what she was wearing.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.160 align:middle line:90%
If you were to say this--

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.590 align:middle line:90%
"What should I do with my life?

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
What do you want me to
do in this moment?"--

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get an
answer to that prayer.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.740 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get guidance.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you get guidance,
what is your first instinct?

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Is it to dismiss the
guidance because it

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:90%
feels so frightening to you?

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Or is it to wonder,
what will people think?

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
Do you take your guidance
to the court of others?

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.340 align:middle line:84%
Or do you sit with
it in yourself

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and think, how am I
going to pull this off?

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:38.760 align:middle line:84%
If you take your inner
life to other people

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and give it to them
to pass around,

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.040 align:middle line:84%
and then give it back
to you after they've

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
chewed on it like
a bad steakbone,

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:84%
then you have no
sense of yourself,

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're setting yourself
up for the path of fate.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.305 align:middle line:90%
You're tossing yourself to fate.

00:24:58.305 --> 00:25:00.810 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you think, I have to make
this decision based on, what

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.540 align:middle line:90%
is my inner self telling me?

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Even at times if you
don't have clarity,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.420 align:middle line:84%
one thing you always do have
clarity on-- and you do--

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:84%
is what you know
you should not do.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.470 align:middle line:84%
What you know you should not
do, you are always clear about.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not sure
about what you should do,

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:34.020 align:middle line:84%
it's only because you're looking
for assurance of the outcome.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
your sense of self

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:90%
is true self-esteem is built.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.290 align:middle line:84%
One risky choice after
another, and that's

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.110 align:middle line:84%
how you learn to trust
your inner guidance,

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:84%
the guidance that
says, go this way.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.970 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell you why,
and I won't show you

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.540 align:middle line:84%
the outcome, because you create
the outcome with every choice

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:90%
in each moment.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:90%
There is only now.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.990 align:middle line:84%
The next moment is
created by this moment.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:08.500 align:middle line:84%
And each unreasonable choice
you make to believe in yourself,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.460 align:middle line:84%
you're changing the outcome
to something more spectacular.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's something you have
learned as you trust yourself.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So tune in to the lies
that you tell yourself.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:30.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, how often have
you said, I'm not unhappy?

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.890 align:middle line:90%
Or, I can handle this stress.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It's not that stressful for me.

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.130 align:middle line:90%
Or, sugar's not that bad.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.770 align:middle line:90%
I can have a little bit.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Or, just one more glass
of wine won't bother me.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I can take it.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.610 align:middle line:90%
These aren't little lies.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:90%
They may feel little.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.860 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Think of the consequences.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.220 align:middle line:84%
What's very important
is your capacity

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:90%
to tell yourself the truth.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.190 align:middle line:90%
That takes a lot of esteem.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you build
esteem in yet another way.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:11.450 align:middle line:84%
You learn how to discern the
difference between what's worth

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:17.630 align:middle line:84%
acting out and what isn't, that
it takes a whole lot of esteem

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to not respond to a
spectacle that you just

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.100 align:middle line:90%
should let pass you by.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.410 align:middle line:90%
So what is a spectacle?

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:32.240 align:middle line:84%
A spectacle is when someone
provokes you into an argument

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.080 align:middle line:84%
deliberately, and you
decide not to engage.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Or when someone says something
to you like, they're angry,

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.160 align:middle line:90%
and they just explode.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.220 align:middle line:84%
But you realize, they're
not really exploding at me.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:84%
They're just angry, and they
would explode at anybody.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.910 align:middle line:90%
And you just let it pass by.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.560 align:middle line:84%
It is just a spectacle,
and it's gone in a moment.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You begin to recognize,
I'm not getting

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:00.780 align:middle line:90%
attached to these things.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth it.

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
These are just the
spectacles of life,

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
that you learn to value
the power in your soul,

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that you realize, I'm
not responding to this.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.090 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth my energy.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not worth my soul.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not worth my
power, that you

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:28.100 align:middle line:84%
begin to make choices in your
life that reflect that you have

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:32.260 align:middle line:84%
a reverence for
yourself, that you

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:84%
start living the esteem that
you want others to hold you in.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.990 align:middle line:84%
So if you see someone
violating your moral values,

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't follow the tribe
and participate or just

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:49.650 align:middle line:84%
avert your eyes, as
if that's action.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:84%
You actually get up
and leave the table

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.230 align:middle line:90%
if someone mistreats a waitress.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Or you speak out and
represent your values

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.720 align:middle line:84%
when someone passes a
racial, negative comment

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.220 align:middle line:84%
about a group of people, instead
of sitting in cowardly silence,

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.025 align:middle line:84%
as if that represents
your values.

00:29:08.025 --> 00:29:10.790 align:middle line:90%


00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you an exercise,
because this is always

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.320 align:middle line:84%
good for you to have
a sense of yourself.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I tell people
this at workshops.

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Write down a list of
all the good things

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:27.970 align:middle line:84%
you've done all your whole
life, your whole life,

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.290 align:middle line:90%
all the good things you've done.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And then of course their
eyes roll backwards,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:84%
because they can't
possibly remember.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.910 align:middle line:90%
They can't possibly remember.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'll say, write down
the five or six times

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.460 align:middle line:90%
you've betrayed yourself.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And no one has difficulty
remembering that, nobody.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And here's the point
of that exercise.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Acts we do out of
low self-esteem

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.510 align:middle line:90%
stick like barnacles on a ship.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.490 align:middle line:90%
We remember those.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:84%
We remember when we
betrayed ourselves,

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.440 align:middle line:90%
and we never forget it.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, what makes
those acts of self-betrayal

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:84%
so bitter, in order
to live with it,

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.090 align:middle line:84%
we try and find
someone else to blame--

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.670 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have done this if
it wasn't for you or you--

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.110 align:middle line:84%
because it's just so difficult.
But in the end, in the end,

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:27.340 align:middle line:84%
the truth is we're the only
person that made the choice

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.570 align:middle line:90%
we did.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Self-esteem is the
only quality we

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:40.870 align:middle line:84%
can develop that has
the grace to give us

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:84%
the power to stand up and say,
I'll never betray myself again.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:90%
I will never lie again.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:49.910 align:middle line:90%
I won't do it.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I won't betray myself
or another person.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.870 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have that
sense of inner dignity,

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:03.030 align:middle line:84%
do you understand that it's
impossible to heal a disease?

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.040 align:middle line:10%
It's impossible.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Think of yourself like
a wood-burning stove.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Without true
self-esteem, you're going

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.480 align:middle line:84%
to run around your
life collecting twigs,

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.330 align:middle line:84%
looking for compliments,
for all kinds of things,

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:21.870 align:middle line:84%
stuffing this wood-burning
stove with twigs

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.510 align:middle line:84%
all the time to keep the
fire burning inside of you.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And twigs burn up like
this, because a compliment

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:90%
means nothing.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.090 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But when you have true
self-reverence for yourself,

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:43.200 align:middle line:84%
it's like putting a
huge Christmas log.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't need everybody else's
enforcement all the time.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's nice, but
you don't need it.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.180 align:middle line:90%
You don't need it.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, here's
what the actual blessing is.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:04.530 align:middle line:84%
You're able to give others
the love they are seeking.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
That is so hard for people
without self-esteem.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:84%
It is incredibly difficult to
genuinely love another person.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:84%
This is a journey worth taking,
no matter how long it takes you

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.210 align:middle line:90%
to get there, I promise you.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.860 align:middle line:90%
