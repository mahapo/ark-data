00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Archetypes are like the
keys to your own mystery.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:84%
They're the lens through
which you understand

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.840 align:middle line:84%
what motivates you,
why are you attracted

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:90%
to that person and not this.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:90%
They explain who you are.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:10%
Before I define
the word archetype,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:10%
let me toss out a question.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Why do you think you enjoy
people watching so much?

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And I won't even bother to ask
you if you people watch, like

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.820 align:middle line:84%
from a cafe or from
outside your house,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:90%
because I know we all do.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:90%
We can't stop ourselves.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And here's something
else we can't stop,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
and that's labeling
the people we watch.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.210 align:middle line:84%
We're compulsive about
having to tell ourselves

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
at least one thing about each
person we stop to notice.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we'll say
something like,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
that person looks like
a typical entrepreneur,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.350 align:middle line:84%
or I bet that woman is
a compulsive shopper,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:84%
or I bet that
person is an addict,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:84%
or maybe that person
is like a dancer,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
because I can tell by how
he or she moves their body.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.770 align:middle line:84%
But what you may not
know is why we're

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:90%
compulsive about labeling.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And what you are actually
doing is a reading,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
like an archetypal
reading, or intuiting

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:84%
an obvious archetypal
pattern in that person.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And get this, amazingly,
while you're reading them,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:90%
they're reading you.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.470 align:middle line:84%
A con artist, for example,
can sense a victim.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever wondered how
come con artists always

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:90%
find their victims?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Addicts always manage
to find addicts.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:84%
Knights can sense and
find a damsel in distress.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
The fact is we seek
out archetypal patterns

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that we're naturally attracted
to, like magnetic codes.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Even though we
don't think, I think

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I'll go look for an
archetypal pattern

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.470 align:middle line:84%
that I'm attracted to,
we don't think that way,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.810 align:middle line:90%
because it's unconscious.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
But there's magnetics
between us that archetypes

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:90%
resonate with and even radiate.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:84%
We each have four
survival archetypes

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.980 align:middle line:84%
in common and eight
unique archetypes

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:84%
that together, form
our individual nature.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:10%
You were born with 12
archetypal patterns that

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:10%
would, through the
years of your life,

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:10%
develop into the
characteristics of who you are.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:10%
The four archetypes that
we share are related

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:10%
to our earthly challenge of
survival and to the essential

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:10%
discovery of our self-esteem--

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:10%
the child, victim,
prostitute, and saboteur.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
The other eight
define our uniqueness.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:84%
In my research, the
consistent pattern

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that even
though there are

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:84%
endless archetypes in the
collective unconscious,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
each of us has a family of
12 intimate archetypes that

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.540 align:middle line:90%
govern our life path.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And while this may sound like
an incredible new idea to you,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.580 align:middle line:84%
the fact is you've already met
a number of your own archetypes.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.350 align:middle line:90%
You already know them.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.280 align:middle line:84%
You know them in the language
that you think about yourself.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
If I asked you to
describe yourself to me,

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:84%
you would pull out
your archetypes.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.310 align:middle line:84%
You would say, well,
you know, I'm a wife.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm a husband.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm an introvert.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm an extrovert.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm a natural networker.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:90%
I like to be of service.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
You would absolutely
describe yourself

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:90%
by labels or archetypes.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.210 align:middle line:10%
And you would assume
in this description

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:10%
that I would understand all
the characteristics that

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.060 align:middle line:10%
go with the one word
you use, because that's

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.650 align:middle line:10%
what an archetype is.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you
a big definition.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Because an archetype
is a pattern of power

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that we all just
automatically understand,

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
it transfers a language
that we just get in our gut.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So if I said to you, you know
what, that person's a geek,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to say to you that
person just gets technology

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.650 align:middle line:90%
and is everything I'm not.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:90%
I am so not a geek.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.270 align:middle line:84%
That is so not me,
because I don't

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.360 align:middle line:90%
have one geek archetype in me.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But I look at
these young people,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.420 align:middle line:84%
who have the geek in them,
and it comes naturally.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's what an archetype is.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.510 align:middle line:84%
It's a pattern that's in
you, that comes naturally,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.790 align:middle line:84%
that animates you, and it
gives you natural qualities

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.160 align:middle line:90%
that go along with it.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But an archetype
does something else.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
It's filled with
stories that go with it.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.780 align:middle line:84%
Like for example, the
princess archetype

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
has a huge backlog of stories
that go with the princess,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.170 align:middle line:84%
like Snow White and
all the many stories we

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.430 align:middle line:90%
have about princesses.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.060 align:middle line:84%
They have to have a knight,
and they have to be rescued.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It has to be romantic.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
We all know that, because
that's how the book is written.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.100 align:middle line:84%
When a woman has a
princess archetype,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:84%
she automatically
thinks in the language

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.490 align:middle line:84%
in the story of a princess,
and she unconsciously

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.110 align:middle line:90%
looks for a knight.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:84%
Detectives do something
called profiling when it

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.760 align:middle line:90%
comes to looking for criminals.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Profiling is another way
to think of archetypes.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
They profile, for
example, serial killers.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is profiling
archetypal patterns of people

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.380 align:middle line:90%
who murder in certain ways.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
But what they're
actually doing is

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
they're charting the archetypal
pattern of a person's

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
certain behavior that
they can count on.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:84%
And here's the
thing, what they say

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:84%
is this is the pattern
of this person.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And then that pattern
will be duplicated.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's an odd thing to use
a serial killer as an example,

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:90%
but here's the thing.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.960 align:middle line:84%
It's because it is a form
in our society, where

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.680 align:middle line:84%
the archetype has
become something

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
that an entire
agency relies upon.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And what they know is that
a pattern is consistent.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing
that makes it a pattern

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.850 align:middle line:90%
just like it is in us.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Our archetypes are
absolutely consistent.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.670 align:middle line:90%
It's what makes us who we are.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things that's
so fascinating about watching

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.300 align:middle line:84%
these detective movies is
that people are fascinated

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.100 align:middle line:84%
with the consistency of the
archetypes in those dramas,

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
because they're
looking at the patterns

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and how they chart patterns.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what is part of
the success of these stories.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
In my research as a medical
intuitive, after 35 years,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:51.220 align:middle line:84%
it became evident to me that
we have patterns of power that

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:84%
influence our behavior and
that those patterns are

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:84%
so consistent in
us and that there

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
are 12 fundamental
currents that duplicate

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
the order of the universe, that
there's 12 signs of the zodiac,

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
there's 12 hours in the day,
there's 12 hours of the night.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle line:84%
12 is like a cycle
of completion.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:25.210 align:middle line:84%
So 12 kind of completes us, and
there's 12 major power patterns

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:31.600 align:middle line:84%
in each of us that kind of
guide the journey of who we are.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.039 align:middle line:84%
And each of these power
patterns has a role

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:42.039 align:middle line:84%
to play in who we are and who
we are, so that each of us

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:84%
has a child
archetype, each of us

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.950 align:middle line:84%
has a victim we have
to contend with.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
We have 12 archetypes, and
these kind of direct the way

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.490 align:middle line:84%
in which we develop
in our lives.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:90%
We're not free floating agents.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:84%
We're quite governed
here in life.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
It as if we have what I
have called for years,

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:90%
a sacred contract with them.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
And see if you can
relate to this.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.712 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you're dating,
and if you are dating,

00:09:13.712 --> 00:09:15.670 align:middle line:84%
so you pay attention to
me here, because you're

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:18.670 align:middle line:90%
going to need to know this.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.770 align:middle line:84%
When people date, they
don't take all 12 archetypes

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.840 align:middle line:90%
on a date with them.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.750 align:middle line:84%
You tend to take your
three or four best

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.430 align:middle line:90%
archetypes out on a date.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:10%
Like, you may take
happy child out.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
You might take the archetypes
in you that you feel best in.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Say that you're
a healer, and you

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.340 align:middle line:84%
really like that
part of yourself,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and you love to
talk about healing.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.870 align:middle line:84%
You might take
your networker out,

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:84%
because you know exactly
how to be in the world.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
You might take your extrovert
if you're an extrovert.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.080 align:middle line:84%
The parts of yourself that
you feel very confident in.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But let's say, let's
say, that you also

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:84%
happen to be a gambler, and
you had a gambler archetype,

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
and you weren't yet sure how
to work with your gambler

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:84%
in a positive way, like how
to play hunches in a good way,

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
because the gambler is
a real positive side.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.830 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say
you weren't there yet.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And you thought,
this isn't the time

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
to tell this person
I'm a gambler,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.290 align:middle line:84%
and you decided
this isn't the time

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.020 align:middle line:84%
to tell this person I'm like
a great big huge addict.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.230 align:middle line:84%
So you leave those
archetypes at home.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:36.100 align:middle line:84%
And you just go out with
your magical child archetype.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
dating this person,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.660 align:middle line:84%
the other person thinks, this
is the most perfect person

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I have ever met in
the whole of my life.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:90%
And then you get married.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Archetypes are also collective.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Marriage is an archetype.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And so from the time
someone gets married,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:84%
that archetype kicks in,
and the marriage archetype

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.160 align:middle line:84%
is actually undergoing a
transformation right now.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.250 align:middle line:90%
But here's the thing.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
The marriage archetype
is about survival.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:16.140 align:middle line:84%
It is an archetype that is all
about the survival of a family,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.610 align:middle line:90%
of a tribe.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It's about security.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It's about creating a nest
to procreate and to make

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.770 align:middle line:90%
sure a tribe survives.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Marriage archetype was
never about romance.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:84%
This may blow you away,
but it's the truth.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.790 align:middle line:84%
The archetype goes way
back, way back, a long time.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.990 align:middle line:84%
Marriages were arranged long
before they were courtshipped

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and dated about love, where
individuals could decide

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to get married on their own.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Even today, a lot of
marriages are still arranged,

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:90%
because they're about survival.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.970 align:middle line:84%
So when people get married,
what happens in the collective

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.750 align:middle line:84%
unconscious-- and believe
you me, this happens--

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:11.670 align:middle line:84%
is that all 12 of your
archetypes come out with all 12

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:90%
of the other archetypes.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.030 align:middle line:10%
And how often does it happen
that two people will suddenly

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.480 align:middle line:10%
feel when they get married
and show up in their apartment

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:10%
together, that it's awfully
psychically crowded in here?

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, who is this
person I married?

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And what happens today is that
people start talking like this,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:90%
I need my own space.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I feel like-- this person
is crowding my territory.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I need more room here.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a psychic
response to the crowding

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.470 align:middle line:90%
in the archetypal airwaves.

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.520 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
But you can relate to
this because we are now

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
living in a time where
our unconscious is

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:90%
becoming conscious.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.270 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming very
much aware of relating

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
to each other
energetically, of feeling

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
each other's energetic content,
the content of our energy

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.020 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So let me get
personal with you now,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.210 align:middle line:84%
as if that wasn't
personal enough.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:90%
Let me get real personal.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
How many of you are in
the healing profession?

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.590 align:middle line:84%
When I'm teaching,
and I will ask

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
in an audience, how many
of you are in the healing

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.890 align:middle line:84%
profession, honestly these
days, 40, 50% of the hands

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:84%
go up, because the healer
archetype is a very prevalent

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.070 align:middle line:90%
archetype today.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.292 align:middle line:84%
Now that in itself
is fascinating.

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think
that's interesting?

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:90%
I think it's--

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm intrigued with it.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.730 align:middle line:84%
A great part of
the reason for that

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:58.010 align:middle line:84%
is because we've moved into
a holistic era, an era where

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:03.740 align:middle line:84%
healing has become an interior
art, as much as an exterior

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:90%
profession.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the healer
archetype is all

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
about the intuitive
voice of the healer,

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:19.950 align:middle line:84%
as well as the intellectual
knowledge of the healer.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So many of you who feel
or see yourself as healers

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
have declared yourself to be
a healer by some intuitive

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.100 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of who you are.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
You have a deep sense of
your archetypal pattern.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:90%
That pattern is talking to you.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:49.070 align:middle line:84%
Archetypes are so rich and
thorough that they actually

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
participate in the
events of your life.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.430 align:middle line:84%
They actually form
you, like clay.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And the healer, for
example, contains within it

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.120 align:middle line:84%
the journey of the
wounded healer.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:10%
It's the initiation
of forming you

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.920 align:middle line:10%
into becoming a genuine healer.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.860 align:middle line:84%
You just don't say to yourself,
you know what, I'm a healer,

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.650 align:middle line:84%
and you become a healer,
as if that's something

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.710 align:middle line:90%
you can just be.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
The healer archetype is
something you become,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
and you are formed
from the inside.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
And that requires a journey.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.260 align:middle line:84%
And you may have
already been through it.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:90%
If not, you will go through it.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you that
with absolute confidence.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the
archetypal journey.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you have the healer,
you will have this journey.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.970 align:middle line:84%
You can't not have
it, because it's

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.390 align:middle line:90%
part of the archetype itself.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, though I'm going to
use the healer extensively

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.220 align:middle line:84%
as an example to explain
the way archetypes

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.390 align:middle line:84%
work behind the
scenes in your life,

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:07.940 align:middle line:84%
let me be clear that all
archetypes, all of them

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
influence your life in
this kind of back room way.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example, the
victim or the judge

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
or the warrior or the servant or
the companion, they're endless.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.920 align:middle line:84%
You recognize if you
see your patterns,

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.670 align:middle line:84%
you can see exactly what will
inevitably emerge in you.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And as the healer, you
will be given a wound,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.510 align:middle line:84%
like an arrow shot
through your system.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:84%
That arrow will come
into your energy field

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.560 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere, which
means someone has been

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.040 align:middle line:90%
anointed to shoot that arrow.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
You have a contract
with this person.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:84%
This is why I called
it sacred contracts.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.970 align:middle line:90%
It is a contract.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:08.839 align:middle line:84%
Someone will be the wound giver
that you will have to heal.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
And that wound will
be devastating,

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:16.619 align:middle line:84%
because it has to be--
it won't be a broken leg.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:84%
It will be a soul
wound, not a body wound.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It will wound you
body, mind, heart,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.500 align:middle line:84%
and soul, because that is what
the wounded healer requires.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:90%
That is an initiatory wound.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.770 align:middle line:84%
The rescuer is an archetype
a lot of people relate to

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:44.810 align:middle line:84%
and each of these archetypes
has patterns of development that

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.480 align:middle line:84%
work behind the scenes
in you, so that you

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
get to know the part of you
that is the rescuer, like this.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.400 align:middle line:84%
It goes in search of rescuing
people in order to find love.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.480 align:middle line:10%
And that's the shadow
part of the rescuer,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.150 align:middle line:10%
because you're not
supposed to rescue people

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:10%
in order to be loved.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.260 align:middle line:90%
You know what that's like?

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:84%
That would be like
being a lifeguard who

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
pushes people in the pool, so
that he could go rescue them.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And then the lifeguard drags
that person out of the pool

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.420 align:middle line:84%
and follows them
home and decides

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.780 align:middle line:84%
to stay there, so that everyone
can say, you are so wonderful.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.240 align:middle line:84%
You rescued me
from drowning today

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and then expects to have
dinner, lunch, breakfast,

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:90%
and get rewards all day long.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.390 align:middle line:84%
But he pushed him in the
pool in the first place.

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And then that lifeguard
can't figure out

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:84%
why people stopped
going to the pool.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Looking for rewards, looking for
compliments, looking for meals.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.130 align:middle line:84%
It was a private agenda
that the lifeguard added

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.870 align:middle line:90%
on that came from his shadow.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
that lifeguard

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:84%
is going to have to sit down
and say, what am I doing wrong

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.810 align:middle line:90%
here?

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the lifeguard
will go over to a therapist,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.000 align:middle line:84%
say, you gotta help me
out, because every time

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm rescuing people,
they're not appreciating me.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.150 align:middle line:90%
I take them home.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.950 align:middle line:90%
We have a meal.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:13.750 align:middle line:90%
They thank me.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But then I show up the next
day, and pretty soon, I

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:90%
get the cold shoulder.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, the
person says, I don't

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.990 align:middle line:84%
think you're supposed
to push him in the pool.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I think you're supposed
to wait until there's

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:90%
a call to be rescued.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Then I think you're supposed
to dive in, pull him

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
to the side of the pool,
make sure they're all right,

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
and then get back on your perch
and wait for the next person.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the role of the empowered
archetype of the rescuer.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
You may not know who
the participants will

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:84%
be in these experiences
or when they will happen.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But what your knowledge
of your archetypes gives

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.490 align:middle line:84%
you is this capacity
to be impersonal

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:84%
about the personal events
that unfold in your life.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.640 align:middle line:90%
How much power is that?

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:84%
If you talk about
sacred power, this

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is like the apex
of that position.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.820 align:middle line:84%
This is, like
Plato said, when he

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:84%
said the gods are archetypes,
they live like Zeus

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
at the top of Mount
Olympus looking upon us,

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.620 align:middle line:90%
but they are patterns of power.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.750 align:middle line:84%
A soul journey is the
journey with your soul.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It requires that you need
your soul to endure it,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.710 align:middle line:90%
emphasis on the word endure.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.470 align:middle line:90%
It is a make or break journey.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:10%
You will reach a
point in this journey

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:10%
where you understand
you may not make it.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:52.250 align:middle line:90%
You may not make it.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean necessarily
that you may not live,

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.260 align:middle line:90%
but you may not live well.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:08.970 align:middle line:84%
You may live this sense
that you are just surviving.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:10%
But if you decide, I've got
to heal this, no matter what,

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:20.980 align:middle line:10%
and I've got to find resources
in me that I didn't know I had,

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:10%
now the healer will
wake up in you.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And if you knew the story
of the wounded healer,

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.030 align:middle line:84%
if at that moment,
you recognized,

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:35.110 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, this is the arrow,
the first thing you would do

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:84%
is forgive the one
who shot it to you.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
The first is that you
would bow to that person

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.220 align:middle line:84%
and say, thank you,
my journey's begun.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
That's the first.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.290 align:middle line:84%
The second is that you would
detach from that person

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
and detach from how
the wound was given

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and begin the walk in
gratitude that says, OK,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.000 align:middle line:90%
here's my fire walk.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.970 align:middle line:90%
I've got to make it to the end.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
You would become impersonal
about the personal journey

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.370 align:middle line:90%
given to you.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Why do you need to
know your archetypes?

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.690 align:middle line:90%
Because you need this map.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
Without the ability to
reference your own life

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
in the impersonal,
you won't make it.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:90%
It's never going to be easy.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.110 align:middle line:90%
But it won't be clear.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:90%
And you need that clarity.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.210 align:middle line:90%
You need soul clarity.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing like
soul clarity, nothing,

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:84%
because the mind will
play tricks on you.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And the mind will say,
resent that person.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And what good will
that ever do you?

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So let me tell you
about another archetype

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.118 align:middle line:84%
you're going to relate
to, because we all

00:22:40.118 --> 00:22:42.190 align:middle line:90%
have the saboteur.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And you need to understand
the saboteur in you.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And like all
archetypes, it, too,

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:55.840 align:middle line:84%
will visit you with a
journey because the role

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
of each archetype in
us is to educate us

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.750 align:middle line:90%
on the nature of our own power.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Everything is always about our
power, everything, everything.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So put this jewel in
your little jewel pouch.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
When you are in a situation
in your life, in a cloud,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.670 align:middle line:84%
in a fog, and you're not
sure what's going on,

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and you need a reference,
there are a couple

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.670 align:middle line:84%
of words I can
give you that will

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:34.120 align:middle line:90%
be like candles in the night.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And the first word I'm
going to give you is power.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
This situation,
even if I don't know

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.420 align:middle line:84%
where I'm going, even if
I don't know what to do,

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:90%
it has to do with power.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:90%
It has to do with my power.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:84%
And then the second thing
is you ask yourself,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.670 align:middle line:90%
where am I losing my power?

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
What has this got to do as a
test for my own empowerment?

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
You become
immediately impersonal

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.550 align:middle line:84%
about your own life in that
second, immediately impersonal.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
You detach from your own
life, just as if in order

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:17.990 align:middle line:84%
to heal an illness,
your best position

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.590 align:middle line:84%
is to become impersonal
about that illness.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.330 align:middle line:90%
It's not your cancer.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.250 align:middle line:90%
It is cancer.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.810 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is personal.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, to understand
the saboteur, I

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.300 align:middle line:84%
love teaching the
saboteur archetype.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.750 align:middle line:84%
I just love it because
everybody is always

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.413 align:middle line:84%
wrong about what
they think it is.

00:24:44.413 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And they think it's some
like ghoulish gargoyle that

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
comes out of somewhere, and
it's going to sabotage you,

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.960 align:middle line:90%
and that is so not right.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.710 align:middle line:84%
The saboteur is a pattern
in us, and this pattern

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.980 align:middle line:84%
is so consistent,
it is archetypal.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:90%
I know you do this.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know you,
and I know you do this.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's every
human being will

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:90%
sabotage their own empowerment.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my workshops
people have said

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.410 align:middle line:84%
to me for years and years
and years and years,

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:17.890 align:middle line:90%
I am afraid of failure.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:90%
No one's afraid of failure.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.040 align:middle line:90%
There is no such thing.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So check that off and get
that out of your head.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.670 align:middle line:84%
What people are afraid
of is responsibility.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.452 align:middle line:90%
They are afraid of empowerment.

00:25:33.452 --> 00:25:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And here's the mystery.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So what you get to say now
is, you're right Caroline,

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrified of empowerment.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And now I'll
explain why you are.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:84%
It's because empowerment
is a different level

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.170 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
People are afraid, intimidated
by becoming more conscious,

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.460 align:middle line:90%
because it's all about truth.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.530 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's afraid of success.

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.300 align:middle line:90%
What a ridiculous thing to say.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.580 align:middle line:90%
People are afraid of truth.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:12.070 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of becoming
more able to see clearly,

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
because what that
does is it reduces

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.790 align:middle line:84%
one's relationship with
darkness, with the capacity

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:84%
to lie, with the capacity to
choose weakness over strength.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.310 align:middle line:90%
So we sabotage ourselves.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.360 align:middle line:90%
We sabotage.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
When an opportunity to
empower ourselves comes along,

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:41.320 align:middle line:84%
it's about, do I want to
empower myself to such a level

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that I become able to see the
truth in my life that clearly?

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Because there's no going back.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:84%
No, I think I'll
sabotage myself.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
This is where people
blame their childhood.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:58.090 align:middle line:84%
So the reason you need
to know your saboteur

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is you need to see
exactly how you

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.330 align:middle line:90%
will sabotage your empowerment.

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.520 align:middle line:84%
You have to ask
yourself, what is

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:90%
it I don't want to see clearly?

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.340 align:middle line:10%
You obviously see that I can
go on for years and years

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:10%
about archetypes, and
I'm not kidding you.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
But the next
natural question you

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.480 align:middle line:84%
have for me is how do I
know my own archetypes?

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So let me answer that
question for you.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.220 align:middle line:90%
That much I can do.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:84%
First of all, get this, you
should ask your friends,

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.680 align:middle line:84%
because your friends already
can spot your patterns.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep your myths
or your archetypes hidden

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.500 align:middle line:84%
from your friends
anymore than they

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.330 align:middle line:90%
can keep them hidden from you.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But you already know a great
deal more about yourself

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:90%
than you realize.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:90%
But I'll give you this clue.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:51.742 align:middle line:84%
Your archetypes are not
in your personality.

00:27:51.742 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You know how many times
women will say-- usually it's

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:57.310 align:middle line:84%
always women, that will pick
out archetypes in my workshops.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.133 align:middle line:90%
They'll say, I'm the queen.

00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, why do you
think you're a queen?

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say because I don't
like to be told what to do.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.380 align:middle line:90%
That's not a queen.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.050 align:middle line:90%
A queen is a noble force.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:14.590 align:middle line:84%
A queen is someone who takes
care of her responsibilities.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Stubborn is a bully.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Stubborn is a coward.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not a queen.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Your patterns are a
consistent behavior in you,

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.530 align:middle line:84%
like if you're a
hermit, you know it.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.230 align:middle line:90%
You know it's what you crave.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Use the word crave
as a guidance.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.910 align:middle line:90%
You crave space.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.220 align:middle line:90%
You crave time alone.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.910 align:middle line:84%
You crave it
because you need it.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, don't think of all
these archetypes as negative.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Let me be very clear here.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:48.890 align:middle line:84%
An archetype is a
neutral pattern,

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:90%
and yes, it has a shadow.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow means
it's just something

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:90%
that is unknown about it.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It means that the part
of it that's unknown

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:04.720 align:middle line:84%
is going to come out
in the unconscious.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.410 align:middle line:84%
So if, for example, I'm
going to take something that

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:90%
sounds negative, like gossip.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're someone who can't
bear to see someone get ahead

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.410 align:middle line:84%
of you, and your way of dealing
with that is to sabotage them

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.340 align:middle line:84%
through gossip, and if I said
to you, why do you do that?

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:90%
Why do you do that?

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Why are you so intimidated by
the success of other people?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:90%
You might say, I don't know.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:90%
That's your shadow answering.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:10%
And then I would say to you,
you sit yourself down, missy,

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.510 align:middle line:10%
because we're going to
get to the root of why you

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:10%
don't know yourself that well.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You should be able to answer
every question about yourself

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.730 align:middle line:90%
at your age.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you say to
me, I better go into my shadow

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.210 align:middle line:90%
and figure that out.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, that part
of you that's the gossip

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.330 align:middle line:84%
turns around and
becomes an asset.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:57.780 align:middle line:84%
You start writing
for newspapers,

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.230 align:middle line:90%
you become Ann Landers.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:03.990 align:middle line:84%
And you use that skill,
because everything

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
has its powerful potential,
everything, absolutely

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.320 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can spot
archetypes in our society,

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and they define the
health and the direction

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.900 align:middle line:90%
our society is moving in.

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'll give you a clue.

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:27.990 align:middle line:84%
You know the
vampire archetype is

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:31.680 align:middle line:84%
a very toxic archetype,
an extraordinarily toxic

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.640 align:middle line:90%
archetype.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And yet it's become popular.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.740 align:middle line:84%
The vampire is the archetype
that sucks the life out.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Your fifth chakra, it
bites you in the neck,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.510 align:middle line:84%
and it takes out the power
of choice, takes it out.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.020 align:middle line:84%
It is no coincidence
that the vampire is now

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:90%
seen as romantic.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It's seen as something
people want to aspire to.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And so unconsciously,
the vampire archetype

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.260 align:middle line:90%
is in our collective.

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.170 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how to
language it literally,

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.730 align:middle line:84%
but we are languaging it
in our collective this way.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.360 align:middle line:90%


00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:20.550 align:middle line:84%
Archetypes are the language
of our symbolic life.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are a map
into the patterns

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:33.200 align:middle line:84%
that drive you inside yourself
and around, around you.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.750 align:middle line:10%
And so to know your
archetype is really

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:10%
to have access to the map
of your soul, your soul,

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:46.280 align:middle line:10%
and to understand
what drives you.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It is worth you
spotting your archetypes

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that every
single archetype will pull out

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of the shadow to move
you into the light.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.280 align:middle line:90%
That's how we're wired.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.230 align:middle line:90%
That, too, is archetypal.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:middle line:90%
We can't get away from it.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.690 align:middle line:84%
That's how heaven
has wired this,

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.290 align:middle line:90%
because the journey is sacred.

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And the wonderful thing is
we all have it in common,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.640 align:middle line:84%
there isn't one
person who is not

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.300 align:middle line:84%
on this journey
of the maturation

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.280 align:middle line:90%
of their archetypal instincts.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you think
about is it worth

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:36.400 align:middle line:84%
knowing to put the time in,
think about know thyself,

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.800 align:middle line:90%
and you will know your universe.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.910 align:middle line:90%
It is the truth.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.700 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:55.424 align:middle line:90%
