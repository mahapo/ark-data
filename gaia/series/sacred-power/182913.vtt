00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.630 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.190 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the greatest surprises
for me was I thought everybody

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.900 align:middle line:90%
wanted to heal.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.050 align:middle line:84%
It was such a shock
to me to realize

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.290 align:middle line:84%
that healing is one of the
most intimidating journeys

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.580 align:middle line:90%
of the human experience.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:90%


00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever met someone
for the first time--

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.150 align:middle line:84%
could be a man,
could be a woman--

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.700 align:middle line:84%
and instantly that
person started to share

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.930 align:middle line:90%
all their problems with you?

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:84%
Their aches, their
pains, problems

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.480 align:middle line:84%
they have at work or
family, life in general.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And you've just met this
person, and all of a sudden you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
know their entire
medical history?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether consciously
or unconsciously,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:84%
this person is living in
wounds, and that power of wounds

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.690 align:middle line:84%
has become a very
seductive social tool,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.420 align:middle line:84%
it's powerful social
currency, and it's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.930 align:middle line:84%
become a powerful
language for people today.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.010 align:middle line:90%
It's what I call woundology.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.070 align:middle line:84%
Now most of us aren't this
obvious about our wounds,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.830 align:middle line:84%
or at least we would like
to think that we're not.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And while we assume that
we all want to heal,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
the reality is that many
people fear becoming healthy

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:90%
and that's extraordinary.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:84%
That may be hard for you
to hear and you may even

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.210 align:middle line:84%
actually recoil at the
thought that people

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
find being healthy
frightening, even intimidating.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what
I've learned is

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
that when we think
of being healthy,

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.770 align:middle line:84%
we have to live up to
our fullest potential.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:10%
And while we like to imagine
our fullest potential,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:10%
actually living it is one of
the most frightening things

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.550 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We've created a
social environment,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
in fact, in which
pain has privileges.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:10%
We expect to be rewarded or
compensated for our suffering,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:10%
and actually, that's what's made
us the litigious society we've

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:10%
become.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.570 align:middle line:84%
So when our wounds prove to be
an effective way of influencing

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.210 align:middle line:84%
others or controlling
others, healing

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.630 align:middle line:84%
ceases to be the positive goal
that it looks like on paper,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, healing
becomes a threat.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is amazing,
but health has never

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.960 align:middle line:90%
had the cloud of a wound.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Just-- it's an extraordinary
thing to think of it.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:90%
But here's what's truth--

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.360 align:middle line:84%
you're not meant
to stay wounded.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:90%
What in nature stays wounded?

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Animals heal, nature heals,
trees heal, plants heal.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
We are never meant
to stay wounded.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.010 align:middle line:90%
So why do we?

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.407 align:middle line:84%
We have to move beyond the
consciousness of the wound,

00:03:01.407 --> 00:03:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I want
to talk to you about.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Breaking through a
pattern of woundology

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.640 align:middle line:84%
is equal to or even more
rigorous than healing

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
the wound itself, and
understanding why it's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.540 align:middle line:90%
important can change your life.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.480 align:middle line:84%
So what is woundology and
what does it look like?

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think the best way
for me to explain it to you

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
is to share a couple of
great woundology stories

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:90%
and examples.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
I was meeting a
friend for lunch,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and this friend was
approaching the table where

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.360 align:middle line:84%
I was seated with
a couple of people

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that I had just met--
we were all strangers.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And while we were
waiting for her,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.750 align:middle line:84%
another person came
in and asked her

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:84%
if she happened to
be free on June 8.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Now all this individual asked
her was, are you free June 8?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And she was looking for
a yes or a no answer,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.240 align:middle line:84%
but instead, this
individual said, June 8?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.110 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.480 align:middle line:84%
That is my incest
support group meeting

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:84%
and I never let
these people down.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm always there on June 8,
I'm always there for them,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and we never ever
disappoint each other,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and she went on and on and on
for at least two-and-a-half

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:90%
minutes.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Now this individual who had
asked the question said,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:90%
oh, OK, and walked away.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But I watched a
unbelievable display

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.720 align:middle line:84%
of information roll out of her
that nobody needed to know.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Within two minutes,
all these strangers

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
knew that she had been
a victim of incest,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.740 align:middle line:84%
that she was angry about it,
that she was in a support

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
group, but that was just
the first layer of the cake.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.160 align:middle line:84%
The second was that
it was very obvious

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.090 align:middle line:84%
that her intention in
communicating that information

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:90%
was that she wanted them--

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
everybody at the table to
treat her in a certain way

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
because she was a, quote-quote,
"victim" of incest.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.300 align:middle line:90%
She had an agenda.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Later, when we were sitting
at lunch, I said to her,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.380 align:middle line:90%
I have to ask you a question--

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
why did you want them to know
you were wounded that way?

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, specifically
a victim of incest?

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Because that's so
incredibly personal.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.305 align:middle line:90%
And she said, because I am.

00:05:30.305 --> 00:05:32.970 align:middle line:90%


00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Now that to me
open my eyes, and I

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.770 align:middle line:84%
began to listen to
people differently.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.750 align:middle line:84%
That in fact, when we are
wounded, when we suffer,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
part of us immediately engages
in who is responsible for this

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
and what am I owed as a result?

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.060 align:middle line:84%
How should this
be repaired in me?

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.190 align:middle line:84%
Now we don't realize that
woundology has become so much

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:84%
a part of our subcutaneous
social tissue, but it has.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
And we don't realize how much
we play the woundology card

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:90%
in our lives, but we do.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
We live in a society where being
wounded and using the wound

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.390 align:middle line:84%
is deeply supported, and
it comes from the idea

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that suffering somehow or
other shouldn't happen to us.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.060 align:middle line:84%
That there is something wrong
in the whole idea that how

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.280 align:middle line:90%
could this happen to me?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:84%
We have an idea
deep in our core--

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
deep in our core, if we're
a good person, quote,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
"bad things should
never happen to us."

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.190 align:middle line:84%
That we should never be
wounded, that we should never

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
have a bad childhood,
that bad things

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.840 align:middle line:84%
should never happen to
us in the first place.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But if they do, if
they do, somehow,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:13.250 align:middle line:84%
wounds become like a sieve,
and that the pain that we have,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we get to pass on because
we've never done anything

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle line:84%
in the first place
to get this wound,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.050 align:middle line:84%
so we get to punish
other people with it.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:84%
We punish people, but we
are really raging at God.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.370 align:middle line:84%
We are angry that God
somehow messed up.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.270 align:middle line:84%
There's been a cosmic
glitch, and this situation

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.490 align:middle line:90%
was not supposed to happen.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm upset that my life
is unfolding in a way

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that I don't want
it to, and I need

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.440 align:middle line:84%
to let everyone know
that I am angry.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that if I
can get angry enough,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that God, like a parent,
will finally cave

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:90%
and I'll get what I want.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.750 align:middle line:84%
Now understand that
this is a deeply primal,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:90%
organic response.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
This reaction is based on your
ancient tribal soul's belief.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:84%
How many times have
you either done this

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:90%
or has it been done to you?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Where someone's come
home from work and said,

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I've had a bad day, and
they've yelled at you?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Or you've yelled at them?

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Or you've taken the
rage or the anger

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
and passed it through
you to somebody else?

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:31.410 align:middle line:84%
You've used the wound
and delivered the rage.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.169 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
to heal that rage,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't be able to
pass it on to someone else.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
I've asked people
in my workshops

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and I've said, how
many of you, how

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
many of you, when
you meet people,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:53.150 align:middle line:84%
make it a point to share your
wounds right up front when

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:90%
you meet them?

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Or within the early
stages, as a way of saying,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.870 align:middle line:84%
if you want to get
to know me better,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.440 align:middle line:84%
these are the things you
have to know about me.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
You have to know
where I was wounded

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and what my childhood was like
or what my past history was

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.020 align:middle line:90%
like, you have to know that.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:17.215 align:middle line:84%
And mostly everybody raises
their hands and says,

00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:84%
yes, that's part of who I am
and that's part of my history.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And what it does
is it establishes

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.890 align:middle line:84%
a type of wound intimacy
between two people,

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:32.800 align:middle line:84%
so they feel like that
establishes a kind of wounded

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
language of how to
support me and what

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:90%
I expect in terms of intimacy.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And without the wound,
a person doesn't

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
know how to be
sensitive, a person

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.640 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know how
to be protected.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't have
that wounded language,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
we don't know how to
also control somebody,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.970 align:middle line:84%
but you can't expect as much
from me because I'm not strong,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.410 align:middle line:84%
you can't you have
to take care of me,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to fulfill
all my responsibilities

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not feeling well.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It is an extraordinary thing
to think that health requires

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.710 align:middle line:90%
us to be fully empowered.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And so the wound, so long
as we hold onto the wound,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
so long as we keep ourselves
not fully healthy, then

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
we have an excuse or
reasons to not carry

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
our full responsibility in
the world or in our life,

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.970 align:middle line:84%
or to not quite be the
full person that we'd like

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:57.780 align:middle line:90%
to imagine ourselves becoming.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:07.730 align:middle line:84%
So what is being whole and
why doesn't it appeal to us?

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.790 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we don't have
a model, a template of what

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.980 align:middle line:84%
a whole person is,
and actually, that

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
might sound extraordinary
to you, but it's the truth.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:24.190 align:middle line:84%
We speak about whole,
we talk about wholism,

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.380 align:middle line:84%
we talk about
body, mind, spirit,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.090 align:middle line:84%
but actually, we don't
have a iconic whole person

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that we say, that's
exactly what we want to be.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't appeal to us.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:10%
Because when we think
about being whole,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:10%
what we think about is being
invulnerable, being invincible,

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:10%
and not having any entry
points to having needs,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.500 align:middle line:10%
being emotional, being
cozy and huggable.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We think about someone
who's very Herculean.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
And so we hold onto our
wounds because that's

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.010 align:middle line:90%
how we stay approachable.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
That's how we think
we stay normal.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:84%
That's how we think we
stay needy, and we can--

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.480 align:middle line:84%
not just needy, but we can
be needed by being wounded.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:84%
If we become totally healed
and whole, no one will need us,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and that is an unconscious fear.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Like, how will we ever attract
anyone to us if we're whole?

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.310 align:middle line:90%
How will they find us?

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, if we don't--

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
we actually think that
the way we are needed

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
or the way we can
be in a relationship

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
is that we must be vincible,
we must be wounded.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, that's our
key to being partnered.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, there's a
vocabulary that we have

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:90%
to bypass as a whole person.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.810 align:middle line:84%
For example, we can't
use the word blame.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.840 align:middle line:90%
We can't use the word deserve.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.460 align:middle line:84%
We can't take the things--
the events that happen to us

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
and say that it's anybody
else's fault because it's not.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a tactic
that doesn't work.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.780 align:middle line:90%
These are powerless strategies.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
The shadow side of
the word "deserve"

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.710 align:middle line:84%
often comes from
a wound, and you

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.660 align:middle line:84%
will stay wounded in order
to indulge your weakness,

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.870 align:middle line:90%
for example, an addiction.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And by saying that
you had a bad day,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.290 align:middle line:84%
you deserve to engage
that weakest part of you.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
Pain becomes your
ticket, so to speak.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I've had a pain,
now I deserve a vacation.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, without pain, how
will I ever get to Hawaii?

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to evolve
beyond the point

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that in order to
enjoy something,

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:90%
you have to go through pain.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Think about how much in your
life, how many times you've

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:90%
said, you know what?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I deserve this because
I've had a bad day,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.130 align:middle line:84%
or I deserve this because
nothing's working for me.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for
us to say, you know what?

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do this
because I want to.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Because I want to.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult for
us to just go out and say,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm going on vacation.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.230 align:middle line:84%
Everybody sits
around and says, why?

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.000 align:middle line:90%
What's your reason?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Our whole social
way of thinking is

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
that we have to have
reasons for why we do

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:90%
something nice for ourselves.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:84%
I get to have a vacation
because I'm exhausted,

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.100 align:middle line:84%
or something bad happened,
so now I can balance it

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.270 align:middle line:90%
with something good.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the wound comes in.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.760 align:middle line:84%
I've had a terrible
time, so now I

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.650 align:middle line:84%
deserve a very good time, ergo
the word "deserve" comes in.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Wounds have been very,
very helpful for us.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I was in Moscow one time.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:84%
It was 30 below zero, and
I'm waiting to get on a bus.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:84%
There's this long line,
and 30 below zero is cold.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And so all of these people
are waiting to get on a bus,

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and up walks this man
to the head of the line,

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.660 align:middle line:84%
and he's yelling
something in Russian,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and everybody has to get out of
his way, and they backed off,

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.860 align:middle line:84%
and they let him get
on the bus first.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And someone that I was
with explained to me

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:43.000 align:middle line:84%
that what he said was, I was
at the Battle of Stalingrad,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:84%
get out of my way,
and everybody did.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
What he did was, he said, I
have suffered more than you--

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.150 align:middle line:90%
move.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:90%
And everybody did.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.860 align:middle line:90%
He pulled out his wounds.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:02.930 align:middle line:84%
Now it's really extraordinary
that in our suffering,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
we have this interesting
sense that life has

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.590 align:middle line:90%
to balance somehow or other.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.250 align:middle line:90%
This one cannot be for nothing.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we have structured
our lives that in a sense,

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:84%
we almost hold on to our wounds
until we get an explanation.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:84%
If it's the case, that this
wound is without reason

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
that's almost an
unbearable possibility.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So somehow we must find
reason in our suffering.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is part of the
interesting structure

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:90%
of human nature.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.935 align:middle line:90%
There's got to be a reason.

00:16:52.935 --> 00:16:57.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:84%
But what do you do
if you recognize

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:90%
you're a woundologist?

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.240 align:middle line:10%
I use someone who
manipulates with your wounds,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:10%
and I'll ask you,
what's your style.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.150 align:middle line:84%
For example, I've said
to people in my workshop,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
do you manipulate
with your wounds?

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Do you, for example,
ever say things like,

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:90%
I've had a worse time than you.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.329 align:middle line:84%
This comes from my
childhood, however it

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
is you manipulate people,
and it causes people

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:90%
to treat you in a certain way.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:90%
Are you a wounded child?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.010 align:middle line:84%
Here's a very
popular archetype--

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and I say archetype, the
wounded child archetype

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:42.560 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most powerful
archetypes active in us today.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:10%
And that pattern in us from
feeling neglected as a child,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.410 align:middle line:10%
abandoned, abused, that part
can come out and very much

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:05.020 align:middle line:10%
participate in your adult life.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin using
the pattern of the wounded

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:16.150 align:middle line:84%
child in your everyday
life, or you could be

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.910 align:middle line:90%
manipulated by a woundologist.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Here's one of my
favorite stories.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I was teaching a workshop one
time in northern Scotland.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a man in my
workshop and he was--

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.070 align:middle line:84%
oh, he must've
been 70 years old.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.150 align:middle line:84%
And everything about him was
like a child, everything.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.900 align:middle line:84%
So this man, on break
time, comes back

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.760 align:middle line:84%
to my workshop carrying a
teddy bear, a teddy bear.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Now-- and he's sitting there,
all the women around him

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.990 align:middle line:84%
started to coddle him like,
oh, the poor little guy--

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:55.340 align:middle line:84%
this was such a classic
example of a wounded

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.355 align:middle line:90%
child in a 70-year-old body.

00:18:58.355 --> 00:19:01.793 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, are
you kidding me?

00:19:01.793 --> 00:19:04.730 align:middle line:90%
But it was working.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.230 align:middle line:90%
It was working.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:11.480 align:middle line:84%
He had absolutely no
intention, no intention

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.870 align:middle line:90%
of ever breaking that pattern.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.610 align:middle line:90%
And here's the thing--

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
he was in a workshop
with me for healing.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:90%
For healing.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.470 align:middle line:90%
He had no intention of healing.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's the paradox in
our nature, don't you know it.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:33.720 align:middle line:84%
How often do we look
like we're healing,

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:37.590 align:middle line:84%
walk like we're healing,
talk like it, but we're not?

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.430 align:middle line:90%
But we're not?

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what I mean
about woundology.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
We set ourselves on the path
of wanting to be healthy,

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.040 align:middle line:90%
and then we eat the wrong foods.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.840 align:middle line:84%
The excuses that we give
ourselves to overeat sugar

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
or to not exercise or to not do
what we know we should be doing

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.020 align:middle line:90%
will always come from a wound.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:08.110 align:middle line:84%
So how do you break the pattern
of woundology in yourself?

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:90%
First of all, we have to--

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.470 align:middle line:84%
just assume you are,
because everybody is

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.840 align:middle line:90%
a woundologist to some extent.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's just a language
we've all learned to speak

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.450 align:middle line:90%
because it's everywhere.

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:84%
What we have to recognize is
that we are reason-driven.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.880 align:middle line:90%
We need a reason for everything.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And that that's
just the way we are,

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:84%
and that if we
don't get a reason,

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.840 align:middle line:90%
we will dwell in our wounds.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing about
breaking woundology

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.030 align:middle line:84%
is that we have to
accept something.

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.110 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a logical reason for
why things happen as they do.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:90%
There just isn't.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
It would take a long
class and theology and who

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:84%
knows what else,
but let's just get

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:84%
to the point of accepting
that not one of us

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.190 align:middle line:90%
is the center of the universe.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.500 align:middle line:84%
That the events that
happen in our lives

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.170 align:middle line:90%
are not built around us.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.640 align:middle line:84%
That in fact, while there
may be reasons for why

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.470 align:middle line:90%
things happen as they do--

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and there certainly
are, the reasons why

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:84%
they happen are not
built around any of us,

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:90%
they're built around all of us.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
And so we're all
in this together.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is the
counteract to woundology.

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make any
sense to reason.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is not something
the mind can pull off.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:90%
It's a mystical act of the soul.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.770 align:middle line:84%
It's something that defies
gravity, it defies reason.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the most unreasonable
thing you will ever do,

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:58.790 align:middle line:84%
because you can't give yourself
a reasonable reason to forgive,

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:06.260 align:middle line:84%
but it is the one thing that
disempowers your wounds.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember, wounds are
powerful social currency,

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and they give you latitude to
indulge the worst part of you

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:84%
Think of them as powerful allies
in weakening you and allowing

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.750 align:middle line:84%
you to be carried on
the back of others

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.390 align:middle line:90%
without shame or embarrassment.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:27.030 align:middle line:84%
If you have an agenda of wanting
someone to carry your weight,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.420 align:middle line:84%
most people won't own
that, therefore they

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.230 align:middle line:84%
have to show up wounded and
expect to be taken care of.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Just like I spoke about
the self-esteem episode,

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.070 align:middle line:84%
you must develop a
reverence for yourself

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.950 align:middle line:84%
and respect for the journey
appealing the wound,

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.680 align:middle line:84%
understanding that
a wound isn't meant

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:90%
to be used as a power object.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:53.720 align:middle line:84%
A wound is a part of
life's natural challenges

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that happened to all of us,
and it's up to all of us

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:84%
to use the wound as a
means to enhance and build

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:90%
our own character.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.840 align:middle line:10%
Getting out of woundology
also takes effort, meaning

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.130 align:middle line:10%
you can't speak wound--

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.230 align:middle line:10%
you can't speak your wound.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:15.230 align:middle line:84%
The opportunities
to use your wound

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:18.230 align:middle line:84%
will come up again
and again, but you

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:23.210 align:middle line:84%
have to catch yourself by
habit, and you have to stop

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:27.650 align:middle line:84%
using your wound when
opportunities come up

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
and you realize, this is
a perfect chance for me

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate, to one-up
someone when someone says,

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:84%
oh, I had this
terrible experience

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and blah, blah, blah,
blah, and how maybe it's

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.010 align:middle line:84%
a classic time
where you would say,

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.900 align:middle line:84%
you think you had
a bad day, while I

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.120 align:middle line:84%
had wor-- you have an
opportunity to perhaps focus

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.530 align:middle line:84%
on something good, an empowering
that happened to you instead

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.540 align:middle line:90%
of something disempowering.

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Now what if you're living
with a woundologist?

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.180 align:middle line:90%
That switches everything around.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Living with a woundologist
is like living

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.740 align:middle line:90%
with a vampire archetype.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can suck the
oxygen out of the room

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:90%
and you know it.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:11.770 align:middle line:10%
One of the most difficult
choices you make

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:10%
is the day you stop responding
to the power of their wounds,

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.170 align:middle line:10%
to the use of their wounds.

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.650 align:middle line:84%
When the martyr says,
do you know how much

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.820 align:middle line:90%
I have suffered for you?

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:84%
It's up to you to be able
to say, I'm sure you have,

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:32.730 align:middle line:90%
but I'm still leaving.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.730 align:middle line:84%
The day that their wound becomes
something you do not respond to

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:50.770 align:middle line:84%
is a huge, huge game-changer for
both you and for that person.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:10%
It takes an enormous
amount of courage

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.190 align:middle line:10%
to make a different
choice when you

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:02.220 align:middle line:10%
are in a relationship
with a woundologist.

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I think personally one of
the most courageous things

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.550 align:middle line:84%
in the world is to
make a choice that

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:14.860 align:middle line:84%
changes the dynamic in a
pattern between two people.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not a simple thing
to do, because you

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
change one pattern, one
choice, and the entire dynamic

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.720 align:middle line:90%
will go in a different way.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Remember, nothing in life
is meant to stay wounded.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
We will always end up getting
wounded one way or another,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:40.500 align:middle line:84%
because we are vulnerable, we're
in packages that wound easily,

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.690 align:middle line:84%
but we're not meant
to stay wounded.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:46.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why we repair
ourself so fast.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.020 align:middle line:84%
That's why the moment
we have the slightest

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.950 align:middle line:84%
injury, everything in our
body runs to that place

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:55.200 align:middle line:90%
to begin to repair it.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a break in
our skin or a broken bone,

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:04.290 align:middle line:84%
everything in our body runs
to repair it so that it is--

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:06.270 align:middle line:90%
it grows back and is replaced.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Nature, the forest, everything,
the ocean, everything

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.470 align:middle line:90%
works to repair.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.380 align:middle line:84%
We're not meant to
dwell in wounds.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most challenging
things about a wound

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84%
is that it morphs our
thinking, and it causes us

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:29.040 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day to
think God made a mistake.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:90%
Heaven made a mistake.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.270 align:middle line:84%
That this shouldn't
have happened to us.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:40.470 align:middle line:10%
And let me say that
sometimes the size of a wound

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:10%
is so extraordinarily
brutal, so horrible.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have
come across people

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
who have been wounded in ways
that take my breath away.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It makes my eyes water when I--

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.590 align:middle line:84%
I have to hold on to my
heart when I listen to them.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.363 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.363 --> 00:27:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And when they talk
to me about it,

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I begin secretly quietly praying
for them as I listen to them.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Because I sometimes
can't believe what

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.340 align:middle line:84%
some-- what human beings have
put other human beings through.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.870 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the
day, the choice we hear

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:24.060 align:middle line:84%
is that we either get
bitter or we get better.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.340 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:84%
The choice isn't that
we sit back and wait

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.290 align:middle line:84%
for some form of explanation
to drop into our lap,

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.320 align:middle line:90%
because that will never happen.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.350 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you,
as a historian, I

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
can tell you as someone who has
been in this business forever,

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.440 align:middle line:90%
that has never happened.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.720 align:middle line:84%
Not even Jesus in the Garden
of Gethsemane somebody

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:54.618 align:middle line:84%
got an answer to why do I have
to do this gig this weekend?

00:27:54.618 --> 00:27:56.530 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We will never have
our wounds explained.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.920 align:middle line:84%
We can only go forward
and say, somehow

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.880 align:middle line:84%
in the grand scheme of things,
we're all in this together.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And nature has designed
one grand thing true--

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.980 align:middle line:84%
we are all meant to
heal, and you will heal.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.190 align:middle line:90%
You will heal.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:84%
That's what you
have to trust is,

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.790 align:middle line:84%
this is a journey
we're all in together.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:25.180 align:middle line:90%
So forward you go.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:28.530 align:middle line:90%
