And one of the great
reasons we suffer

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.810 align:middle line:84%
is because we believe

to Plato and Aristotle.

universe was structured.

Was it more valuable to pursue

What would serve a
person more to know

00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:90%
as they lived in this universe?

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And they debated
this because they

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
were teaching their students
to live in this universe,

One was a more intuitive
path, and the other one

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.770 align:middle line:84%
was more reasonable, as
if, somehow or other,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:84%
there could be found an ultimate
logical, reasonable system

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%

finally, finally, finally deal

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.410 align:middle line:84%

in order to stop sudden chance
from happening in our lives--

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
that we could, somehow or

from happening.

We're going to come into this
through the Old Testament,

my very favorite book,
which is the Book of Job.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
know the story of Job.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.750 align:middle line:10%
You know, the righteous man,
and the devil came up to Yahweh

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:10%
and said, I could tempt
your most righteous man.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:10%
And of course, Yahweh says to
the devil, well, have at it.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:90%
Give it your best shot.

[SOUND OF LIGHTNING]

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So the devil kills Job's
crops, and he starts

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.550 align:middle line:90%
just destroying his life.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.608 align:middle line:84%
And every single time
something bad happens to Job,

00:03:13.608 --> 00:03:15.650 align:middle line:84%
his neighbors would come
over and they would say,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.320 align:middle line:84%
you must have done
something terrible,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.770 align:middle line:84%
otherwise a reasonable god
wouldn't do this to you.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And he'd say, but I
didn't do anything.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.130 align:middle line:90%
I didn't do anything.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And finally, Job's wife
dies, his crops are gone,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:84%
he's lost everything--
absolutely everything.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:10%
But then, of course,
the neighbors

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:10%
want job to confess something
because this is how they've

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.270 align:middle line:10%
structured their universe.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:10%
And if Job didn't
do anything wrong,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:10%
it meant that this whimsical
god could suddenly strike

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.740 align:middle line:10%
something in their life too.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So they had to find Joe
guilty of something, you see.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
So then an angel comes up to Job
and says, maybe it's you, Job.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's your attitude.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Maybe God should talk to you.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:84%
So he says, prepare
to talk to God.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
wonderful line, I

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
think, in the whole
Old Testament,

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
where Yahweh says to
Job, where were you

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
when I laid the foundations
of this universe?

I named the beasts,

birds, and I structured

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:10%
the planets and the galaxies?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.480 align:middle line:84%

who, by this time,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.350 align:middle line:84%
is just this little piece
of sand on a grand beach.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Now, can you imagine--

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.020 align:middle line:10%
as I say to my students, think
of your way saying this to you.

how could this happen to me?

Our love affair with reason
has scaffolded our thinking out

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.560 align:middle line:90%
of the soul and into the mind.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%

way we related to everything,

including our health.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:84%

premise is that if we

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.140 align:middle line:84%

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:90%
is this rarely happens.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.180 align:middle line:84%
We cannot reason our
way back to health.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
You cannot reason with illness
or crisis because crises are

the most unreasonable events
that will ever happen to you.

Well, and with that
in mind, every time--

we say, I need a reason for
why things happen as they do.

Let me tell you something.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.240 align:middle line:10%
Some of the readings I've done--

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.670 align:middle line:10%
not a lot, but some--

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.310 align:middle line:10%
I recognized that a
pattern that I was seeing--

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:10%
let's call it an influencer--

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:13.880 align:middle line:10%
was not from a past life, but
from a life yet to be lived--

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.560 align:middle line:10%
yet to be lived--

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.180 align:middle line:10%
that the reason a person
was having a particular type

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:10%
of challenge was
that it had something

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.240 align:middle line:10%
to do with something yet to
happen in the physical world.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:90%
So that's number one.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a factor that
doesn't even occur to us.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
We are comfortable thinking
in terms of our history,

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.200 align:middle line:84%
but we have yet to even
begin to comprehend.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.910 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a
world of simultaneity,

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.680 align:middle line:90%
but we can't comprehend that.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:84%

terms of, there

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
must be one reason for every
one thing that happens to us.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there is karma, and
there's lives yet to be lived,

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's influences of
other people in our lives.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And if all of
that's true, how can

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
there just be one reason for
why things happen as they do?

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So you see we can't
have things both ways.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And because we can't possibly
comprehend the true reasons

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.799 align:middle line:90%
why things happen as they do--

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:39.799 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you something.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:43.190 align:middle line:10%
The need for a
reason is actually

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:48.760 align:middle line:10%
a psychic weight that prevents
the miraculous from happening.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an example
that defies gravity.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
The college I went to, it
was founded by French nuns

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago in the 1840s.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And the woman who founded
it was, not so long ago,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.226 align:middle line:84%
canonized the eighth
American saint.

00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:12.130 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
So here's the miracle that
got her into sainthood.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.400 align:middle line:90%
This one man was blind.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:90%
He had cataracts over his eyes.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't see
anything except, like,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:90%
5% light coming through.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
He knew about the sisters
praying for this canonization.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.510 align:middle line:84%
On the way back
from an appointment

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:84%
with his ophthalmologist,
he said to his wife,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:90%
would you stop at that church?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.930 align:middle line:90%
And I just want to say a prayer.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:84%
He goes to a painting of
Sister Garen and said,

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
I know you don't know me
and I'm not a Catholic,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
but if you have any influence,
I'd appreciate your help.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:90%
That was his prayer.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
[SIGHS] And the
next day he woke up,

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.010 align:middle line:84%
and the cataracts
were still there,

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.550 align:middle line:84%
but he had 20/20 vision,
which he still has.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And he went to his
ophthalmologist, who said,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:90%
this is impossible.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:90%
This can't happen.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.860 align:middle line:90%
But it did.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Classic miracle speak.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
Here's the thing.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.880 align:middle line:84%
A miracle is something
that's totally beyond reason.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:90%
The nature of God--

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, I'm
going to say this.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I am not politically correct,
and I have no use for that.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.130 align:middle line:84%
So when I say God,
if you need to hear

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Goddess, whatever you need
to hear, throw it in there.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.730 align:middle line:84%
But I say god, and
that's the end of it.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Are we clear?

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:90%
Keep going.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.830 align:middle line:84%
A woman came into
one of my workshops.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.380 align:middle line:84%
She had a slow
growing brain tumor.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And by this time, I was teaching
the work of Teresa of Ávila

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:90%
and "The Interior Castle."

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would lead people
on prayers for healing.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And what I told them, as
I'm going to tell you now--

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and this is the nature
of sacred power,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's the nature of
healing beyond reason--

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:90%
beyond reason.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things about prayer

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is you have to be willing to
let unreasonable things happen

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.010 align:middle line:90%
within you and around you.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And the way of your soul is to
get you to become unreasonable.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that there
is an inherent clash in you

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.610 align:middle line:84%
because you want people
to be reasonable.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.890 align:middle line:90%
You want life to be--

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and it's not
reasonable, controlling.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, when your back is
against the wall with illness,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
the only way out of a terminal
illness, in so many cases,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
is something crazy and
unreasonable, like a miracle.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So here's this woman
in my workshop,

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
and she just said
this prayer, whatever

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
it takes, whatever it
takes, which is really

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:90%
quite an unreasonable prayer.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.310 align:middle line:10%
It means whatever it takes.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.330 align:middle line:10%
She came to a later
workshop of mine.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And she came up to me and she
said, my brain tumor is gone.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want you to know
that I came to your workshop.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And she said it was
spreading, it was malignant,

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and I was given a
few months to live.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And she said, and
I decided I'm going

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
to give the most
unreasonable prayer ever,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:90%
which is whatever it takes.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, in that
moment, she said

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.543 align:middle line:90%
I felt grace comes through.

00:12:46.543 --> 00:12:48.910 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:84%
You may think that miracles
or these extraordinary things

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
happen to extraordinary
people, but I have

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:90%
to tell you that is not true.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to make
the choice to become

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:03.820 align:middle line:90%
spiritually unreasonable--

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:90%
absolutely unreasonable.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.630 align:middle line:84%
It begins with a deep
journey into yourself.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.780 align:middle line:84%
This is a trick that I get
people to do in my workshop.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
You need to get
to know yourself,

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:84%
but in ways that
perhaps show you

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.650 align:middle line:84%
something to make
you uncomfortable,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:90%
but it's a good uncomfortable.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.290 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you get how many
rules you have about yourself.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
you're going to do

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.050 align:middle line:84%
is something that is
incredibly unreasonable.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.030 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
create a rule book.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
unreasonable thing to do,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
but people have
rules for themselves

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
because they want life to be
reasonable and controlling.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we create rules,
all kinds of rules.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
We have a list of needs
that go from here to there.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.510 align:middle line:90%
This is what I need to eat.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.330 align:middle line:84%
This is how I need
to be spoken to.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, Julie
needs to have you look

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:90%
at her every time she speaks.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And Jack needs quiet
time past 8:00 PM.

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.900 align:middle line:90%
And Laura?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
She needs to win every
argument she engages in.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.860 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
I do in my workshops

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:10%
is I have people write
out their rule books.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.540 align:middle line:84%
This is the tone of
voice you need to use.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You can't use (HIGHER
PITCH) this tone of voice,

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.142 align:middle line:84%
but you can use (LOWER
PITCH) this tone of voice.

00:14:25.142 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And what the point
of this workshop is

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
is that you've made
up all these rules.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:90%
They're all subjective.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.610 align:middle line:84%
You've decided these
are the rules of my life

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that everybody has to follow
in order to get along with me.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:90%
I need this much attention.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:90%
I need this kind of food.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.860 align:middle line:90%
I said to someone else, or what?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly or what?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:90%
Or I won't be happy.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll be angry.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.230 align:middle line:90%
And then what?

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.620 align:middle line:84%
So here's the thing I want
you to do your rulebook.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.920 align:middle line:84%
Because what I have people do
in my workshops is, once they

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.390 align:middle line:84%
create their rulebook, I have
them introduce themselves

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.540 align:middle line:84%
to someone they've never
met before, and hand over

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.550 align:middle line:84%
the rulebook, and
say, hi, there.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.380 align:middle line:84%
My name is Kathy, or, my name
is Linda, or, my name is Tom,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.780 align:middle line:84%
and here are the rules
you need to know in order

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:90%
to get to know me.

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
It is an experience of your
ego, and how frightened

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
you are to have your
world be out of control,

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and what you will do to control
others before they control you.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:90%
It's a very humbling exercise.

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a first step of getting
to know how afraid you

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:90%
are of letting go.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:10%
This is about you
learning to defy gravity.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.210 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do I mean
by defying gravity?

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Gravity is
weightlessness, right?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
But here's something
else about gravity.

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Gravity, the root
of it is gravitas--

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:90%
gravitas-- which is weight.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know what I learned
as a medical intuitive?

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:84%
When you attach to
something energetically,

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:90%
you give it weight.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:90%
You give it energetic weight.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And when you give
something weight--

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:41.450 align:middle line:84%
W-E-I-G-H-T-- you actually
attach a relationship to time.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:47.060 align:middle line:84%
The more weight you give, the
longer you have to W-A-I-T

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:90%
for everything.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.830 align:middle line:90%
So weight-- W-E-I-G-H-T--

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:90%
equals an anchor.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you create
anchors for yourself,

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.310 align:middle line:84%
you're literally creating
ways that are going

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:03.110 align:middle line:90%
to take you to the grave--

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:90%
gravitas.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
And this is why Buddha
would always say,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:10.910 align:middle line:84%
you have to spot these illusions
and not attach yourself.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:84%
You're deciding, that
person broke my rules.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.380 align:middle line:84%
He said something,
she said something,

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.010 align:middle line:84%
and I'm now deciding to
take that personally.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
How many times in my life
I have gotten off a stage

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.715 align:middle line:84%
after lecturing for hours,
and hours, and hours,

00:17:25.715 --> 00:17:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and I've been so tired,
and I've wanted to go back.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And someone has said,
could I just talked to you

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.350 align:middle line:90%
for a moment?

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
have been lecturing

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:40.590 align:middle line:84%
for fruits 17,000 hours,
and I just want to go away.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd say, excuse me,
but I need to just leave here.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:10%
And they've taken my
exhaustion personally,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.480 align:middle line:10%
as if it had anything
to do with them.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:18:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things about
you beginning to lighten up

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:09.700 align:middle line:84%
and becoming a free-floating
field is that you decide,

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.920 align:middle line:90%
this is not a personal universe.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an impersonal universe.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.470 align:middle line:84%
I have to stop taking
things personally.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:90%
Think of Job.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:84%
This universe was not
created personally.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be more
irrational a thought than

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.128 align:middle line:84%
to think this universe
was created for me.

00:18:31.128 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:10%
Everybody I know
either knows somebody

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:10%
or has a family member
that is connected

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.290 align:middle line:10%
to Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.720 align:middle line:10%
One of the blessings
of Alcoholics Anonymous

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:10%
is that Bill Wilson's program
made the study of addiction

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.960 align:middle line:10%
impersonal--

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:10%
totally impersonal.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
He introduced the
addict and addiction

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:84%
as an impersonal struggle
that people personally, then,

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.990 align:middle line:90%
related to.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.530 align:middle line:84%
So he created this
duality that addiction

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:11.030 align:middle line:84%
was, at the same time,
an impersonal while

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.810 align:middle line:90%
being personal.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.740 align:middle line:84%
And he identified the
archetype of the addict.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, he
allowed the individual

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
to separate from the
pattern of addiction

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.040 align:middle line:84%
and said, addicts
behave this way.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And so people I know
who are part of AA who

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.410 align:middle line:84%
have had that will
say, here's the person

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:90%
I love, and there's the disease.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:37.100 align:middle line:84%
The impersonal and the
personal, but the disease

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:90%
behaves this way.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And because of that, millions
and millions of lives

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:46.940 align:middle line:84%
have been saved,
and love prevails.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And that is the mentality
that I'm talking about.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.350 align:middle line:10%
So in that same way,
we're going to talk

00:19:54.350 --> 00:20:00.950 align:middle line:10%
about how is it that
we learn to approach

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:06.290 align:middle line:10%
the universe in a way that
allows you to see grace

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.360 align:middle line:10%
in action in a universe that
is both totally impersonal

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.450 align:middle line:10%
and personal simultaneously--

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.200 align:middle line:10%
that it is a place
where the ordinary

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.340 align:middle line:10%
happens among the
extraordinary all the time?

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:90%
But the thing is a miracle--

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.330 align:middle line:90%
a miracle.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
The reason I kind
of balk at that word

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.340 align:middle line:84%
is because a miracle is for
the spiritually, how do I say,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:90%
amateurs--

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:84%
for people who don't
get how God works.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.010 align:middle line:10%
If you think of
miracles as ordinary,

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:10%
then they're not miracles.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.970 align:middle line:84%
They're just the nature
of God in everyday action

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:58.100 align:middle line:84%
in a world that
functions on faith.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, think about your
world functioning that way.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I'm
going to suggest you try.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
My suggestions for
people is that they

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.070 align:middle line:84%
detach from their
preexisting image

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:90%
of God as a off-planet man.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.120 align:middle line:90%
We've anthropomorphized god.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.730 align:middle line:84%
And while I can't explain
it in full measure,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
I could snap my
fingers and say, I

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.242 align:middle line:84%
want you to look
up in the heavens

00:21:24.242 --> 00:21:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and see what's
happening is there's

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.227 align:middle line:84%
a collision of the
gods going on--

00:21:28.227 --> 00:21:29.510 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.130 align:middle line:90%
--of all the Abrahamic gods--

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
of Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And they're all going kaboom
in the heavens right now--

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:90%
[KABOOM]

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:84%
--because the heaven is
closing down the holy man

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.080 align:middle line:90%
God archetype.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.170 align:middle line:84%
It's served us, but
now we're moving

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:84%
into the era of
galactic theology.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Even now, as, I'm
talking to you in Rome

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.510 align:middle line:84%
there's a gathering
of theologians,

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
and astrophysicists, and
astrobiologists trying

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:90%
to script a galactic theology--

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.370 align:middle line:84%
a God that is larger than
our image of ourselves

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:90%
on this planet.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.430 align:middle line:84%
Give up the need to know why
things happen as they do.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Start being spiritually
irrational--

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:90%
irrational.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, tell
me why this happened,

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.520 align:middle line:84%
remind yourself that you're a
grain of sand in a huge ocean,

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and just say, help
me learn from this.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.320 align:middle line:84%
Connect with
meaning and purpose.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Don't expect meaning and purpose
to be delivered to your door

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.570 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
happen that way.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
You bring meaning and
purpose to everything.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.660 align:middle line:90%
Every word is power.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Words are power.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:84%
Watch how you frame
your universe.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And don't pray like
an ordinary mortal.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Prayers are not meant to
be petitions like you're

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.300 align:middle line:90%
talking to Santa Claus.

00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Can I have?

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.660 align:middle line:90%
Can I have more stuff?

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Don't pray like a stuffologist.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Pray like you have
respect for the sacred.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.130 align:middle line:90%
And you pray with your soul.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:10%
Open me up.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:10%
Open me up.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.940 align:middle line:10%
Take me down deep, and
show me the reasons

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:10%
you gave me this life, and give
me the candle on the night.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.490 align:middle line:90%
You're going to suffer.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.840 align:middle line:90%
That's life.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
And you pray that you have the
courage not to betray people,

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:90%
in yourself.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.140 align:middle line:90%
Make me courageous.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:90%
Make me integrous.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:90%
Make me merciful.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.470 align:middle line:90%
That's how you pray.

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.595 align:middle line:90%
And pray like you're crazy.

00:23:42.595 --> 00:23:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Pray like you're a
wild person like I do.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Pray like you expect
an answer, like heaven

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.260 align:middle line:90%
really is listening to you.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.460 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.
