>> We are intuitively
wired to help each other,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.590 align:middle line:84%
to sense each other's
vulnerability and to respond

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.980 align:middle line:90%
to that.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.550 align:middle line:84%
So an invisible act of power
is what our intuitive system

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:90%
is designed to respond to.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.570 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing
up Roman Catholic,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I learned to be
spiritually bilingual.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And by that, I mean I spoke
English and angels and miracles

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.290 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, which wasn't
unusual for Catholics my age.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:84%
Except in that
generation, it was normal.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:10%
And I learned that miracles
could happen every day.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.069 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, they do.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:10%
And for several of us
children, angels and saints

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:10%
were actually our first
encounter with invisible power.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.997 align:middle line:84%
We prayed to them
and they answered us.

00:01:13.997 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they really answered us.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Not like showing up
at our door, but we

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:84%
expected them to answer
us, and we grew up

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:90%
knowing we were never alone.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, there was so
much comfort in that.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way
angels and saints

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.500 align:middle line:84%
were presented to us were
as these holy guardians

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.010 align:middle line:90%
of the world we lived in.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
It was as if they were
these guardians of us

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.000 align:middle line:90%
for safe keeping.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that faith
is an active force, not

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:90%
a passive one.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.420 align:middle line:84%
It was an invisible
power, like love.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not simply a
belief in goodness,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
it's a belief that needed
to be put into action

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's been my experience
that more people today

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
have faith in what
they don't believe in.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
They can tell me
with great conviction

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.750 align:middle line:84%
what they don't believe in
than what they do believe in.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
But faith is that
incredible capacity

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
to have a sense that there's
something much greater than you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that governs this
great universe.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And all timeless faiths share
this same expression of faith.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.070 align:middle line:84%
When I was in India, someone
said to me, it's so nice of you

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.910 align:middle line:90%
to come visit here.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.490 align:middle line:84%
We have so many gods,
and you just have one.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.710 align:middle line:90%
So help yourself.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Bali,
I noticed that people

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.950 align:middle line:84%
had their altars of
devotion at their homes

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.020 align:middle line:90%
that they honored every morning.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Tibet has the prayer flags.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a nation covered with God.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:90%
God is everywhere.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And the invisible world
just isn't around us,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.880 align:middle line:90%
it's within us.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
We are intuitively wired
to sense each other.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.690 align:middle line:84%
But in particular,
in particular,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
we are wired to sense the
fragility and the vulnerability

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.960 align:middle line:84%
of our fellow human
beings, just as we're

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
wired to sense intuitively
our own energy field.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Odd as it may seem, I believe
that this acute inner sense

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
of how we can sense each
other's vulnerability also

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
explains why we can be
so cruel and uncaring.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So I need to explain
that, because that

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
could hit some people like
a brick between the eyes.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I noticed this a lot, but then
one day, it made sense to me.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:84%
I have a particular
devotion to homeless people.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
By that I mean that's
my particular charity.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
So I pay attention to people
who walk past homeless people

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.310 align:middle line:90%
in an uncaring way.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:90%
How much is a quarter?

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:90%
How much is a dime?

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:90%
How much is a nickel?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
Do you know how difficult
it is to sit on the ground

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and look up at another
person and ask for money?

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and try it.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Put yourself on a
sidewalk and look up

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
at a human being walking
past you and ask for a dime.

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
You want to be humbled?

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.150 align:middle line:90%
That will do it.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So what I realized this one day
as I was sitting there watching

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and counting how many
people walked by,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.110 align:middle line:84%
and not just walked
by, but avoided.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I knew was, in order
to avoid, they had to feel.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They felt the pain
in that person.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.050 align:middle line:84%
They actually felt
the vulnerability

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:90%
in that human being.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:90%
So it was a choice.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.740 align:middle line:90%
It was a choice.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.490 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And the hostility of saying,
I bet, I bet that person

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:84%
has more money than me or
has a lot of money at home,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and why don't they get
a job, and that kind

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
of vulgar hostility toward
these vulnerable people

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
was a response not
to those people,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
but to their intuitive capacity
to sense the vulnerability

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in those people that they
had to numb themselves,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.400 align:middle line:84%
because their intuition,
their intuitive wiring

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
could sense the vulnerability,
and they were feeling compelled

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:84%
to reach out, and
they didn't want

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:18.130 align:middle line:84%
to open that faucet any bigger
than it was already open.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.201 align:middle line:90%
They wanted to close it.

00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:22.606 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
You know, when they
say in the Army

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.050 align:middle line:84%
that they train people to
see the enemy as animals

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.460 align:middle line:84%
because they can't afford to
have that sensitivity open up

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.200 align:middle line:90%
or they couldn't be soldiers.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:90%
They couldn't be soldiers.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
They can't see them
as human beings.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So you have to create
in their way a way

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
to turn down that
humanity, because we

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
are wired to see the
humanity in each other.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:59.110 align:middle line:84%
The goal of consciousness
is to open ourselves up

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
to each other, not
just to ourselves.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.100 align:middle line:84%

a course in life where you'll
never make any mistakes.

No.

You intuitive skill,
your intuitive skill

is about you awakening to
the senses of your soul.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.430 align:middle line:90%
Your soul.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And this may come as a shock,
but your soul is not about you.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Your soul is the

is that all life
breathes together.

consciousness is to become

conscious of your
place in this universe

Isn't that a great question?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:90%
What is grace?

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.650 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea how many

stuff?

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:90%
Does it make things better?

No.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:90%
Here's a great example of grace.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Every one of you has
been in a situation

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.080 align:middle line:84%
where you're in

with someone, big, huge.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:90%
You want to win.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.030 align:middle line:90%
You want to win bad.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
that one remark up

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:05.690 align:middle line:84%
your sleeve that's like
the bad ace up your sleeve.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.910 align:middle line:84%
You could say this,
and you know it's

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:84%
going to hurt that person so bad
it could be the deal breaker.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.010 align:middle line:84%
You could bring up maybe
a past thing they did.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.080 align:middle line:90%
Remember when you cheated on me?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.850 align:middle line:84%
Remember when you-- or
something really horrible,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.350 align:middle line:84%
the thing that you know
would crush the person.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:90%
And then you hear that voice.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.772 align:middle line:84%
And that voice says, are you
sure you want to say that?

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are you sure
you want to do that?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do, you
know what, it's bad.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure you
can piece this together.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
that voice kicks in.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And instead of you pulling that
awful ace out of your sleeve,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
instead, you decide,
oh, the hell with this,

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:90%
and you walk out.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.980 align:middle line:84%
You just storm out of there,
only to say to yourself later,

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.220 align:middle line:90%
thank God I did that.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.700 align:middle line:90%
What made me walk out?

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
You may not say to
yourself that was grace,

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
because maybe that word's not
part of your inner parlance.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:84%
But it should be, and it's going
to be after you watch this.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.170 align:middle line:84%
Because spending
time with me is what

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:84%
learning this is all
about, sacred power

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.770 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful the sacred
is, and that acts of grace

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:90%
happen all the time.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways
grace works is it

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:39.190 align:middle line:84%
saves us from our worst
instincts, our worst instincts.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And another way it works is
that it gives us opportunities

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
to act on behalf of
others, to be there,

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to be the tools of the
invisible world in the visible,

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.930 align:middle line:84%
to be the hands of
heaven on Earth.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Think about that, to be the
hands of heaven on Earth.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
When I was in school,
the nuns used to say,

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.310 align:middle line:84%
sometimes angels walk in
disguise on the Earth.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think sometimes,
they would say that to us

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
so that we would
behave ourselves

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.070 align:middle line:90%
when they weren't around.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.710 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Angels walk the
Earth in disguise.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.140 align:middle line:90%
They absolutely do.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.280 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of proof for
things I cannot prove.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:84%
That in fact, the
invisible world

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
is visible in so many ways
if you know how to see it,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
if you know how to look, if
you know how to break the code.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You have to be willing to
surrender to divine guidance.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.580 align:middle line:84%
There is a reason why all
the religions of the world

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.090 align:middle line:90%
teach surrender.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.420 align:middle line:84%
In the Alcoholics
Anonymous program,

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:08.430 align:middle line:84%
surrender really was
introduced, and in a big way.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.560 align:middle line:84%
So it got a
reputation of meaning,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.320 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I give up because
everything has failed,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.457 align:middle line:90%
everything around me.

00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:15.290 align:middle line:90%
Look what I've done.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.410 align:middle line:90%
I've blown everything.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And so that's like one way
to understand surrender.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's very valid.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very valid.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, you blow
it, because you just do.

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:84%
Our ordinary
understanding of surrender

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:84%
is that we have bottomed out
or failed in every possible way

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.550 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And we avoid that
moment of surrender

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:84%
because it is an admission
that we've run out

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:90%
of options to help ourselves.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.300 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
mystical surrender.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I wanted to
address here, sacred surrender.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So pay attention because
this is a big huge jewel

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm giving you.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.316 align:middle line:84%
Sacred surrender
is when you get--

00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
when you get deep in your
soul-- wait a minute.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
I have to pull myself
together, because this is big.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.870 align:middle line:90%
All right, hold it.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Sacred surrender is when you
get how powerful you are.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Not how unpowerful, but
how powerful you are.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
What an incredibly powerful
instrument you really

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
are that every
thought you have is,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
in fact, a tool of creation,
that every prayer you say

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:90%
is, in fact, heard.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.380 align:middle line:84%
If you can get
over your own fear

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that what I'm
telling you is true,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's a big sentence
I just leveled at you, then

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.180 align:middle line:84%
what you have to contend
with is that maybe what

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you is the
truth, that maybe you

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
are that powerful, which means
that the rules of your life

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.580 align:middle line:90%
have to change.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.600 align:middle line:90%
They have to change.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you get
that you really are

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.240 align:middle line:84%
a powerful instrument
of the sacred,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.460 align:middle line:84%
that means everybody
else is too.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not about you.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It means every human
being is the same way.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.610 align:middle line:90%
And I have to tell you--

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to tell you something.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.980 align:middle line:84%
That didn't strike me as
good news when I realized it.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Because let's face it, this
is what spirituality is about.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:39.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to up the bar and
decide I have to work at this.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But then you have
to realize what does

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:90%
this mean for helping others?

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.790 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean
for the guidance

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:51.270 align:middle line:84%
that I hear that I
have to surrender to?

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.030 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean for that?

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:84%
It means that when
you're told something,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and you're given
a gut instruction,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.950 align:middle line:84%
you don't pause
and say, you know

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.990 align:middle line:84%
what, I'm afraid that
doesn't make any sense to me.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:11.242 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make sense and I'm
not going to do it, so there.

00:15:11.242 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It means this is how the
mystical world works.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is how heaven works.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:84%
What you're told is never
going to make sense to you,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:90%
and that's the way heaven works.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:28.320 align:middle line:84%
All mystical instruction
is going to baffle you.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
If fact, if I wrote a
book on how heaven talks,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.120 align:middle line:84%
it would begin with, it will
never make sense to you.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.412 align:middle line:84%
Because it always relies
upon you surrendering to--

00:15:40.412 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea how
this is going to work,

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to do it.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Because if left to you,
you would mess it up

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
with your ego projection, your
expectation, and your need

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.580 align:middle line:90%
to get the attention.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Which is why when heaven
is giving you instructions,

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.190 align:middle line:84%
you'll never know what step two
is until you get to step two

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.780 align:middle line:90%
so that you don't mess it up.

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, the journey to
empowerment, oftentimes we

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:84%
think of this spiritual journey
only in terms of ourself.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
My spiritual journey,
my spiritual journey.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:29.890 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell you that this
spiritual journey is about how

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:84%
we become something
greater than ourselves

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of everybody
else, on behalf

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.880 align:middle line:84%
of making the human journey
a much better place,

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.110 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of sensing
how we can serve

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.950 align:middle line:84%
the whole with all that
we are and all that we

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.570 align:middle line:90%
have to give to the whole.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:00.770 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual path is not about
what we can take from life,

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.210 align:middle line:84%
but how we become an
instrument of transforming

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the whole of life on
behalf of everyone else.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual
journey inside of you

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:18.780 align:middle line:84%
is going to make you more
attuned to the world around you

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
because your intuitive,
your inner senses

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.300 align:middle line:90%
are going to awaken.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
awaken so that you

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:31.310 align:middle line:90%
can figure out how not to fail.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:middle line:84%
They awaken so
that you can begin

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.130 align:middle line:84%
the journey of self-discovery
about yourself,

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:84%
your inner nature,
who you really are,

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:50.460 align:middle line:84%
what really drives you,
so that you can truly

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:84%
respond to the needs of
others and to your own deeper

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.080 align:middle line:90%
potential as a soul.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
So I want to discuss invisible
facts about invisible power,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.640 align:middle line:90%
and specifically, sacred power.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
You may not think about sacred
power or power as sacred,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.970 align:middle line:84%
but actually, this
is a big jewel

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.990 align:middle line:90%
to put into your jewel pouch.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Sacred power is what we aspire
to on the spiritual journey,

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:84%
the acquisition and
the development,

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:36.490 align:middle line:84%
the inner development of
sacred inner authority.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And sacred power, what
do I mean by that?

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:90%
Think about healing.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.630 align:middle line:90%
What does it take to heal?

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
If you just put your
hands on someone,

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.550 align:middle line:84%
nothing's going to
happen as a rule.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they'll feel a little bit.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they'll
relax a little bit.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
But the chances that an
illness is really going to heal

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.090 align:middle line:90%
is not likely.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:90%
It's not likely.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But could a person actually
heal from someone touching them?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And the answer there is yes.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:90%
I have witnessed that.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:84%
As we blend our inner path with
prayer and faith and trust,

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.560 align:middle line:84%
the quality of power
that comes through us

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:90%
becomes more refined.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens
is that we become

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
capable of generating
and becoming

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:44.010 align:middle line:84%
a source of creating experiences
that we no longer doubt.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is a miracle?

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, a
miracle is something

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
that happens as a
result of sacred power.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:84%
We call something a
miracle because it's

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.280 align:middle line:84%
like a healing that
happens instantly.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.890 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
happens without time.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
It happens out of the
flow of ordinary time.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wondered for
years, why doesn't healing

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:90%
happen at that speed?

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And while I could actually talk
about this for a long time,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.670 align:middle line:84%
because it's fascinating,
I'll cut to the chase.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Healing at the speed
of sacred power

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.870 align:middle line:84%
would happen to
a lot more people

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
except that they
could not withstand

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:84%
the consequence of something
happening at that speed

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.630 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:42.860 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.630 align:middle line:90%
But it's true.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:49.200 align:middle line:84%
They could not handle the
speed of sacred power.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:84%
The force of it requires that we
develop faith in the existence

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and cooperation and partnership
with the invisible world,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:06.750 align:middle line:84%
the capacity to partner with
the invisible world happens.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Sacred power inspires you
to empower others, not

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:90%
disempower them.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:84%
The more you give, the
more is given to you.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.910 align:middle line:84%
You no longer have this fear
that if you empower others,

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.780 align:middle line:90%
what will be left for you?

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, more power
pours into you.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Sacred power is an active
agent of transformation.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.270 align:middle line:84%
You're not driven by greed,
but rather this understanding

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that a rising tide
lifts all ships,

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:84%
and that the more you help the
tide and others lift, the more

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
everyone, all humanity
benefits, because what is in one

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.850 align:middle line:90%
is in the whole.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:57.160 align:middle line:84%
We are meant to treat each other
the same way heaven interacts

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.540 align:middle line:90%
with us.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
I just have to
share some stories,

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.055 align:middle line:90%
because that is the way it is.

00:22:04.055 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:90%
This is one of my favorite.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.480 align:middle line:84%
This is from "Invisible
Acts of Power."

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So this man decides one night
to drive his motorcycle late

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's wintertime, and he
thinks, what a stupid thing

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.930 align:middle line:90%
to do, but I can't help it.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:18.835 align:middle line:90%
I want to do it.

00:22:18.835 --> 00:22:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And he's driving on this road
and he gets into black ice,

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and the motorcycle slides
out because he hits a deer.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.660 align:middle line:84%
He said he saw the ice coming
right out of the woods.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't stop his
motorcycle, it was on ice,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:90%
and he hits the deer.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
He goes flying off
the motorcycle,

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:84%
breaks both his legs,
and the deer's dead.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And he's lying there on this
road in the country just

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:84%
as the road bends, and he
thinks he's going to die,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:84%
because a car's going
to come around the bend

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and he won't be able to
stop because the ice,

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
and he's going to
now get smashed.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.610 align:middle line:84%
He's imagining that that's
going to be his end,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:90%
so he starts praying.

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:10.812 align:middle line:84%
And he hears footsteps
on this frozen snow,

00:23:10.812 --> 00:23:12.520 align:middle line:84%
but he can't see
anything because there's

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:90%
blood in his eyes.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And a woman grabs his head
and puts his head in her lap

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.060 align:middle line:90%
and says, don't worry.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.130 align:middle line:90%
There's an ambulance on its way.

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.450 align:middle line:84%
He assumes she
called the ambulance.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, this
ambulance shows up.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And they said they happened
to be just driving.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.170 align:middle line:90%
No, nobody called.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And no, there aren't
any footsteps.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And no, there isn't any woman.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that
that was his angel.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that
changed his whole life.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of so
many, many endless stories.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.960 align:middle line:84%
A man said to me, I was
going to kill myself.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:02.850 align:middle line:90%
I was going home.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm standing on
the street corner.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm deciding, do I slit my
wrist or do I OD on pills?

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.860 align:middle line:84%
I don't have enough pills, maybe
I should slit my wrists first.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:90%
And he's debating.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:90%
He's having this debate.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:18.435 align:middle line:84%
And he's standing there,
and a car rolls up,

00:24:18.435 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and he looks at the
woman who's driving

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and he just motions for
her, go, go, you go.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And she looks at him,
and instead, she's

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:30.530 align:middle line:84%
flashes this smile at
him, and in that smile,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.800 align:middle line:84%
he decides to live because
of the way she smiled.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.770 align:middle line:84%
An invisible act as
subtle as a smile.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Or was she an angel
who just showed up

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.985 align:middle line:84%
in the car in a second enough
to say, no, no, no, no, live.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:47.785 align:middle line:90%
Live.

00:24:47.785 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.610 align:middle line:90%
That is God in the streets.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:90%
That's angels in the street.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:05.880 align:middle line:84%
That's how important every life
is, even in our darkest moment.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.300 align:middle line:90%
Even in our darkest moment.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.810 align:middle line:84%
These invisible acts of power
happen everywhere all the time.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And here's what you
need to understand.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:25.830 align:middle line:84%
We are wired to respond to each
other in the same delicate way

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.660 align:middle line:90%
that heaven responds to us.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It is one huge,
breathing apparatus.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.700 align:middle line:90%


00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.910 align:middle line:84%
We breathe together
with heaven all the time

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.620 align:middle line:90%
and every prayer is heard.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Every single prayer and
every action is known.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And while I cannot prove that,
there is not one part of me

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:90%
that doubts it.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And if your world feels better
with doubt, you go right ahead.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:84%
But I have to tell
you something,

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.070 align:middle line:90%
try believing it for a week.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And when something
wonderful happens,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.590 align:middle line:84%
don't tell yourself
it's a coincidence.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Use the right language.

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Tell yourself, it's grace.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:90%
