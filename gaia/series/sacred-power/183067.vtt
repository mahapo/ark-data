00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> How do we create a reality?

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.860 align:middle line:84%
What are the tools that
your words, your vocabulary,

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.270 align:middle line:84%
the way you see things, the
way you construct something?

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Every single word
contains a universe.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:84%
But I recognize that
some people's vocabulary

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:84%
lacked words powerful
enough to help them heal.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>> We've talked a lot
about power in this series.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's a reason for that
because everything in life

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:84%
is on a power
calculus, whether it's

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.720 align:middle line:84%
physical power or emotional
power, sexual power

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual power
or creative power.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't matter.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
We want to know,
will this empower me?

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.660 align:middle line:84%
Or will this situation
disempower me?

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:84%
Will this conversation
empower me?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Everything you do, whether
you're conscious about it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:84%
or not, is calculated
by a power factor.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Inevitably, the
answer comes down

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
to the words that
were spoken to you.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.820 align:middle line:90%
It's the power of your words.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
You listen to what
someone will say to you,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.030 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to
phrase something,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:84%
what the tone of
the words they use--

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
everything is done
according to words.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.830 align:middle line:84%
As a wordsmith and a writer of
dozens of articles and books,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
I've always paid
attention to words.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.250 align:middle line:10%
I love words.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.060 align:middle line:90%
Honestly, I used to sleep--

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.130 align:middle line:90%
in fact, I still do--

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
with a dictionary
on my nightstand.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:90%
And I would read words.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I'd think
to myself, this new word--

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and I can't wait to
use this new word--

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
it's a word I
never heard before,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
and how that word
would change my world.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And this love of
words was probably

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.480 align:middle line:84%
one of the greatest
assets in healing

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
because I listened
to what and how

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.180 align:middle line:84%
people phrase their universe,
how they explain themselves

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.230 align:middle line:90%
with the words they use.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:84%
And I realized into my work
that a healing vocabulary

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:84%
is actually a
requirement for healing.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.560 align:middle line:84%
That is, how we think, how
you construct a thought, what

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
we tell ourselves,
what we believe,

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.240 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts we dwell
in can be dealbreakers.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:84%
And what seems
extraordinary to me

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.830 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that many people
lack a healing vocabulary.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
While they may, for example,
speak about the need

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to forgive, they
use the language

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
of anger or of retaliating to
hurt the people they resent.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And in the process,
they hurt themselves.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
They continually
choose words that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:90%
aren't problem solving words.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:84%
People will use phrases such
as, I don't deserve this,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
or, I've always
been a good person.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen to me?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Or, this is not my
fault. I blame my divorce

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.570 align:middle line:90%
for this illness.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
So intensely negative
are the words

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:84%
they use that they serve only
to reinforce their illness.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And all the while, they
think they're healing.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
But healing requires
a positive vocabulary

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.240 align:middle line:84%
that helps you to
reframe even the most

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.680 align:middle line:84%
frightening circumstances that
you might find yourself in.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Consider this.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.400 align:middle line:84%
We give our word or
we break our word.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And either way
shatters or creates

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:90%
an entirely different universe.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the
power of your words.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure how
many people actually

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
ever pause to think about,
what's the power of the word

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:90%
that I'm using?

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to share a story
because I love this story.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.769 align:middle line:84%
These are the stories
that have shaped my world.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And one day I was at a
dinner party in England

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:90%
with very dear friends of mine.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And they had a guest
named Sister Jolenta.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:90%
She changed my life.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And she was talking
about an email

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.550 align:middle line:90%
that she got from a bishop.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
How have times changed
about nuns getting emails

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:90%
from bishops?

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:90%
And that alone was fun.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
She said she got this email,
and she had to respond.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And he was getting
impatient with her

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.460 align:middle line:84%
because she wasn't
responding fast enough.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.363 align:middle line:90%
And so she sent him an email.

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And as she was telling
this story to us,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
she said, well, you know,
I thought to myself,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
he had all this time
to reflect on the words

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:90%
that he put down to me.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
to myself, he's

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:84%
not giving me enough
time to reflect

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
on the words I wanted
to send to him.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And then she said
to us, and you know,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.970 align:middle line:84%
I had to take into consideration
how the words I would use

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
would impact all the people
I was responsible for.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
She was going to reflect on how
every word she had to choose

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.990 align:middle line:84%
was going to impact
the lives of everyone

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:90%
she was responsible for.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So every word was
a universe for her.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That conversation that
night was one of the richest

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:90%
ones I'd ever had in my life.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.280 align:middle line:84%
So rich that I took the word
reflection, a word that I knew

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.460 align:middle line:84%
I had not used much in my
world, and I decided right then

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
it would become a
pivotal word in my life.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.890 align:middle line:10%
And I named my online class
Reflections in her honor

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:10%
because I realized I did not
spend time in reflection.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:84%
If you take that one
word out of your life,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:84%
that you do not reflect on
the quality of the words

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
that you use, the quality of
the actions in your life--

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.430 align:middle line:84%
if that one word is
missing, consider

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
the shape of your inner life
because that one word is not

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:90%
How powerful that one word is.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.480 align:middle line:90%
How powerful every word is.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.040 align:middle line:90%
Think of the book of Genesis.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:90%
In the beginning was the word.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
So what does it mean to
give your word to someone?

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.020 align:middle line:84%
How much of the scar
tissue you carry,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
or how much of the
resentment you carry

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
is because of a word
someone used that you

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:90%
feel you can't get over?

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, in my history was
healing, in my history

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:84%
with people in
workshops, for example,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
or in dealing with illness or in
dealing with emotional trauma,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
the source of the
trauma often comes down

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.830 align:middle line:90%
to what was said to someone.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I was told when I was
younger that I would never

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.840 align:middle line:84%
amount to anything or that
I was a horrible person.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:46.480 align:middle line:84%
A handful of words had the
power to traumatize someone

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.190 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of their life.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
Or conversely, the words that
were never said to somebody--

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:59.950 align:middle line:84%
I was never told that
I was loved enough--

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
words that were
missing in your life.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.590 align:middle line:84%
How is it that we even know each
other except through the words

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
that we exchange with each
other and what it means

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:90%
to give our word to each other?

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
There was a time
in our society when

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:84%
giving your word to someone
was enough to seal a contract.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.140 align:middle line:90%
But I gave them my word.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
A word was enough to seal
a bond, a partnership,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.340 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of your life.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, today we need
lawyers, we need contracts,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.429 align:middle line:84%
we need signatures,
we need all of this

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
think of our word

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:90%
as having that kind of clout.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.450 align:middle line:90%
But we should.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:90%
And you know why we should?

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:90%
This is the irony.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:90%
This is the paradox of it.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:09:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Just when we are beginning to
realize that thoughts create

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:84%
form, that thoughts
create our health,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.200 align:middle line:84%
that thoughts create
our world, this

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:14.340 align:middle line:84%
is when, in fact, we should
absolutely look at the power

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.780 align:middle line:84%
that every word has that
we say to each other.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.750 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
What words wander on their own
through your mind and heart?

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.740 align:middle line:84%
What words just carry
on in their own way

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and then talk to
you on their own

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:84%
all day long and set up
your reality for you?

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.560 align:middle line:84%
What words have
authority over you

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.960 align:middle line:84%
that actually shouldn't have
any authority over you at all?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.200 align:middle line:90%
Things like this.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm just no good at this.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm just no good at this.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:90%
I will fail at this.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.510 align:middle line:90%
I can't try.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:84%
These are words
that talk to you.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
They have no validity,
none whatsoever.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
But they stop you from
becoming everything

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.530 align:middle line:90%
you could possibly be.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Here's another thing.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.030 align:middle line:84%
This is something I figured
out, and it's the truth.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.450 align:middle line:84%
The more powerless a
person is, the more they're

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
going to shrink their world down
to the smallest word, the word

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Watch how this works.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.290 align:middle line:84%
When a person's world becomes
powerless on the outside,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:84%
that person will refer
to the only power

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.645 align:middle line:84%
they have on the inside,
which is the power to say no.

00:10:40.645 --> 00:10:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say, do
you want to do this?

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to try this?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.597 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:45.597 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:90%
Would you want to go here?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.600 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So they'll cling to
the one word they

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:84%
know has power, the power to
control options, the power

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.340 align:middle line:90%
to stop their world.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
the word no is.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Instead of the word
that has the authority

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.012 align:middle line:84%
to keep their world
moving, which is

00:11:11.012 --> 00:11:12.220 align:middle line:90%
yes-- do you want to go here?

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:12.580 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:90%
Let's try that.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to try this?

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.372 align:middle line:90%
That sounds great.

00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, how about if
we do the-- yes.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.360 align:middle line:90%
That sounds wonderful.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, does this sound
like a good idea?

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely yes.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.410 align:middle line:90%
Let's give that a try.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:84%
That's how powerful
the word yes is.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
But when you feel
powerless, you're

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.890 align:middle line:84%
going to go to the tiniest
word that stops everything

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:90%
from flowing in your life.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
This is how powerful
the tiniest words are.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.950 align:middle line:84%
What words do you have
to constantly remind

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
yourself of the words that
other people have said to you?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a great
big huge question

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
because you can
either remind yourself

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:00.210 align:middle line:84%
of positive words people
have said that inspire you

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:02.430 align:middle line:90%
or words that deplete you.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.760 align:middle line:84%
When I was in high school,
I had a bit of an attitude.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And I know that's hard
to imagine, but I did.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And I thought that
when you're inspired,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.630 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be
educated, that inspiration

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.970 align:middle line:90%
was its own education.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:84%
And I soon learned that
that wasn't the case.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And this one wonderful nun
said to me, come here, Missy.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:90%
She said, here's your paper.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.730 align:middle line:90%
And I got a very bad grade.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.147 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have
to go into that.

00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:40.350 align:middle line:84%
But what she did say
was, listen here.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be
a writer, you have

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.990 align:middle line:84%
to learn the laws of English
so that you can break them

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.040 align:middle line:90%
like a master.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.750 align:middle line:90%
None of this stuff again.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Those words were
the greatest wisdom.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I reminded myself
of them again and again

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.340 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Other people remind
themselves of words people

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:90%
said to them that hurt them.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.280 align:middle line:84%
As I was in healing, and I
listened to people remind me

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:84%
of their wounds, I would
think, why do you keep

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.880 align:middle line:90%
reminding yourself of that?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Why do you keep playing that
over and over and over again?

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've said to
people so many times,

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:84%
if you could see
those people again,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.880 align:middle line:84%
and you would have the
opportunity to say to them,

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:90%
you said this to me.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
You said to me I would
never be worthwhile.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
Would that satisfy you
to take those words

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:90%
and give them back to them?

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.110 align:middle line:90%
What do you think would happen?

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, I would feel satisfied.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.770 align:middle line:90%
Would you?

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
What if what really would
happen is they would say to you,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
saying that to you.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't remember those words.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:90%
You remember them.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:90%
But I don't.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.465 align:middle line:90%
And that's the truth.

00:14:03.465 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about something.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Let's move to this.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
What's the most liberating
word that you could actually

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:90%
get the meaning of?

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:90%
And that's the word humble.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to just pause here.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to go inside
the word humble and all that's

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:37.050 align:middle line:84%
connected to the word, which
is humiliating and humbleness--

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
the whole family of that word
because here's what's true.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.940 align:middle line:84%
The word humiliating is
a word that I already

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.140 align:middle line:90%
know is in your head.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.700 align:middle line:90%
I already know that.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is how it talks.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:84%
It says, you can't do
that because you're

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:90%
going to be humiliated.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:90%
Or it speaks like this.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.880 align:middle line:90%
It says, what will they say?

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:90%
And that that word has clout.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Or it speaks to you like this.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.070 align:middle line:90%
It creates fantasies for you.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And one of the fantasies
that it creates

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:13.660 align:middle line:84%
is that you imagine that
your purpose in life

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.760 align:middle line:84%
is to be something
great big huge

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:90%
and glamorous and wonderful.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:84%
Your purpose in life, mind
you, is to be all of this

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:84%
so that you could
go over to someone

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.910 align:middle line:84%
who humiliated you
way back when and say,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:90%
see how important I am?

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:84%
That's what that one
word-- that one word

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:84%
carries that big
a universe in it.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:84%
When I was writing about
this in Entering the Castle,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I looked up the word
humiliation, humble.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The Oxford English Dictionary
lists humble as being poor,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.710 align:middle line:90%
to be poor.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.370 align:middle line:90%
And that is not true at all.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
If I could give you
one word to empower you

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.710 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of your
life, I would say,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:90%
here's the word, humble.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:90%
Be humble.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is as powerful
as understanding

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.640 align:middle line:90%
the meaning of humble.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:84%
If you could pour
that word into you,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:84%
drench yourself in
the meaning of what

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:28.970 align:middle line:84%
it is to walk this
world with humbleness,

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.270 align:middle line:90%
to humble up as my motto--

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:84%
picture yourself this
way, that all the words

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.725 align:middle line:84%
that people say to
you that you fear,

00:16:38.725 --> 00:16:40.100 align:middle line:84%
that you'll never
be good enough,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
or they're better than you,
no longer have clout over you,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.700 align:middle line:84%
because that feeling
of pride or hubris

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
would evaporate
because you would begin

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:57.170 align:middle line:84%
to feel a power in
yourself that says,

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.830 align:middle line:90%
I don't need their approval.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.900 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with me?

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%
Why would I need their approval?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.730 align:middle line:84%
That world is not
better than me.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Humbleness is not about poverty.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.040 align:middle line:90%
It's about freedom.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.859 align:middle line:84%
With a motto like humble
up, let's talk about words

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:84%
you should ban and
never, ever use again.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.050 align:middle line:84%
The word deserve-- if I was
your spiritual director,

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and you were sitting
across from me,

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I would say, now, exactly
what do you think you deserve?

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And where do you get
off with the idea

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.610 align:middle line:90%
that you deserve anything?

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Is it because of where you were
born or because of your height?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Where does that come from?

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And what you'd say to me
is because you've suffered.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:90%
You've worked so hard.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:90%
You've this or that.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
You'd come up with some
excuse, all of which

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I would counteract.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Deserve indulges your
worst entitlements.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:84%
That one word gives you
permission to pick up a drink,

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.460 align:middle line:84%
to overspend, or to
overeat, for example.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Deserve is a word that
gets you in trouble.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.940 align:middle line:90%
Take it out of your vocabulary.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Just do it for a week
and watch what happens.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Blame.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.640 align:middle line:90%
Blame is another word.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Blame is a punitive
word where you

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:20.180 align:middle line:84%
want to discount your
own responsibility.

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:90%
You can't use the word blame.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And here's another word.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this one's not going to go
over big, but it's the truth.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:90%
Entitled.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.750 align:middle line:90%
You aren't entitled to anything.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:90%
That word is a rough one.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And I don't mean it
politically, by the way.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:90%
I mean nobody is born entitled.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.780 align:middle line:90%
None of us.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, my favorite Saint,
Teresa of Ávila, who I adore,

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
she used to say to her nuns,
you're not entitled to anything

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:10%
And I don't want to
see it in your face.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.400 align:middle line:10%
And then she would
follow it with this.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.455 align:middle line:84%
Everything wonderful
that happens

00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:84%
to you, all the good
things in your life,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
you did not make
it happen to you.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.250 align:middle line:90%
You're not entitled to them.

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:90%
They are given to you.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.685 align:middle line:90%
And that's called blessing.

00:19:11.685 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
Think about someone who
absolutely loves you.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, one day, when
they're not looking at you,

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
go look at them and imagine that
this is what they're thinking.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.050 align:middle line:84%
They're thinking that their
life is so much better

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:84%
because you're in it,
because you're in it

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.540 align:middle line:84%
and that if something
happened to you,

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:90%
they would mourn deeply.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And their whole world would
change because you're not in.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're not entitled
to that kind of love.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless,
it happened to you.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:52.930 align:middle line:84%
Somehow you found somebody who
loves you that much and thinks,

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:90%
my world would be so empty.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And that person could be
your partner, your lover,

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
your husband, your wife, even
your children, your friends.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.240 align:middle line:84%
You can't make that
kind of love happen.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You do not have that kind of--
and here's the operative word--

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.240 align:middle line:90%
power.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.420 align:middle line:90%
You just don't have it.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:90%
But it happened.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So take the word entitled out,
and put the word blessing in.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And look at all of these
wondrous things that

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.990 align:middle line:84%
happened to you and think,
I am seriously blessed.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a word you can use.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And don't crave false praise or
endless attention, for example.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.850 align:middle line:84%
You will end up
compromising yourself.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.920 align:middle line:84%
You will negotiate
some part of your soul

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.650 align:middle line:84%
to get something that
is not worth anything,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:84%
perhaps a glance
from a stranger,

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
only to realize you've
given up something

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:84%
so precious of yourself for
the illusion of a second's

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:90%
worth of meaningless attention.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:57.773 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.773 --> 00:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Here's another word
you're going to take out--

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:90%
judge.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't judge things,
including yourself--

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:90%
including yourself.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
How do you know
what's good or bad?

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
How do you know when something
happens to you if it's

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.050 align:middle line:90%
a disaster or an opportunity?

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.620 align:middle line:84%
I won't bother sharing those
many, many stories that say,

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.800 align:middle line:90%
this is a disaster.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:90%
This is good or this is bad.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:90%
There's so many.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But you know if you
judge everything

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.230 align:middle line:84%
by whether it's
pain or pleasure,

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:30.780 align:middle line:84%
you're going to end up
down the wrong street.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Here's the word that
you're going to use--

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.750 align:middle line:90%
wisdom.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:90%
I need some serious wisdom here.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And wisdom tells me to
back off and to not get

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
attached to what's happening
here and to say, how is it

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:84%
that I should respond
in this moment?

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
And watch my words.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Watch how frame this.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Do I tell myself
this is a disaster?

00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Or do I say, be centered.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Be still and trust
what's happening

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and work my way through
it with courage.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:07.430 align:middle line:90%
Here's a word you need--

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:90%
courage.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.640 align:middle line:90%
Be centered.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you reflect on what
is happening in that moment.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.850 align:middle line:90%
Here's the truth.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.460 align:middle line:84%
We're terrified to
become conscious.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.960 align:middle line:90%
We really are.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.150 align:middle line:84%
We're terrified because the
more conscious we become,

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
we have to become very
mindful of the words we use.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.020 align:middle line:84%
We have to become
incredibly mindful.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.960 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things we become
mindful of is we become more

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
conscious, is that we have to
redefine our responsibilities

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.680 align:middle line:90%
to the whole of humanity.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.660 align:middle line:84%
We have to really get we're
not isolated creatures.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We have responsibilities
to the whole.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:90%
What is in one is in the whole.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.580 align:middle line:84%
I belong to everybody, and
everybody belongs to me,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
that, in fact, what I
say matters to everybody.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.510 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:10.140 align:middle line:84%
We actually don't want
these things to be true.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.930 align:middle line:90%
Holism is great on paper.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a great
deal to live holism.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.840 align:middle line:90%
It takes a great deal.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:90%
So what words empower us?

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.185 align:middle line:90%
What words?

00:23:25.185 --> 00:23:26.310 align:middle line:90%
These are the big leaguers.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:29.190 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.330 align:middle line:90%
I talked about humble.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.410 align:middle line:90%
But here are some others.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:90%
Mercy.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Mercy is a powerhouse.

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Compassion.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:90%
Detachment.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.710 align:middle line:90%
Stay detached, like I said.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Hold yourself detached before
you respond to something.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And then consciously
reflect and say,

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
what words am I going to use
to frame the experience that I

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.200 align:middle line:90%
am in?

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you
a workshop exercise.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.040 align:middle line:10%
Now, I told people in
a workshop one time--

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:10%
I said, I want you to tell
me all about yourself.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.360 align:middle line:10%
And I want you to
language this in words

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:10%
you've never used before.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:11.280 align:middle line:84%
But you can't use
negative words.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.090 align:middle line:84%
You have to tell
me about yourself,

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:15.750 align:middle line:84%
but you can't bring
your baggage with you.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.910 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell me anything
about your history.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.000 align:middle line:90%
A lot of them couldn't do it.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.810 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them couldn't--
because they were so used

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:28.140 align:middle line:84%
to the negative language
of saying, well,

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
their wounds or their
history was so filled with

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.710 align:middle line:90%
the negative.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, I asked
one woman who I knew

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.400 align:middle line:84%
had been sharing her wounds
with everyone to tell me

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.130 align:middle line:84%
about herself, only I
asked her to leave out

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.840 align:middle line:90%
her painful history.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.480 align:middle line:84%
I asked her to highlight
all the positive things that

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.760 align:middle line:84%
had happened in her life, as
no one's life is all sorrow

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:90%
or suffering.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And she stared at me, as if
I'd asked her to jump off

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:90%
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.320 align:middle line:84%
And she began to cough
and cough and cough.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And finally, she excused
herself from our conversation.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, tell me something
positive about your past.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Talk to me about all the
good things that happened.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And for them, it was
difficult. It was

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.670 align:middle line:84%
difficult. The
exercise is, think

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.490 align:middle line:84%
about the wisdom that was
said to you in your life,

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:90%
the good words that were said.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.360 align:middle line:90%
And here's another exercise.

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Do you empower other
people with your language

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:90%
or disempower them?

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to the
language you use.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And note if it's difficult for
you to empower another person.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:90%
And ask yourself, why?

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Reflect on that, that
I can't use a power

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.270 align:middle line:90%
word with another person.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
to ask yourself,

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:84%
what exactly is that about,
that I find empowering

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:59.240 align:middle line:90%
other people difficult?

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, even the subtlest
choice changes a position.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Decide, for example, that
you're going to pay attention

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.900 align:middle line:84%
to the tone of voice that
you use when you use words,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.510 align:middle line:90%
that that's a big deal.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:84%
As you begin to
listen to words, you

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
decide that I even have
to watch the volume.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:33.270 align:middle line:84%
The subtlest choices
make a big difference.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So just consider the
power of these two words

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:90%
when I ask this question.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready to really be free?

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.810 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.860 align:middle line:90%
