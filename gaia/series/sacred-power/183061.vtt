00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> The order of this universe
is built on law and order.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies operate
according to law,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:84%
nature operates
according to law.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.900 align:middle line:90%
God is law.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And law sounds so impersonal,
but here's the thing--

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.740 align:middle line:84%
this is a totally
impersonal universe.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.565 align:middle line:90%

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.880 align:middle line:10%
How we understand
the nature of god

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.630 align:middle line:10%
is undergoing the most
significant transformation

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.880 align:middle line:10%
in the history of humanity.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.230 align:middle line:10%
Hi, I'm Caroline Myss.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.250 align:middle line:10%
And we can't talk
about sacred power

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:10%
without talking about god.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.350 align:middle line:10%
Never before has humanity
experienced this level

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:10%
of disengagement from religious
traditions or the very question

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:10%
of the existence of god.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:10%
Now, think about that.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:10%
Think about that.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.600 align:middle line:84%
The fact that,
for the first time

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in the history of humanity,
a vast majority of people

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.220 align:middle line:84%
are questioning the
existence of god.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
For every choice,
there's a consequence.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.090 align:middle line:84%
What's the consequence
of a high percentage

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.630 align:middle line:84%
of people in a
society questioning

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.070 align:middle line:90%
the existence of god?

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.540 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not speaking to you
from the position of, let's say,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:10%
fundamentalism or
Armageddon, where

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.828 align:middle line:10%
I'm warning you that
the fires of hell

00:01:43.828 --> 00:01:45.120 align:middle line:10%
are going to come raining down.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't
believe in any of that.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking pure mystical
law, that there's a cause

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:90%
and there's effect.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:84%
There's action and
there's reaction.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And that we live
in a universe where

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.030 align:middle line:84%
our thoughts and our
collective consciousness

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:84%
holds together the
world that we live in.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.310 align:middle line:10%
So when a high percentage
of the population

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:10%
begins to question
the nature of god,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.650 align:middle line:10%
what happens to the
collective, the global,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.980 align:middle line:10%
the different
pockets of society?

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Anger, division, and disdain
at traditional religions'

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.680 align:middle line:84%
inability to keep up with
the needs of a modern devotee

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
has only encouraged
people to become

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:84%
very distant from religions
that they've been connected to.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want you to jump into
this moment we're living in

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.670 align:middle line:90%
because it's so extraordinary.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Let me just position
this so that you don't

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:90%
miss the time you're living in.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.730 align:middle line:90%
So it doesn't bypass you.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:10%
But never, ever, ever before,
in the history of humanity,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:10%
has every single species,
has every single creature,

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.200 align:middle line:10%
has every single plant,
has every single molecule

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:10%
and every single human
being been a participant

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:10%
in the same experience.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:90%
In the same experience.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
is this transformation

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.108 align:middle line:84%
into a different age
of consciousness.

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, that alone should
make you sit down and say,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I got to think about this.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.590 align:middle line:90%
It takes my breath away.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.420 align:middle line:90%
It's so big.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:90%
It's so enormous.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.050 align:middle line:10%
And part of that
transformation includes

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.350 align:middle line:10%
transforming how it is we
understand the nature of god.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
The god that has carried us
for the last thousands of years

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:84%
may not be the same myth
of god that will carry us

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:90%
into the galactic era.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:84%
The gods that have held the
planet together up until now

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.500 align:middle line:90%
have been Earth centric.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:90%
They've come from Earth.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:90%
They look like us.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.260 align:middle line:90%
They walk like us.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:90%
They reflect human nature.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:84%
To some extent, we
began this process

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
of detaching from
the gods of our era

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:90%
when we entered the nuclear age.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:10%
Then the idea that
the archetype of god

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.680 align:middle line:10%
as man, whether it was from
the messianic tradition,

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.710 align:middle line:10%
and then moving
into the son of man

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:10%
as god and the holy prophet.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
This god as man, leaving
out the feminine.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.470 align:middle line:84%
That archetypal pattern--
its time has come to an end.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, pause button time so you
get used to me as a teacher.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.980 align:middle line:84%
When I introduce these
enormous concepts,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:90%
these cosmic sized ideas--

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:90%
and they are--

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I do not teach from the
position that anything

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
is right or wrong, good or
bad, or that one religion's

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:84%
at fault. I never teach
from that position.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I teach from the
position of history,

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.520 align:middle line:84%
as if I could take you
to an observation deck

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
so that you can observe
how change happens.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.620 align:middle line:84%
How by shifting a myth,
by shifting a belief,

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.280 align:middle line:84%
how that one thing
begins to have a domino

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
effect within a collective
global experience

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.695 align:middle line:90%
of human beings.

00:06:13.695 --> 00:06:16.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.890 align:middle line:84%
How that one thing
can cause societies,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.520 align:middle line:84%
can cause people to go to
war because they don't really

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:90%
get what's going on.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand that
the lights are going out

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:84%
in their myths of god, and
they will fight to the death

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:84%
to keep those stories
going, but it's too late

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:90%
because those stories are over.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.940 align:middle line:90%
So take notes.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Take notes.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.020 align:middle line:84%
Because what is happening around
you is happening within you.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.550 align:middle line:84%
This idea that we look
out there for some god

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:84%
to come floating in and
coming in to save our lives,

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:90%
to save our planet.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:90%
That story is over.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.970 align:middle line:84%
It's no wonder that in
churches, or in synagogues,

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
or in these traditional
religions that the younger

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:90%
people--

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
that populations
are saying, I just

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in that anymore.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:10%
But here's the thing--

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:29.960 align:middle line:10%
our need to believe is
something we cannot throw away.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:10%
We will never throw
that away because that

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.870 align:middle line:10%
is deep in our soul.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And what is replacing that
Earth centric religion is what

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.650 align:middle line:90%
I think of as organic divinity.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:55.270 align:middle line:10%
The nature of the
divine is emerging in us

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.580 align:middle line:10%
as we stand on the cusp
of galactic spirituality.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:90%
How's that for a sentence?

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.030 align:middle line:90%
I mean, is that big or what?

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:11.120 align:middle line:84%
So let me take you
into this next era.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And you know what makes
us vulnerable right now?

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.830 align:middle line:90%
And we are.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:10%
We're spiritually
very vulnerable.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:10%
And that's because
we no longer fit

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:10%
into the myths from
which we have come--

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:10%
the old religions.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:10%
And yet, we haven't
decided what it

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.169 align:middle line:10%
is we're going to believe in.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:10%
So here we are
floating in between,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.120 align:middle line:10%
where we haven't yet figured
out what's out there that we're

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:10%
going to believe in.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I've noticed
people have in common,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and it's paradoxical,
and it's painful,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.150 align:middle line:84%
and it can be very
vulnerable to the individual

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
is that people will say,
leave me alone spiritually.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure what I believe.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:11.800 align:middle line:84%
And something that I have
found to be true in this era,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:84%
it is more the case
that I meet people

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:17.140 align:middle line:84%
who can tell me with absolute
conviction what they do not

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
believe in than what
they do believe in.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.340 align:middle line:10%
They know for sure
what they absolutely

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:10%
don't have faith in than
what they do have faith in.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And I will tell you that
that forms the basis

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:90%
of a very serious crisis.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a crisis.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Because deep inside
of you, deep in you,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.520 align:middle line:90%
this is how you're wired.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.640 align:middle line:84%
You are wired to
believe in something

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:90%
greater than yourself.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:54.120 align:middle line:84%
You are wired to look for
awe, to be struck with awe.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.470 align:middle line:84%
You are absolutely
wired that way.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So here we find ourselves in
this collective crisis of god.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.530 align:middle line:90%
This is the era of the soul.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Up until this time, the idea
of our deeper consciousness

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.330 align:middle line:84%
was not something
anyone ever discussed.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:10%
If you think your grandparents
or your parents ever spoke

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.860 align:middle line:10%
about the consciousness
of their soul,

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:26.540 align:middle line:10%
or they ever spoke about
their ability to co-create

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.380 align:middle line:10%
their reality, or if they
ever sat back and said,

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.150 align:middle line:10%
I wonder what the
purpose of my life is--

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.060 align:middle line:10%
if they ever asked
soul sized questions--

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:10%
soul sized-- the kinds of
questions that redirected

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:10%
their life, you're mistaken.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.880 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do that.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, think about what you do.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.210 align:middle line:10%
You ask those questions.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:84%
You think nothing
of saying, you know,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.966 align:middle line:90%
I wonder what reason I was born.

00:10:56.966 --> 00:11:00.570 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't even occur
to you not to ask that.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.950 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
For you, going in the
world behind your eye

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:90%
is ordinary space.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:14.830 align:middle line:84%
For you, the inner frontier
is the new frontier.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:20.600 align:middle line:84%
Going into the soul has
become the new normal.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:10%
But the old idea of god does
not work for the depth charges

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.330 align:middle line:10%
of how we need to understand
the nature of god that

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:10%
matches what we're
discovering about the soul.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I realize that
probably for most of you,

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.220 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the
soul as a companion

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
or an active part of your life
is such an outrageous idea.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Most of you maybe not even think
of the soul is just a word,

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
or you don't think of
it at all, actually.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:04.250 align:middle line:90%
But that's not smart.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:84%
The soul is your
nuclear power battery.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.840 align:middle line:90%
It's actually your life battery.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And the more I've
worked with healing,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:84%
the more I realize,
you know what?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Healing is not the
enterprise of the mind.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the enterprise of the soul.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:90%
It is the soul's task to heal.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.670 align:middle line:84%
It is the soul in you
that has the power

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:84%
to generate and accomplish a
task that doesn't make sense

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
to the mind, and that's
where true healing is.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.540 align:middle line:10%
Now, for me personally,
you know that I

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:10%
have a background in medical
intuition and healing.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:10%
I never expected
that that background

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.730 align:middle line:10%
would cross and collide with
my personal spiritual life.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.160 align:middle line:10%
I never, ever, ever did.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.270 align:middle line:10%
For me personally,
my spiritual path

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:10%
was my business, not
yours, and I would never

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:12.490 align:middle line:10%
have even thought to
share it with anybody.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.190 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I spent years
studying theology

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:10%
with the most brilliant Jesuits
you can possibly imagine.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.750 align:middle line:84%
None of them told
me about chakras.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.650 align:middle line:84%
None of them told me how
well organized the soul was.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Like, where were they?

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Where did this technical
soul come from?

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I start doing
medical intuitive readings.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.890 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, let me
point out something--

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.342 align:middle line:84%
I never wanted to be
a medical intuitive.

00:13:44.342 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:90%
It never even occurred to me.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:90%
I didn't even know what it was.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:90%
I just discovered I could.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.190 align:middle line:90%
That I was good at it.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And as I did that, I became
better at it, and then better,

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and then really good, and
then the rest of my life

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.700 align:middle line:90%
took flight from that direction.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
My absolute fascination
was with god.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:90%
Not with healing.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
With god.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And with all things possible
in the invisible world.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, that was a
world I understood.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But now I was
coming at it through

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:90%
my biospiritual ecology.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.570 align:middle line:84%
As I looked at healing, as
I started to ask questions,

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I first started to ask,
why don't people heal?

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Then I started to
ask, what is healing?

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:90%
How can people heal?

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And that brought me to
the laws of the universe.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And what I began to realize
was that everything, everything

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:84%
in this universe, everything
is organized around laws.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may be totally
obvious to the scientist.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It may be totally
obvious to you.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.900 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't an epiphany.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:10%
An epiphany is one of those
awakenings that's more than a,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:10%
boy, I get it.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:10%
An epiphany is when all seven
of your chakras, right down

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:10%
to your soul, not
just gets it but it

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.260 align:middle line:10%
reorders your understanding
of your own universe.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.170 align:middle line:84%
You get it so deeply that
your rapport with all things

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:40.080 align:middle line:84%
alive is shifted in the
blink of a holy eye.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:84%
So when I say to you that I
understood that god was law,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:90%
I saw it everywhere.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:56.750 align:middle line:84%
I saw it in the organization
of our biophysical design.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:90%
I saw it in nature.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:90%
Disease is organized by law.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:90%
This is the laws of cancer.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.870 align:middle line:84%
If we didn't have laws
there, we wouldn't

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:90%
be able to heal anything.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I saw it in the
laws of science--

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:84%
in action and reaction,
cause and effect.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The laws of sensing,
the laws of physics,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
the laws of the planets, the
laws of the orbits, gravity--

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:90%
for everything is law.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:10%
And then I understood that in
the nature of god, of course

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:10%
it's law.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Because law has no religion.

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:10%
Law is consistent.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:10%
You can count on law
and, therefore, you

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.090 align:middle line:10%
can count on the nature of god.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.960 align:middle line:10%
And then that's when
the teachings of Jesus,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:10%
and Buddha, and the mystical
traditions of Hinduism,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.880 align:middle line:10%
and the mystical traditions
of the Upanishads,

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:10%
and all the great scriptures
just lined up in my head.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.660 align:middle line:10%
And I've got a big
archive up here.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.079 align:middle line:10%
They just want [WHOOSH]
and the laws came out.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything lined up.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
Even back down to
Plato and Pythagoras,

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:17.725 align:middle line:84%
Aristotle, mathematics because
that is the nature of god.

00:17:17.725 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Now then, let's calm
down and get into you.

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Now I want to take
you by the hand

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and I want to walk
you into your soul.

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be
the new theology.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:40.490 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be how you
will know the nature of god.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:10%
The nature of god
is going to be known

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:52.230 align:middle line:10%
to us through the biospiritual
ecology of who we are,

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:10%
of how we understand our health.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:84%
As we learn the laws
of science, they

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.220 align:middle line:84%
are a mirror of the
mystical laws of heaven.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:90%
These teachings are everywhere.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
What I do to the least of my
brethren, I do to everybody.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:84%
What Buddha says,
what happens in one

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:90%
is in the whole of everything.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:10%
Now, as a medical
intuitive and someone

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.620 align:middle line:10%
who is deeply committed to your
healing, as well as my own,

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.080 align:middle line:10%
one of the core mystical
laws is that all is one.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.880 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
That sounds great
on paper, right?

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:90%
All is one.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:35.190 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.320 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.550 align:middle line:10%
You're going to get it
really good because it

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:10%
is a biological truth.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.770 align:middle line:10%
If I said to you,
look, you know what?

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.320 align:middle line:10%
Your kidney is really sick.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.460 align:middle line:84%
I've got some medicine
here, but it's

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.020 align:middle line:90%
going to blow out your heart.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.810 align:middle line:84%
But hey, your kidney
is going to be fine.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:10%
Would you take that medicine?

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.360 align:middle line:10%
Absolutely not.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:10%
You would say, do
you got anything that

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:10%
will treat the whole of me?

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
Because you're already
operating on that mystical truth

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and that scientific truth--

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.270 align:middle line:90%
that law that all is one.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that that law
is already commanding you.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the fundamental
truths of this era

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that we are shifting to.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It's already part of your
biospiritual theology.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Get used to that word.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:90%
Your theology.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:90%
Your ecological theology.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.480 align:middle line:10%
The time has come for
the greater truth, which

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:10%
is all is one, to become an
active force in our thinking

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.900 align:middle line:10%
and for the nature
of god to become

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.570 align:middle line:10%
an active principle
in our politics,

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.150 align:middle line:10%
and our biology, and
our thought process.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.810 align:middle line:10%
To become an actual
building block of life

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:10%
itself so that theology
is no longer in a building

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:10%
but in our body
and in our actions.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So that we actually
get all is one.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.800 align:middle line:10%
And that if I violate that,
I pay for it with my health.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.140 align:middle line:90%
I pay for it in my body.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It is no longer something that
I just get an option to believe.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:10%
My body will break
down if I do not

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.670 align:middle line:10%
honor all is one because it is
a biospiritual mystical law.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.130 align:middle line:10%
That is organic theology.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:35.440 align:middle line:84%
That is god in my
blood and in my bones.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:90%
And that is the new theology.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.195 align:middle line:90%
That is where we're going.

00:20:40.195 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.460 align:middle line:84%
In this great transition
we're going through--

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and I realize I'm
throwing a lot at you,

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.170 align:middle line:84%
but one of the things
we do as we change

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:57.400 align:middle line:84%
eras of consciousness
and historic eras

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.160 align:middle line:90%
is that we toss out words.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:90%
We throw out old vocabulary.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who uses the word train
car anymore, or covered wagon?

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:21.200 align:middle line:10%
But we have thrown out a lot of
essential words, holy language,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:10%
that is essential to the
navigation of your soul.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.260 align:middle line:84%
It's one thing to
throw out words

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:84%
as we maneuver from
leaving behind traditions

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.990 align:middle line:84%
whose time has come
to release, but it's

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.290 align:middle line:84%
another thing to
let words go that we

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:90%
must have to navigate the soul.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:53.440 align:middle line:10%
As we maneuver into this
era of organic theology,

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.260 align:middle line:10%
we must keep our
feet on sacred ground

00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:10%
and remain humble and take
some essential words with us.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:09.250 align:middle line:10%
For example, those holy
rituals that we must have,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.940 align:middle line:10%
like the sacraments.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:17.440 align:middle line:84%
They're not social rituals,
they're holy soul rituals.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
I have seen people not heal
because they can't forgive.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:90%
They just can't forgive.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.660 align:middle line:84%
They tell me, well, I'm
working on it, working on it,

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.550 align:middle line:90%
working on it.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.050 align:middle line:90%
How do you work on forgiveness?

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.550 align:middle line:90%
You either do or you don't.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.640 align:middle line:84%
Because with
forgiveness, the issue

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:84%
is not that they can't
forgive, it's vengeance.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.620 align:middle line:84%
I still am imagining how I want
to just punish that person.

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've said to
audiences, you're

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
using the wrong language.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.010 align:middle line:90%
You're not using holy language.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I want you to really pull up
the thing you can't forgive.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is that
happened to you.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And so often someone will tell
me, well, they apologized,

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.140 align:middle line:90%
but I can't forgive them.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that
you can't let go of?

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:10.660 align:middle line:84%
The reason you can't forgive
is because in that moment,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.010 align:middle line:84%
you actually realize that
a person rarely means

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:90%
I didn't mean to hurt you.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.620 align:middle line:84%
What you sense is, in addition
to what they've actually done,

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.820 align:middle line:90%
they're lying to you.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:84%
What you know in that micro
instant of interaction is,

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.850 align:middle line:84%
I actually know you had an
option to choose otherwise,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.810 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't, and
you're not admitting that.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So now let me give you
the word that you need.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:90%
What is a sin?

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, that sounds
like an archaic--

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
oh, don't pull out that
Catholic word, Carol.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't go there.

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm pulling out that word.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.810 align:middle line:10%
But I'm pulling out that
word as an archetype,

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:59.760 align:middle line:10%
as a vocabulary that does
not belong to Catholicism.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.950 align:middle line:10%
It belongs to the soul.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.280 align:middle line:10%
To the soul.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:10%
What is a sin?

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:10%
Do you know what a sin is?

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:10%
A sin is something that
when somebody consciously--

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.300 align:middle line:10%
here's the operative word--

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.300 align:middle line:10%
consciously chooses
to do something

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:22.040 align:middle line:10%
and they know for a
fact that this action is

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:27.650 align:middle line:10%
going to harm someone else, they
know that what I choose to do

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.890 align:middle line:10%
will adversely harm that
person or those people.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:35.000 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't stop me, so
it is my conscious choice

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.390 align:middle line:10%
to hurt another person's life.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.370 align:middle line:90%
That's not a booboo.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.950 align:middle line:84%
That's not a geeze,
that's a bummer.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.450 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:84%
That's the conscious
action to initiate evil.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And if someone came
up to you and said,

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:middle line:90%
I have to talk to you.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I apologized and I said I
didn't mean to do something,

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.690 align:middle line:90%
but you know what the truth is?

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.190 align:middle line:90%
I was conscious of it.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:03.000 align:middle line:84%
I knew it would harm you
and it didn't stop me.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.510 align:middle line:90%
I sinned against you.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:84%
My soul harmed your
soul, and it was a sin.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Holy language has the power
to heal wounds that ordinary

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
language cannot heal
because it carries grace.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:33.360 align:middle line:10%
As we move into
this shift, I would

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:38.700 align:middle line:10%
ask you to dwell on
the nature of god

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.930 align:middle line:10%
in a very different light.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:10%
Don't tell yourself
that you don't need god,

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:10%
because it's not true.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:51.370 align:middle line:84%
You just make sure you think,
there is something greater

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:84%
than me in this universe
to which I am accountable,

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:90%
because there is.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And then call it
whatever you want.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:10%
But in this
impersonal universe--

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell
you something--

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.850 align:middle line:10%
what makes it
personal is prayer.

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And whether or not you get
it, every prayer is heard.

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.320 align:middle line:90%
Every single prayer.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Because every thought
is an act of creation,

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.340 align:middle line:84%
we ought to consider
every thought as a prayer

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.140 align:middle line:84%
and become very, very mindful
of the quality of our thought,

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and how we think about
others, and the power

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:35.470 align:middle line:84%
we have to convey
love and support, even

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
within the silence
of the thoughts

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.540 align:middle line:90%
that we transmit to each other.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.710 align:middle line:90%
This is the era of the soul.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:51.970 align:middle line:84%
We are discovering that our soul
is our greatest spiritual ally,

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and that is the truth.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.430 align:middle line:84%
So on that note, dare
I say this to you,

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.310 align:middle line:90%
bless you and thank you.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.960 align:middle line:90%
