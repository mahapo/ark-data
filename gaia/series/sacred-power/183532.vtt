>> An empowered daily
life takes a lot of work.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And the first priority is
that you have to really commit

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:90%
to not living a wounded life.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.740 align:middle line:84%
What part of nature is devoted
to being broken and wounded?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's number one.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Number two is that in order to
really live an empowered life,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
you have to understand
what empowered is.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.960 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
speaking your truth.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.270 align:middle line:84%
It's about learning to tell
the truth and pursue the truth.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.470 align:middle line:84%
This is our last episode
together on "Sacred Power",

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle line:84%
so it's going to be a little
bit more personal because I feel

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.200 align:middle line:84%
like you've gotten to
know me and how I work

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.980 align:middle line:84%
and where I come from and what
my inner nature is all about.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought I would
take you a little bit more

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:84%
deeply into how
I would guide you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
if you were with me
in my office and you

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
had questions like, how would
you direct me spiritually?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And so with that in
mind, I've set up

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:90%
this last episode together.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
powerful sentences

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:84%
I've ever read in
my life was written

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.700 align:middle line:84%
by the great Catholic Trappist
writer, priest, intellectual,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.250 align:middle line:90%
Thomas Merton in 1968.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.410 align:middle line:84%
These six words grabbed
ahold of my entire life

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and positioned it
right in front of me.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:10%
"This day will
never come again."

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know it's such a simple
and obvious statement, maybe,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:90%
for all of you.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.742 align:middle line:84%
But that struck me as one of
the most significant truths--

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:90%
and it's a prayer--

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
that I would ever
realize in my life.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a truth that I've reminded
myself of every day since.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.110 align:middle line:84%
I've written about it,
and it's made a difference

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.700 align:middle line:90%
in the lives of people.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know that
Merton ever intended that.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.930 align:middle line:10%
But somehow that last
sentence in his journal

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:10%
just struck me like
a bolt of lightning,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.670 align:middle line:10%
that thought that
I would never see

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.320 align:middle line:10%
the same sunrise, the same
sunset, that no flower would

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:10%
look the same to me,
that I would never

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.190 align:middle line:10%
have the same conversation
with the same people.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
This is a once in a
lifetime moment for me.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.030 align:middle line:84%
I will never see their
faces just this way again.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Everything about it
is precious to me.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
will come this day, what

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.400 align:middle line:84%
incredible things
may happen or not.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:90%
It's become a living truth.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.390 align:middle line:90%
It's become a living prayer.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:84%
It means that I don't have time
to waste with small things.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:84%
When you think about the
value of friends and family,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
you don't wait to tell
them that you love them.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
You forgive them fast
and forget even faster.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't have time to waste
because this day, this moment,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:90%
will never, ever come again.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Deeper than that,
it's vitally important

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
for you to have a daily
practice for your soul

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:84%
and that that daily
practice is based

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.510 align:middle line:84%
upon sacred truth, sacred
truth that naturally guides

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:84%
you and contributes to
the world as a structure

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.610 align:middle line:90%
of holy and sacred power.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.350 align:middle line:84%
A short recap--
we've learned how

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.780 align:middle line:84%
we can become our
own medical intuitive

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
by slowing down and listening
to what our body is telling us

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:90%
in every moment.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.600 align:middle line:84%
We've learned how developing
our spiritual self esteem

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely necessary for
a positive and healthy life.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Most importantly of all,
we've learned about power--

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
the power of choice,
the power of words,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
the power of our
invisible deeds,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
the power of our archetypal
patterns, the power of grace,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and the power of God
and prayer in our lives.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
This episode is about
how you integrate power

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.730 align:middle line:90%
into your daily lives.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.880 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to eat
right and to go to the gym.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.112 align:middle line:90%
I think that's great.

00:04:52.112 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:90%
I think it's all great.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Those things are not enough.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:84%
They're not enough
to make you a whole

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.783 align:middle line:84%
and happy and ebullient
and conscious person.

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:90%
You know what else you need?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.660 align:middle line:90%
You need wisdom.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:90%
You need to nourish your soul.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:84%
You need a practice
of consciousness.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:90%
And you need grace.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:90%
You need a steady diet of grace.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.705 align:middle line:90%
There-- I said it.

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:19.505 align:middle line:90%
You need grace.

00:05:19.505 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And so what I want to share
with you is my counsel on what

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.490 align:middle line:84%
keeps grace active
for you, what is

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.190 align:middle line:84%
a contemporary
spiritual practice

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.130 align:middle line:84%
in this world where
some people can't

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.500 align:middle line:90%
bear the sound of the word God.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Some people have no
idea what they believe.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Some people are not sure
what goes where when it

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.360 align:middle line:90%
comes to spirituality.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I get all that.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.810 align:middle line:90%
I get all that.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
But at a much
deeper, deeper level,

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
I address the sacredness in
you when I'm speaking to you.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:10%
And I know that the
sacredness in you

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:10%
is what we have in
common, is that we're all

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.860 align:middle line:10%
seeking the same thing--

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:10%
how to create a
sacred environment

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:24.350 align:middle line:10%
for yourself and a sacred
practice to sustain yourself.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you get
up in the morning,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
thank heaven for this
day, thank the divine,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.110 align:middle line:90%
this gift that is your life.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
ask you to consider

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
doing that is because the
idea of living in gratitude,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
of acknowledging that your life
is measured by more than what's

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
in your bank account or
whether or not you're

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.880 align:middle line:84%
happy or whether or
not you have attention,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
that you recognize I am
acknowledging that being alive

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
is, in fact, the phenomenon that
I am addressing, that if I need

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:84%
to have stuff in order for
me to acknowledge that it's

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.010 align:middle line:84%
good to be alive,
then something's

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.370 align:middle line:90%
wrong with this equation.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The fact that I am alive
is enough reason for me

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:84%
to have gratitude for
this gift of life.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.880 align:middle line:84%
I remember when I was young
that neighbors down the street

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.375 align:middle line:90%
got a built-in swimming pool.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:84%
They were the first
people on the block

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.510 align:middle line:90%
to get a built-in swimming pool.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
I was not even 10 years old,
and I heard someone say,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.760 align:middle line:90%
god must have blessed them.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:84%
But I remember walking
outside and looking

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
at the pool and thinking,
god blessed them

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:90%
with a swimming pool?

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:90%
With a pool?

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:90%
What kind of God is that?

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.100 align:middle line:84%
The idea of a god
as a "stuffologist"

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:17.440 align:middle line:84%
struck me as being
absolutely absurd.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, from that
day on, my wiring was

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:84%
hypersensitive to the idea that
gratitude was based on listing

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:37.119 align:middle line:84%
how much stuff you had instead
of reverence for life itself.

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:38.999 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:42.020 align:middle line:84%
The second thing for
a spiritual practice

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:47.960 align:middle line:84%
is that you become conscious
of living congruently,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
that your head matches
your heart in terms

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
of how you make decisions, that
your head matches your heart,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:90%
that you walk the way you talk.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you, might not
think that's a big deal.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to just
clue you in on something.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.490 align:middle line:84%
It's an enormous, big
effort to get your head

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.530 align:middle line:90%
to match your heart.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
That becoming congruent,
becoming whole,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.430 align:middle line:84%
is a challenge that
each of us goes through.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
Getting the coordinates of how
we think to match how we feel--

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:90%
this is such a big deal.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.640 align:middle line:90%
And this is how we work.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:84%
Our mind works from about 4:00
AM to somewhere around 2:30

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.530 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And then our mind
starts shutting off,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:90%
and our heart takes over.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:50.430 align:middle line:10%
Our mind gets the day shift,
where we're very mental.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.390 align:middle line:10%
And then our heart
gets the evening shift,

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:10%
and we become very emotional.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So we start talking like,
well, I know what I said

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and what I thought, but let
me tell you what I feel.

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we oftentimes
are like two people

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:90%
dwelling in one body.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:90%
And so long as we're like that--

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.950 align:middle line:84%
I know what I think,
but here's how I feel,

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I know what I think--
we will be addicts.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Because in between what
you think and what you feel

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:90%
is your throat.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:84%
This is like Papa Bear,
Mama Bear, and Baby Bear.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And Baby Bear never knows
which parent to listen to.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Remember the log jam we
talked about in episode one?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Your mind and your
heart are often

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
at odds over decisions
in your life.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.370 align:middle line:84%
During this series, you've
been given many tools

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
to help you unite the power
of your heart and mind.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.920 align:middle line:84%
For example, tell
yourself the truth

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:90%
about what you are feeling.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Become mindful of using words
like "blame," "deserve,"

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:90%
and "entitled."

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to how differently
your mind and heart speak,

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.640 align:middle line:84%
often describing
the same situation

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
in conflicting language,
and then consciously

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.640 align:middle line:90%
work to resolve that conflict.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
And remind yourself never
to betray your true feelings

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:90%
by creating excuses.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Use words like "courage,"
"grace," and even "kindness."

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:29.570 align:middle line:84%
So what we do, the only way
to keep our mind and our heart

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
from talking to each other
so that we can keep ourselves

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
from becoming whole,
congruent, clear,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
is to jam something in
our mouth, is to jam

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.940 align:middle line:84%
the circuits between
our head and our heart.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.430 align:middle line:90%
So we overeat.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:90%
We drink.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We make choices that
get us in trouble.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.170 align:middle line:84%
We keep our focus
on the outside.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.620 align:middle line:90%


00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:11.130 align:middle line:84%
And this keeps our head
from talking to our heart.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's a deliberate choice.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.630 align:middle line:90%
And we become addicts.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
The choice to live congruently
is a true dedication

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:90%
to your inner spiritual life.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:90%
And you start out small.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.000 align:middle line:90%
You start out small.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't
plunge into the deep end

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.008 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual pool
right off the bat.

00:12:36.008 --> 00:12:39.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Nobody goes into
their soul unescorted.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:90%
So think of me as your escort.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
You go in through the shallow
end, just a little bit

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.880 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:58.490 align:middle line:84%
Because everything about
going into your soul

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:90%
is so profoundly powerful.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Sacred power is not
something you play with.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
It completely
transforms your life.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And as you decide, I'm going
to start following through

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
and if I feel something's
wrong, I will say it.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.990 align:middle line:90%
I will live there.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:84%
I won't tell myself
something is not true.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And what happens as a
result of just beginning

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
to thread your heart
and your head together

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and speaking that way is that
your intuition, your soul,

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.810 align:middle line:84%
starts speaking
more clearly to you.

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
You become a fully
congruent system.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:55.950 align:middle line:84%
It starts out small, but
it gets bigger and bigger.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.100 align:middle line:90%
So follow me on this.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Stick close to me here.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:08.910 align:middle line:84%
In order to sustain
the consequence

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
of becoming a congruent you,
you're going to need prayer.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need some
kind of deep inner practice.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:26.547 align:middle line:84%
Because becoming congruent
is going to change your life.

00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:27.880 align:middle line:90%
It's going to change your life--

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.350 align:middle line:84%
great big, huge-- not
small, great big, huge.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've
talked about prayer

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're not thinking anymore
about an off-planet god,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.180 align:middle line:84%
consider praying as
an inner conversation

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
with a holy companion in which
you ask for guidance and grace,

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:84%
strength and stamina, to
trust the truth that resonates

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:90%
within your inner being.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And know this-- prayer is power.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It changes your
life because you are

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
going to change the speed at
which you understand things.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:90%
You're clearing the fog.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.360 align:middle line:84%
These are examples from people
that I've actually worked with,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:90%
that I know.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.710 align:middle line:84%
The nature of your
soul is to give you

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:22.890 align:middle line:84%
instruction, is to speak
to you all the time.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:84%
For example, this
woman walks in,

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and she sensed something
was wrong with her son.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.423 align:middle line:90%
So naturally, she said in her--

00:15:31.423 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
I wonder what's
wrong with my son?

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.020 align:middle line:90%
And she instantly-- instantly--

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
her mind, her gut, she
got the impression.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.380 align:middle line:90%
He's on drugs.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.070 align:middle line:90%
He's seriously addicted.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.250 align:middle line:84%
She instantly,
intuitively, knew that--

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:90%
knew it.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:56.490 align:middle line:10%
But her heart didn't
want to know it.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.870 align:middle line:90%
It was too painful.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%
It was too painful.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So she chose-- the
fifth chakra's choice--

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
to make up a different
story, to say no, he's not.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.120 align:middle line:90%
He's just having a bad time.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Maybe he broke up
with his girlfriend.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't bear
to handle the truth.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.570 align:middle line:84%
So instead of taking
an intuitive hit--

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
and if she'd acted
on it right away,

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.880 align:middle line:90%
she could have saved his life.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But she didn't want
that to be the truth.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:90%
[SIREN BLARING]

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.500 align:middle line:84%
It was so overwhelming for
her that she immediately

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
routed it out of her heart
and back into her head

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:90%
and said, no.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's probably something
wrong at school.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So she separated her
head and her heart,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.240 align:middle line:90%
with devastating results.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:90%
And my heart broke for her.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:90%
It still does.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
This is where we remember
that life is not always

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.820 align:middle line:84%
fair or reasonable
for any of us.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.870 align:middle line:84%
What matters is how we respond
to these difficult situations

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.650 align:middle line:84%
when we find ourselves in
the midst of exactly such

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:90%
a conflict.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:84%
But we often forget the truth
that the wisest way to respond

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is to combine the power
of our intelligence

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.519 align:middle line:90%
and our emotional strength.

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:17.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:19.829 align:middle line:90%
How often do we do that?

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.140 align:middle line:90%
We get a hit.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
We know it's the truth.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:90%
But our heart can't bear it.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So we tell ourselves
that it's not the truth.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.510 align:middle line:84%
When I say we need

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:41.360 align:middle line:84%
is all about is this--
help me to deal with truth.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Help me because truth
changes my life.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:90%
Truth changes my life.

going to talk to each other.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:18:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And it means that your capacity
to see, sense, and feel

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
are going to work together
as a team, which makes

you a much more clear person.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Do you say a prayer--
help me handle truth?

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:17.580 align:middle line:84%
Help me because I won't
have the option of denial

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:90%
like I've had for a long time.

You need to know
what your values are.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.220 align:middle line:84%
I ask people these days
what their values are.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, the answers I
get are so outrageous.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:40.560 align:middle line:84%
It's not uncommon for me to
get an answer like, well,

People, convenience
is not a value.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Clarity is a value, devotion to
family, service to community,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
self-respect, and the
nurturing of your inner life.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.060 align:middle line:84%
These are the
values to consider.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Write down the ones
that resonate with you.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.970 align:middle line:84%
Consider the ones you feel
are the most challenging,

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and try implementing
them into your life.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I value that which serves life.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.670 align:middle line:90%
What are your values?

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
I value taking care of
the elders in my family.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.800 align:middle line:90%
What are your values?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Know your values.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.880 align:middle line:84%
I value truth, integrity, honor,
and I don't compromise them.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Live your values.

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:35.130 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know your values,
everything in the world

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.700 align:middle line:90%
can control you--

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.790 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
The slightest problem
out there will scare you

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.360 align:middle line:84%
because you don't
trust yourself.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:90%
You don't trust yourself.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what will get you
into deep spiritual crisis--

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.650 align:middle line:90%
the inability to trust yourself.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's just hit
a pause button here

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
and spend a second on that.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Do you trust yourself?

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:13.358 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual path is not
about doing yoga and breathing.

00:20:13.358 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do
that, that's great.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.010 align:middle line:90%
I do yoga.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But the spiritual path is
an excavation into you.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
It is about you finding
out what makes you tick.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
It's the journey
into self-knowledge.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It's about you excavating your
relationship to this truth.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.500 align:middle line:90%
What is the truth in you?

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Because if you can't
trust yourself,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.360 align:middle line:84%
nobody else will ever
be able to trust you.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And that is setting
yourself up for nothing

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
but one failed relationship in
life for the rest of your life.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's all rooted not in your
childhood but in the fact that

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.430 align:middle line:84%
you cannot keep your
word to yourself.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:90%
That is a true spiritual crisis.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you were
sitting here with me,

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
I would say we are going
to start with that.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.770 align:middle line:84%
We have to build you
from the bottom up,

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.190 align:middle line:84%
with giving yourself
your word and keeping it.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:84%
I made a promise to myself to
walk for 10 minutes every day.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And like William James said,
suffer not one exception.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
You begin by earning
your own respect.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is as much a part
of your spiritual path

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:90%
as anything else.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.220 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything you say is
an act of creation.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:84%
That becomes an
inner creed for you.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So become mindful--
mindful, mindful--

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.510 align:middle line:84%
of what you say
and why you say it.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.510 align:middle line:84%
It's not just what we say
to each other, it's why.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I
do to regulate myself is I

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:84%
ask myself, if this isn't
a positive contribution,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:90%
why am I doing it?

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:84%
Understanding why
you do something

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.720 align:middle line:84%
is crucial to know because you
are accountable to yourself

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and others for the quality
of person that you are.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of the day,
the only occupant of your life

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:90%
is you.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So I hold myself accountable
for why I do things,

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.650 align:middle line:90%
not just what I do.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
It's the why that
you learn from.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Govern the management
of your power.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Govern your power
very carefully.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the
greatest things

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.260 align:middle line:90%
I've learned in Buddhism.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.180 align:middle line:84%
Don't attach yourself
to spectacle.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Your power, your life force,
is the most precious substance.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Your soul, your power,
is precious goods.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:04.620 align:middle line:90%
Don't give it away.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.440 align:middle line:84%
Don't attach yourself
to something that has

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:90%
absolutely no value whatsoever.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:84%
You don't give yourself away
to decide that I don't like

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.510 align:middle line:90%
the tone of voice someone used.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:middle line:90%
That person insulted me.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And you attach to that, and
the next thing you know,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.980 align:middle line:90%
you're absolutely drained.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Because you gave
yourself to spectacles--

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.530 align:middle line:90%
spectacles.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And you are not
allowed to do that.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.750 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Even though it sounds
like it's easy, it's not.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:47.310 align:middle line:84%
When we are in the midst
and confronting a spectacle,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:84%
that spectacle can
look enormously

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:90%
like it's not a spectacle.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.270 align:middle line:84%
But I have to admit, I
am short-tempered when

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.400 align:middle line:84%
it comes to certain
things-- a lot of things.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.970 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to know
them all, but here's one.

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I get very short-tempered with,
and I'm very impatient around,

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:90%
slow drivers.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god, I'm so bad.

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think that every slow
driver is put there to annoy

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.480 align:middle line:90%
me, and especially if I'm late.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I think,
this is a setup

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.470 align:middle line:90%
to cause me to lose my temper.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:middle line:90%
And then I really go crazy.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And then I start driving
like I'm a crazy person.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.320 align:middle line:84%
And I can actually
feel my stamina start

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.270 align:middle line:90%
draining out of my body.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
have to tell myself,

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:84%
I am totally attaching
to the spectacle.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.040 align:middle line:84%
I lose it around
people who litter.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I am totally capable of
getting out of my car

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and going up to
people and practically

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
screaming in their face
if I see them litter.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I have to control myself and
not attach to that spectacle.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I now no longer get out
of my car and scream.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to clean up
twice as much because of that.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.760 align:middle line:90%
It's not my role.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.560 align:middle line:84%
There was once a time
when I was probably

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.270 align:middle line:90%
just that kind of litterbug.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not now.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sending a prayer
that that will somehow

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:90%
lighten their load.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:84%
I've taken a different
path, but I bless them

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.690 align:middle line:84%
in the act of cleaning
up something else.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.432 align:middle line:84%
I found a way to
make that positive.

00:25:33.432 --> 00:25:35.590 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
We have to mature our soul.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do has to
benefit all of us together.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:48.210 align:middle line:84%
I believe that's truly what a
collective spiritual path is

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.061 align:middle line:90%
all about.

00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:50.980 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.720 align:middle line:84%
We have cosmic-sized
problems these days.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we don't
have problems anymore.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Problems have solutions.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:90%
We actually have predicaments.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Predicaments don't
have solutions.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:08.670 align:middle line:90%
They take us along for the ride.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So we are living in a time
of cosmic predicaments.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:22.230 align:middle line:84%
It's also a time when the new
era of the nature of the divine

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:28.700 align:middle line:84%
is revealing itself through
us in biospiritual theology,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.550 align:middle line:90%
ecology, with us.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's calling us
all to, in a sense,

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:45.540 align:middle line:84%
convert the Earth into a
global ecological community

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.410 align:middle line:84%
monastery where all
of us help each other

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
to sustain life as
a global community.

As challenging as
it is sometimes

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.980 align:middle line:84%
to believe that you are a
powerful being, believe it.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:03.820 align:middle line:90%
Live it.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Trust that truth.

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:84%
The power we search
for these days

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:90%
is not outside of ourselves.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.310 align:middle line:90%
It truly is within us.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do and
say, feel and think,

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:84%
is an act of creation,
however small and invisible

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.130 align:middle line:90%
that act may be.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Never tell yourself that
you are helpless to change

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.070 align:middle line:84%
your life or the lives
of others or that you're

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:84%
incapable of making your
world a better place.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.810 align:middle line:84%
You were born to do
that in your own way.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'm not an idealist.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a pessimist.

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm a realist.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's going
to take a lot of work.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:49.970 align:middle line:84%
But I believe deeply in
the power of kindness

00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:54.270 align:middle line:84%
and the grace of
generosity, in the goodness

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.480 align:middle line:90%
that I know is in each person.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And I believe in the power
of your spiritual practice.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.620 align:middle line:84%
And I know that what is
in one is in the whole

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:13.320 align:middle line:84%
and that I owe you the best of
what's in me for that reason.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps that
truth will inspire

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:24.510 align:middle line:84%
