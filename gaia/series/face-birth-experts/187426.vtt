00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.660 align:middle line:84%
>> My name's Hannah Dahlen
and I'm Associate Professor

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.940 align:middle line:84%
of Midwifery at the
University of Western Sydney,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.880 align:middle line:84%
and I'm also the National Media
Spokesperson for the Australian

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.470 align:middle line:90%
College of Midwives.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And I did my midwifery
training in the UK,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and I came back to
Australia and embarked

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.990 align:middle line:84%
on a 20-year career in big, busy
tertiary referral hospitals,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.037 align:middle line:90%
mostly in delivery ward.

00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the last couple
of years, I've really

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
moved into academia, into
research and teaching,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:84%
but I've missed women
so much that I've now

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:84%
gone into private practice
as well as my other role

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.180 align:middle line:84%
and done a complete U-turn,
and I've actually gone back

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.070 align:middle line:84%
into the majority of the women
I care for having home births,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:90%
which is lovely.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.590 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
We definitely have rising
fear around childbirth,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.577 align:middle line:84%
and there's plenty of
research to show that.

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:47.160 align:middle line:84%
There's also research
to show the more

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.660 align:middle line:84%
intervention there
is in childbirth,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.970 align:middle line:90%
the more fear there is.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.637 align:middle line:84%
So we often blame women and
we say women are more fearful,

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.220 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's actually time
to look at the health providers

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and how we're generating
fear, and the language

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.440 align:middle line:84%
we use with women,
the environments

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
that we provide care in can
all generate enormous fear.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.860 align:middle line:84%
If you look at how a midwife
will present statistics

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.722 align:middle line:84%
to how an obstetrician will,
midwives very much talk about--

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
you know, if you're
talking about one in 1,000,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.097 align:middle line:84%
obstetrician will say, one in
1,000 chance your baby dies,

00:01:16.097 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
all as a woman you hear is
I'm the one, whereas a midwife

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:84%
takes the attitude of,
well, 999 times out of 1,000

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.600 align:middle line:90%
nothing's going to happen.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.515 align:middle line:84%
So same statistics-- very,
very different impact

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:30.045 align:middle line:90%
at where you put your emphasis.

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.850 align:middle line:84%
We have a very limited view
about safety in maternity care.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, it's live
baby and live mother.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course,
those are ultimately

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:90%
the most important thing.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:90%
But they're not the only thing.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And when we focus
so much on what

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
I call the tip of the
iceberg in this situation,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
we actually often ignore
great underlying dangers

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:90%
that we don't address.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.040 align:middle line:84%
For example, cultural
safety, emotional safety,

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:84%
psychological, spiritual
safety are not addressed.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that postpartum
depression is rising.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We know that suicide
is one of the leading

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
causes of maternal
death in this country.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.110 align:middle line:90%
That's not safe care.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
That is a very big
worry that we are

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.520 align:middle line:84%
creating a society
that's actually

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:90%
increasing women's distress.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
These women are also becoming
the mothers of the future,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and they are
mothering children who

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
are more likely
to be traumatized

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:84%
and are more likely to
end up with our society

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:90%
not being a better place.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to take our eyes
off the tip of the iceberg

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and start to look
underneath at all

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of the other drivers of
morbidity and of well-being

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:90%
that we are not addressing.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
So women are often in situations
where they lack support.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:90%
They may have mental illness.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.940 align:middle line:90%
They may have drug use.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And what do we do?

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
We bring them into
our hospitals.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:90%
We check their tummies.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.000 align:middle line:90%
We check their blood pressures.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:90%
We check their urine.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:90%
We send them home.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not actually addressing
the most important aspect here,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:84%
which is, what is the
distress going on?

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.450 align:middle line:90%
What is the support structure?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.990 align:middle line:84%
How can we put into
place things and people

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.260 align:middle line:84%
to make this experience
more pleasant for the woman

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
and provide her with
support with mothering?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:84%
So, in fact, we
address everything

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.790 align:middle line:84%
about her physically, and the
greatest issue in the room

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is never addressed, and that's
the issue that kills her.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So we have got to, as health
professionals, realize

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
when we deal with childbirth,
the biggest organ involved

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.600 align:middle line:84%
in birth is the brain, and
we so often forget the brain.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the key things that makes
birth go well is relationships,

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and relationships breed trust,
and where trust is, fear isn't.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple kind
of correlation.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So with partnerships with
women that midwives form

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
during continuity of care,
what midwives actually

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
do is build up an
environment of trust,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.120 align:middle line:84%
build up a partnership where
women's true potential can

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.060 align:middle line:84%
come out, where
women can actually

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.650 align:middle line:84%
do what they're very
beautifully designed to do,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.230 align:middle line:84%
which is give birth
to their baby.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So all of our research
tells us continuity of care

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:84%
is a totally magic sort of
supporting structure that

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.180 align:middle line:90%
enables birth to function best.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.029 align:middle line:84%
And I've often said, if
pharmaceutical companies could

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:84%
develop a tablet that
was continuity of care,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:84%
they would be
absolute millionaires.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:84%
But continuity care is
midwifery, and midwifery sits

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.440 align:middle line:84%
within a whole
political agenda that

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.860 align:middle line:84%
constantly means that
society battles against that.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's not
just about continuity

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
because you can
have continuity care

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
from a medical
professional and they

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
will take a very
medical attitude

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.720 align:middle line:84%
and still very much see you as
a belly, a baby, blood pressure,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Continuity care from a midwifery
perspective is a social model,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and that involves, how
are you going as a person?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It involves listening
a lot, talking a lot.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
It involves empowering women.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.055 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you can do this.

00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Your body is
designed to do this.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
It involves women
actually helping women

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.630 align:middle line:90%
to believe in themselves.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So the approach that midwives
take in continuity of care

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.700 align:middle line:90%
is a social model.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
The approach often taken in
medical continuity of care

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.713 align:middle line:90%
is a medicalized model.

00:05:11.713 --> 00:05:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So they are very
different things.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.200 align:middle line:84%
People have this assumption
that birth in a hospital is safe

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:90%
and it's as safe as it gets.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've got a
problem, birth in a hospital

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
is the best place
to have the birth.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:84%
It is definitely safe,
and hospitals are

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:90%
fantastic when we got issues.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you're a low-risk
woman, healthy pregnancy,

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
you walk into the doors
of our institutions,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
what you do is you embark on
a cascade that often takes you

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
in a direction you
never anticipated.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:90%
You arrive.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Midwife puts you on a bed.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.870 align:middle line:84%
She puts a monitor
on your belly.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.950 align:middle line:90%
She examines you.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:90%
She takes your blood pressure.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
She finds something
going on in the monitor.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a deviation
on the trace.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.900 align:middle line:90%
The monitor never comes off.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.317 align:middle line:84%
Now you're really uncomfortable
because you're on the bed.

00:05:58.317 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:90%
You need pain relief.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.730 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have an epidural.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Now you're going to need a drip.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Now you're going
to need a catheter.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
Now you're never, ever going
to get off that monitor.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, we progress.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:90%
You labor slows down.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.123 align:middle line:90%
Now you need oxytocin.

00:06:10.123 --> 00:06:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Now you get to second stage.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
You can't push because
you can't feel.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:90%
So now we get the forceps out.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.053 align:middle line:90%
Now we cut the episiotomy.

00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:19.720 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly you've got
a baby in your arms.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.360 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you're alive
and the baby's alive,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.040 align:middle line:84%
but has that been
a good experience,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.170 align:middle line:84%
and did it need to
happen that way?

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And our research would tell
us that, no, it didn't.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.140 align:middle line:84%
There were things that happened
at the beginning that took you

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:84%
down that line,
and we need to stop

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
funneling women down this
huge cascade of intervention.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:84%
Women who choose
home birth often

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
have a different
philosophical framework

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.415 align:middle line:84%
to women who choose
hospital birth.

00:06:46.415 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And we've just finished
a study looking

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
at the choices around vaginal
birth after cesarean section.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And what became
really clear is women

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.180 align:middle line:84%
who chose to have vaginal
birth after cesarean

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
came from what we called
a mother birth framework.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Their philosophy was
what's good for me

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and makes me healthy and
happy is good for my baby

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.400 align:middle line:90%
because I will mother better.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.500 align:middle line:84%
The women who chose
repeat cesarean often

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
came from a childbirth
framework, which

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.960 align:middle line:84%
was my job as a good mother
is to sacrifice myself

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:90%
for my baby.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Society very much
sits on the side

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.650 align:middle line:84%
of the childbirth framework
and says good mothers

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:90%
sacrifice themselves.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Women who say strong
mothers, empowered mothers,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.830 align:middle line:84%
powerful mothers,
and healthy mothers

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:84%
are good mothers often
shout into this world that

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.930 align:middle line:90%
does not understand them.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.400 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it makes such sense.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.830 align:middle line:84%
The hand that rocks the
cradle rules the world.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.750 align:middle line:84%
If that hand is sad, if
that hand is damaged,

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
then the product that
steps from that cradle

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
will be damaged and will be
sad and will shape our society

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.620 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have got to get to
grips with the different ways

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:90%
that we look at childbirth.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.770 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.400 align:middle line:84%
At home, it is so
totally different.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I almost can't explain
how different it is.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.470 align:middle line:90%
The environment is the woman's.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Her furniture, her room, her
smells, her food, her partner,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:84%
her family, they're all
something familiar with.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.840 align:middle line:84%
At home, we stay
almost under the radar.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:90%
We creep quietly in the shadows.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:90%
We whisper.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
We treat that home almost like
a beautiful cathedral in Europe,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:84%
with awe and reverence,
very different to how

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:90%
it is in hospital.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.170 align:middle line:90%
She is in her own space.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:90%
She is relaxed.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:90%
She feels loved and comfortable.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.870 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, she does
not release adrenaline.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.010 align:middle line:84%
She releases this wonderful
flow of oxytocin and endorphins.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:84%
She is now in the zone, as we
call her, completely blissed

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
out, getting on with it,
not distressed in labor.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:90%
She gives birth.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.340 align:middle line:90%
She pushes that baby out.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
That baby is brought up
onto her belly by herself.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.737 align:middle line:84%
That baby is now wide
eyed with catecholamines

00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:90%
racing through its system.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.020 align:middle line:90%
It's so engaged.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:90%
It's got dilated pupils.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.460 align:middle line:90%
It's mouthing around.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And the two of them, with
this incredible cocktail

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.890 align:middle line:84%
of hormones, are just falling
in love and connected.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
There's no, what do I do with
my baby, what do you think,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.270 align:middle line:90%
is everything OK, none of that.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:84%
It's just completely
the two of them

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.330 align:middle line:84%
in their little world with,
often, their partner there.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
So different in hospital
where often there's fear.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:90%
There's shouting.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.250 align:middle line:90%
There's screaming.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.450 align:middle line:90%
Babies come out roaring.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
I often see at home birth these
babies hardly make a sound.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:84%
They cry very, very
softly or they just look.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
So the whole kind of pool
of how home birth works

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
in releasing those hormones,
in stopping the fear,

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in making sure that
everything just progresses on

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
in that amazing
rhythm, completely

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:84%
different than putting a
woman in a foreign environment

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
with foreign people,
with strangers, with

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.690 align:middle line:84%
smell she doesn't understand,
with bright lights

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:90%
and banging doors.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
At home, because there's
nothing else interrupting--

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.840 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
else interfering.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.765 align:middle line:84%
You haven't got synthetic
hormones going on.

00:09:55.765 --> 00:09:57.140 align:middle line:84%
You haven't got
an induced labor.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
You haven't got an
epiduralized woman.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
What you see is
birth flowing along

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.830 align:middle line:90%
in an incredibly natural way.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The moment something goes
wrong or starts to deviate,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
it's so obvious that
often what happens

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
is it's the tiny
ripple in the water

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:84%
you can see so clearly
because everything's so calm

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
and in process, that you
actually step in at that point

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:90%
and you transfer.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.328 align:middle line:84%
So before you end
up with a tsunami,

00:10:22.328 --> 00:10:23.870 align:middle line:84%
you've gone in
already because you've

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.230 align:middle line:84%
seen the ripple, whereas in
hospital we're chugging along

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.568 align:middle line:84%
and the baby's trace is
getting a little bit worse,

00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:31.610 align:middle line:90%
but everyone's out there.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.200 align:middle line:90%
I can call them at any moment.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.220 align:middle line:90%
We monitor babies to death.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.000 align:middle line:84%
We often do things
because we know

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.100 align:middle line:84%
everyone's out there
that we don't respond.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So I would actually
say home birth is safer

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.470 align:middle line:84%
because we respond early
and we can see clearly

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.973 align:middle line:90%
when there's a problem.

00:10:46.973 --> 00:10:48.890 align:middle line:84%
In hospital, we're doing
so many other things.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:84%
We no longer know what's
normal, and sometimes we

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.380 align:middle line:84%
don't see when labor
actually deviates

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.570 align:middle line:90%
from normal to the abnormal.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
I think the fundamental
fact is home

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:84%
is the safest place to be
when everything's going right.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Hospital is the safest place to
be when things are going wrong.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the response
to that shouldn't

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.760 align:middle line:84%
be, let's put everybody that's
going right into a hospital

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.220 align:middle line:84%
in case something goes
wrong, but it should be let's

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:84%
set up systems that
are responsive.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's make sure our
midwives are skilled.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Let's make sure we
have processes in

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.500 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
women who need help

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.210 align:middle line:84%
are in hospital
when they need it

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.252 align:middle line:84%
and that women are
not in hospital

00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:29.960 align:middle line:84%
if they don't need to
be there because we

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.690 align:middle line:84%
are constantly stuffing
normal up that way as well.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.390 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
It's very clear when it comes
to the home birth debate

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.350 align:middle line:84%
that science is politicized, and
that is a real big, big problem

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.850 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
hard for consumers

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.660 align:middle line:84%
to make any sense
of the statistics,

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.660 align:middle line:84%
that professionals seem
to look at one paper

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and come out with two
different responses.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
So my attitude to this has been
you cannot just talk about home

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:90%
birth as one group.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to divide this up
into three considerations.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.270 align:middle line:84%
The first is, what
are the outcomes

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.640 align:middle line:84%
for women who are low risk in
pregnancy and have well babies?

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.730 align:middle line:90%
They're fantastic.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:84%
Those outcomes
show us that there

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
are no difference in
outcomes for the baby,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.140 align:middle line:84%
for women who are low
risk in hospital-- mothers

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.400 align:middle line:84%
much better outcomes,
much less intervention.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.575 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's one
group of statistics.

00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:84%
The second group of statistics,
which is often bundled up

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.990 align:middle line:84%
with the first, is,
well, what about women

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:90%
who are moderate or high risk?

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know the
risk is increased.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:84%
We know that there
are a greater chance

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.250 align:middle line:84%
of babies dying and of
complications for the mother

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
and baby.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.340 align:middle line:90%
So we know that.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.270 align:middle line:84%
The third consideration, though,
is, OK, regardless of that,

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:84%
does a woman have
the right to make

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.990 align:middle line:84%
a decision about
where she gives birth

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.520 align:middle line:90%
and what happens to her body?

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.760 align:middle line:84%
The law's on her side in
almost every country on Earth.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So what we erroneously
do in this debate

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.643 align:middle line:84%
is bundle them all
up in together.

00:12:51.643 --> 00:12:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Look at studies
that have included

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.610 align:middle line:84%
both low risk and high risk
and go, the rate of death

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.050 align:middle line:90%
is three times as great.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, the rate of death
is three times as great

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.280 align:middle line:84%
when you include
those high-risk women.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Remove them, look at only
low risk, and, guess what,

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:90%
it's no different.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.800 align:middle line:84%
So our political agendas allow
us to hand pick the evidence

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.540 align:middle line:84%
to support our
political beliefs,

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is very irresponsible
when we are actually

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
supposed to be
putting forth balanced

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.075 align:middle line:90%
information to consumers.

00:13:19.075 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
A study that's
often talked about

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
by Australian obstetricians
is the Bastian study,

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
which was undertaken
back in the '80s.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at all
home births for a period,

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and they found an increased
perinatal mortality.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
However, there were lots of twin
births, breech births in that.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:84%
When they took them out,
there was no difference

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
between the perinatal mortality
between home and hospital.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
However, very irresponsibly,
obstetricians have always

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.965 align:middle line:90%
gone on with the statistic.

00:13:41.965 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's three times as risky.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.550 align:middle line:84%
Since then, we've had very
large home births study

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:84%
from the Netherlands, over
500,000 women giving birth

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:84%
there, low-risk
women with midwives--

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:84%
no difference in perinatal
mortality to giving birth

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:55.490 align:middle line:90%
in hospital.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.740 align:middle line:84%
We've had the Canadian
study showing midwives

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
caring for women at home and
in hospital-- no difference

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
in perinatal outcome in
home compared to hospital.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:84%
We've had the US study
showing over 5,000 births

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:90%
at home, low risk--

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:10.910 align:middle line:84%
no difference in
perinatal outcome,

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:84%
far better outcomes
for mom and baby.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.260 align:middle line:84%
But we've also had
some studies coming out

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.830 align:middle line:90%
where they've mixed the risk.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.520 align:middle line:84%
So we've had a study coming
out of the UK, which had

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.278 align:middle line:90%
twins and breaches included.

00:14:21.278 --> 00:14:23.570 align:middle line:84%
We've had a study coming out
from South Australia that,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:84%
again, had high-risk
women involved.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, when you remove the
high-risk women and only

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:84%
looked at the low
risk, no difference.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Add the high risk, yes,
there is increased risk.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.260 align:middle line:90%
This isn't rocket science.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:90%
It makes total sense.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:middle line:84%
If your pregnancy is
normal and low risk,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.630 align:middle line:90%
then home is totally safe.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.250 align:middle line:84%
If there are added
risks, then home

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.120 align:middle line:84%
is not often the best
place to be physically.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But some women may
feel mentally at ease.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And then we come to the
third part of the debate--

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.880 align:middle line:84%
do women have the
right to make a choice?

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:90%


00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:84%
It's very clear to
me, evidence is not

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:01.130 align:middle line:84%
going to end this debate,
because, actually, the home

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.810 align:middle line:84%
birth debate is about
more than safety.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
It's about more than
perinatal mortality.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.360 align:middle line:84%
The home birth debate cuts to
the core of many very, very

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:90%
deep issues in our society.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:84%
It's about women's agency
and right to choose.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.190 align:middle line:90%
It's about midwifery autonomy.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.960 align:middle line:90%
It's about trust in birth.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.200 align:middle line:84%
It's about belief in
maximization of physiology.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's about the absence
of the obstetric gaze.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Get down to the bottom
line, and home birth

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.870 align:middle line:84%
threatens all of our
deeply held beliefs

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
around this in childbirth.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So evidence is not
going to end the debate.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.740 align:middle line:84%
One way to possibly
end the debate--

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.860 align:middle line:84%
and it's something that I've
been writing about recently--

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.912 align:middle line:84%
is to get
collaboration happening

00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
between the different
groups-- that

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.210 align:middle line:84%
is, the obstetricians, the
midwives, and the consumers.

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And we all have to hold
each other accountable

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:55.080 align:middle line:84%
for coming out with
evidence-based guidelines that

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.810 align:middle line:84%
balance the evidence
and make sure that we

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:59.190 align:middle line:90%
present all sides of it.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, the UK's done this
enormously successful

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.290 align:middle line:84%
and come out with a home birth
position statement that says,

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
home birth for low-risk women
is great and has benefits.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only way they ever
could get to that position

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.092 align:middle line:84%
is to have obstetricians,
midwives, and consumers

00:16:12.092 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
at the table.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.458 align:middle line:84%
Every other major medical
and midwifery organization

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in the world has got their
separate statements standing

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
on either side of the fence
shouting at each other.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So I actually believe
collaboration and consensus

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.980 align:middle line:84%
statement is the
way we need to head

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
to get past of
what is essentially

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:90%
a belief polarization in this.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.950 align:middle line:84%
I've often said
that there's been

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
an eerie silence
from the feminists

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.120 align:middle line:84%
on the issue of
childbirth and women's

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.800 align:middle line:90%
rights around childbirth.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And I think that stems
from this concern

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.390 align:middle line:84%
that if we associate
women with birth,

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.220 align:middle line:84%
we pull them back
to the home, we

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.010 align:middle line:84%
pull them back out of all of the
advancements that we've made.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a very sad comment

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.150 align:middle line:84%
because never before
in history have we

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.710 align:middle line:90%
been able to have it all.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And yet, there's an
aspect of our lives

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.180 align:middle line:84%
that is being
destroyed every day

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and is not allowing us to become
the very strong women that we

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:03.720 align:middle line:90%
could be.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.762 align:middle line:90%
We can be strong mothers.

00:17:04.762 --> 00:17:06.270 align:middle line:90%
We can be strong business women.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:90%
We can be strong wives.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.420 align:middle line:84%
We can be strong
in so many areas.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.369 align:middle line:84%
So feminism, I
think, has got a lot

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to answer for because
they have been

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:84%
terribly silent on childbirth,
and it's time to wake up.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.339 align:middle line:84%
And I actually think there is
a rising awareness that this

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
is a huge not only feminist
issue but a human's rights

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:26.730 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And I've been quite struck with
what has happened in the US

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
with the rising numbers
of babies dying in the US.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.690 align:middle line:84%
The maternal mortality now
sits at 42nd in the world.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
For the first time ever
that I can remember,

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Amnesty International
has got involved

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
in the childbirth debate and has
made huge protest around what

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:90%
is happening in childbirth.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
So the human rights sort
of revolution is starting.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
The feminists need to
wake up and get mad.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time we
burnt our bras again,

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and we need to make
strong statements,

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and we need to reclaim
motherhood for the power

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.810 align:middle line:84%
that it can give
women and the rights

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:84%
for us to control our
bodies in regards to this.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.720 align:middle line:84%
The argument from the feminists
around pain relief is often,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.240 align:middle line:84%
will women have the
right not to feel pain?

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.260 align:middle line:90%
They do.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
They absolutely
do, and we've never

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.920 align:middle line:84%
lived in a better time
for that to happen.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.080 align:middle line:84%
However, women
also have the right

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to know the consequences
of pain relief

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.030 align:middle line:84%
not only for themselves
but for their babies.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
Women also have
the right to have

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.830 align:middle line:84%
great support and
empowerment and alternative

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
ways of handling their pain so
that when they do need the pain

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
relief because something's
going wrong, it is effective

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:90%
and it is appropriate.

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So it isn't so much saying women
shouldn't have pain relief,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.460 align:middle line:84%
but what women should
have is support

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and the right environment
to facilitate physiology for

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.430 align:middle line:90%
as long as that is normal.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.110 align:middle line:84%
When pain is
abnormal, pain relief

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
is exactly what
women should have.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.230 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.540 align:middle line:84%
A famous line from
Saint Augustine

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.470 align:middle line:84%
is, "Give me other mothers and
I'll give you another world."

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, I hate to disagree with a
saint, but I've reframed that.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Give me another world, and
I'll give you other mothers.

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
It's time to stop blaming women
for the outcomes of motherhood

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
in the world that we
give them, and it's

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:84%
time for us to create safe,
trusting, empowered worlds so

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:84%
that mothers can step
from that experience

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.430 align:middle line:84%
and become the
strong mothers that

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.290 align:middle line:90%
shape the future of the world.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.028 align:middle line:84%
We see often the
baby as a product,

00:19:29.028 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and we see the mother
as almost this vessel

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.380 align:middle line:90%
that just carries the product.

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.520 align:middle line:84%
If we do not invest in women,
we have no hope with the product

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:84%
because the product is
a direct result of how

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:42.580 align:middle line:84%
our women are cared for,
nurtured, empowered,

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.600 align:middle line:84%
and they then become the
people who actually produce

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and nurture our future society.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have got to start
investing in women,

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.470 align:middle line:84%
not always blaming
them for when things

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.705 align:middle line:84%
go wrong with the baby, which we
often view as the product that

00:19:56.705 --> 00:19:57.505 align:middle line:90%
is our focus.

00:19:57.505 --> 00:20:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.860 align:middle line:84%
In the past five years,
we've seen the beginnings

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.720 align:middle line:84%
of publicly funded
home birth, which

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.090 align:middle line:90%
runs out of a hospital system.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So we now have two
options for women, one

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.955 align:middle line:84%
privately funded
private home birth

00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:84%
with a private midwife and
the other publicly funded home

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:90%
birth.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:90%
We need both.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.090 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because women
who choose publicly funded home

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.632 align:middle line:84%
birth are women who would have
never before thought of a home

00:20:22.632 --> 00:20:25.380 align:middle line:84%
birth because they do like
the system and the security

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
of the system, but
in their relationship

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.930 align:middle line:84%
with their midwives and having
the option there available

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:84%
from the system, they go,
hey, I might give that a try.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So we have to really
support both ways

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:84%
because there are women now
experiencing home birth that

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.660 align:middle line:84%
never would have before,
and we need to make sure

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.160 align:middle line:84%
that women who want
to experience it

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.300 align:middle line:84%
with private midwives continue
to be able to access that.
