00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Sheila Kitzinger, and
I'm a social anthropologist

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.110 align:middle line:90%
of birth.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.510 align:middle line:90%
There aren't many of us around.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.640 align:middle line:84%
I study women's experiences
in different cultures

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.440 align:middle line:84%
all round the world
and how they're treated

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.960 align:middle line:84%
and how the system, the
medical system works,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and how women feel about birth,
and how it affects their lives.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.640 align:middle line:84%
I also teach prenatal
classes and work

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:90%
with women and couples.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:84%
In England, I was the first
to introduce couples classes.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And they'd come and sit
on my sitting room carpet

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and talk about feelings, the
men as well as the women,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
not just about whether
you should huff and puff

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.340 align:middle line:84%
at this point or hold
your breath like mad.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to treat
birth as a competitive sport

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.970 align:middle line:84%
for which you have to do
all sorts of exercises.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's certainly
how it was in France

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.787 align:middle line:84%
when I started teaching,
which was quite

00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
different from the
Dick-Read approach, which

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
was about the barriers
created by fear of childbirth.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But the French stuff
was all very organized.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And women were in
competition with each other

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.637 align:middle line:84%
about what they could
do, and how quickly they

00:01:22.637 --> 00:01:24.470 align:middle line:84%
could push a baby out,
and whether they were

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:90%
using all the right muscles.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So I got very critical of that
particular approach to birth.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
worked with midwives.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I do a lot of
teaching of midwives

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and indeed some teaching
of doctors and write books.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.630 align:middle line:90%
I think I've written 24 books.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.820 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't think one
could write that much

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.410 align:middle line:84%
perhaps about this
subject, but there

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.070 align:middle line:84%
are all sorts of aspects of it
and breastfeeding of course,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
too, and the misery of
childbirth for some women

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:84%
and how they feel afterwards
compared with the joy

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.677 align:middle line:90%
that they can also feel

00:01:58.677 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Why do you do it?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm inspired by what I do.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't ever want
to retire because it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.660 align:middle line:84%
seems to me that birth
has given me so much.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And I want to use that inner
dynamism, that energy that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
comes from having been
blessed with wonderful births.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.090 align:middle line:84%
I'd had a wonderful
experience, a home birth.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And it seemed to me so awful
that all women couldn't

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:84%
have an experience like
mine and come out of birth

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:90%
feeling really positive.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:90%
And so that's when I started.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And well, now, I'm 81, so
you can sort of work it out.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.720 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I think the most important
elements for the mother

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.600 align:middle line:84%
and the baby in the
birth experience

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is that the woman feels
enriched and empowered to make

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
her own decisions and
comes out able to mother.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And mothering is-- it
demands a lot, mothering.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to learn from
the baby and indeed

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
learn from the child right
through the child's life

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
until the child is
adult and after.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think also
it's very important

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:27.810 align:middle line:84%
that you find your own way and
don't rely on books and rules.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.370 align:middle line:84%
It is important to learn on
this transition to motherhood.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.250 align:middle line:84%
And having a baby is a
bridge to motherhood.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.480 align:middle line:84%
We have to be able to learn
how to walk confidently

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.280 align:middle line:90%
on that bridge.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.600 align:middle line:84%
There is absolutely no evidence
that when there is a good care

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.830 align:middle line:84%
system, home birth is any more
dangerous than hospital birth.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:middle line:90%
In fact, rather the opposite.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go
into hospital, you

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:84%
are very likely
to have all sorts

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:90%
of semi-routine interventions.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And many of these
interventions can be dangerous,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.490 align:middle line:84%
like induction of labor,
for example, using drugs,

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
especially if the cervix
is not already ripe.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.520 align:middle line:90%
And this often happens.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you're more likely
to have a Cesarean section

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
or a vaginally-assisted
delivery because induction leads

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.010 align:middle line:84%
to problems with the
uterus and also above all

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:90%
to clock-watched labor.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And we don't clock
watch, I don't know,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:84%
hyacinths coming up
through the ground.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't clock watch
everything else in nature.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:84%
But birth is
treated in hospitals

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
as if it weren't
supposed to be natural,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.440 align:middle line:84%
as if it's something that
has to be managed minutely.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, each woman
is different anyway.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.347 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's a
tremendous fear of childbirth.

00:04:54.347 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
The culture of
fear in childbirth

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:84%
has been around a long
time because certainly

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Victorian women were
very frightened of birth.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Although sometimes, they had
extremely large families--

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:90%
8, 9, 10 children.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:84%
But the intervention that
started when doctors took over

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.530 align:middle line:90%
from midwives--

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
and that really was
beginning way back

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.030 align:middle line:84%
in the last century for
women who were middle class

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.730 align:middle line:84%
and could afford to
pay for a doctor--

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that this
has meant that birth

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
has been seen as
an ordeal, rather

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
than a challenge and a joy
in which you can express

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:90%
yourself and have a baby.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.730 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Interventions, obstetric
interventions, and indeed

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
even midwifery interventions,
such as saying you've

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.640 align:middle line:84%
got to get lie on
the bed, or saying,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.438 align:middle line:84%
push, come on now, mother, push,
hold your breath and push--

00:05:59.438 --> 00:06:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.450 align:middle line:90%
these are interventions.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of these can lead
to interruption, in fact,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.650 align:middle line:84%
really taking over
normal labor so

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.470 align:middle line:90%
that birth is made unnatural.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And the woman
doesn't get a chance

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.170 align:middle line:84%
to express herself
spontaneously through her body.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:84%
This in turn affects the
baby because a baby isn't

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
an isolated little package, or
it certainly isn't like a doll

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
that you pick up, and then look
after, and change its dresses,

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
and wash it, and then
put it down when you're

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.210 align:middle line:90%
no longer interested in it.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.870 align:middle line:84%
A baby is a human being
already with some personality

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.040 align:middle line:90%
able to express itself.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing
with birth too

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:84%
is that you reach out
your arms to greet

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.630 align:middle line:84%
this new person with whom
you are in a relationship.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.730 align:middle line:90%
You learn from each other.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And you speak a language
which is not yet

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.780 align:middle line:84%
in words, which is in all
sorts of sounds and touch.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning of
the great adventure of life

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.510 align:middle line:84%
and the basis of
education for society

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
for being able to
care for other people,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.900 align:middle line:84%
and relate to other
people, and respond

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.690 align:middle line:90%
in a way that is harmonious.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.410 align:middle line:84%
We know that we actually
impose a challenge

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:84%
on babies when they're not able
to communicate early at birth.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:39.490 align:middle line:84%
For example, we know that
after having a lot of drugs,

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.530 align:middle line:84%
a baby may find
it very difficult

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.890 align:middle line:84%
to relate to the mother
and to breastfeed.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:84%
The baby may not
come to the breast

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:84%
spontaneously and grip
the breast with open mouth

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.110 align:middle line:84%
like a flower around
the bud inside.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And a baby may then have
difficulties feeding.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And that may be the start of a
whole lot of other difficulties

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:90%
in behavior.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the mother responds
thinking she's a rotten mother.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:90%
She can't even feed her baby.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.380 align:middle line:90%
And she hasn't got enough milk.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.730 align:middle line:90%
And she may blame the baby.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:90%
She may blame herself.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.400 align:middle line:90%
She may blame both.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we're looking
at is looked at in terms

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.860 align:middle line:90%
of social relationships--

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:90%
behavior.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
We are actually imposing a
problem which needn't be there.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:37.500 align:middle line:84%
Women are not told usually that
interventions in childbirth

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
can affect
psychological outcomes,

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
can affect the interaction
between the mother

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and the baby.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:90%
And that is a big omission.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.740 align:middle line:84%
It is treated usually as if
this is peripheral and rather

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:58.350 align:middle line:84%
flimsy information and that
we're sort of new age hippies

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.810 align:middle line:84%
if we're interested
in it at all.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet the way you
think about other people

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and relate to other people
is basic to our existence

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.560 align:middle line:90%
and to the creation of society.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.730 align:middle line:84%
I think women are
not being told this

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
because we treat
birth as something

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.110 align:middle line:84%
that has to be
managed and that has

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:90%
to have a system imposed on it.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And women who are interested in
doing other things, in singing

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.710 align:middle line:84%
during birth, or dancing during
birth, or simply having a baby

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.200 align:middle line:84%
at home, they really are very
irresponsible like children

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.282 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:09:38.282 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And you can't let them
get away with that

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:90%
because they can harm the baby.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:90%
They can harm themselves.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It's really that women
are treated as if they're

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.130 align:middle line:90%
utterly irresponsible.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And I see this as a matter of
discrimination against women.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.800 align:middle line:90%
What if something goes wrong?

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Yes, of course, just as when
we cross the street and there's

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.260 align:middle line:90%
traffic.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Anything can go
wrong in childbirth.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But good care during
pregnancy and preparation

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.690 align:middle line:84%
for birth with women
knowing their options

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and having the information for
this makes birth much safer.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important if a woman has a home

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.730 align:middle line:84%
birth that she
knows how she could

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
get to hospital, for example,
without a long period

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.570 align:middle line:84%
of waiting for an ambulance
or delaying things

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.690 align:middle line:84%
when there was some urgency
in getting to hospital.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:84%
There must always be the
option of having intervention,

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.780 align:middle line:84%
but it shouldn't
be a first resort.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Because there are many ways--
and I learn this as I go around

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
the world working with women
in traditional societies--

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.480 align:middle line:84%
there are many ways of dealing
with problems that often we

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.770 align:middle line:84%
are not aware of
in our own society.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:04.530 align:middle line:84%
like getting women
up and again dancing,

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:10.360 align:middle line:84%
and using rocking movements
of the pelvis to get

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:84%
the baby rotated into
the correct position

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and with a head down
ready for birth.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
I'm fascinated when
I see these things

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and listen to midwives
talking about what

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:84%
they do when they're faced
with challenges like this.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:90%
Birth is a dance.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.000 align:middle line:90%
And we often don't realize this.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
in one society.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Or was it Fiji?

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I think it was.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Where I was interviewing a local
midwife, a traditional midwife.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you interview
in these societies,

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
you don't just
interview one person.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's interested.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So there were lots of
other women standing around

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.560 align:middle line:90%
and children.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And they were listening
very carefully

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to what she was saying
and what I was asking.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her some
questions about what

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:84%
would happen if things
aren't straightforward.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And she struggled to
find an answer which

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:24.088 align:middle line:84%
would fit with her idea of how
nontraditional midwives would

00:12:24.088 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
cope in the hospital, and what
would they do in the hospital.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.310 align:middle line:84%
She was trying very hard to
tell me the hospital rules.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:34.000 align:middle line:84%
And when she'd
done it, the women

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.230 align:middle line:84%
all shouted out, no,
we don't do that.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.315 align:middle line:84%
And they started to
show what they did do.

00:12:41.315 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was to dance.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And they started.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.390 align:middle line:90%
I joined in.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:47.835 align:middle line:90%
The kids joined in.

00:12:47.835 --> 00:12:48.835 align:middle line:90%
And we were all dancing.

00:12:48.835 --> 00:12:52.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:84%
In our Western society, children
don't learn very much usually

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.800 align:middle line:84%
from their mothers
or other people.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.980 align:middle line:84%
What they learn about
is from television.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And you only have to switch
on a television program,

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.670 align:middle line:84%
either a serious one which
is giving scientific stuff

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:19.390 align:middle line:84%
about birth or any of the
marvelous serial programs

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:84%
in which a woman is, for
example, giving birth

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
in the back of a taxi
because she didn't leave

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.340 align:middle line:90%
for the hospital soon enough.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And people are leaning over her
trying to deliver over her leg.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's amazing how many women
on television in these comedy

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
programs don't make it
to hospital in time.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And terrible things result.
This is what children learn.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
You talk to any child
about what they've

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
seen on television
about birth, and you'll

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.600 align:middle line:90%
get information like this.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:90%
This-- this is how they learn.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:90%
This is what they learn.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:84%
It's perfectly
possible for a woman

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to have a safe birth
in hospital if the rule

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.320 align:middle line:84%
is that you are aiming for
a normal birth and a birth

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.730 align:middle line:90%
without intervention.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And increasingly,
this is happening,

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:14.160 align:middle line:84%
which is good, even in our
local hospital in Oxford, which

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
is a good hospital but which
is extremely high tech.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:23.100 align:middle line:84%
There is no ruling that there
should be non-interference

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:84%
until it is very obvious that
something has to be done.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
make birth much safer

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.160 align:middle line:84%
because it's this business
of one intervention leading

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to another like
dominoes falling.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
Once you start, you don't know
where you're going to stop.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.110 align:middle line:84%
And it probably will be
with a Cesarean section.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, you
have all the risks that

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:90%
come with Cesarean sections.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult to make--

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.770 align:middle line:90%
to talk statistics there.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But cesarean section is
probably about three times

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:03.300 align:middle line:84%
as dangerous for a woman as a
straightforward vaginal birth.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And these statistics
are obviously

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:84%
collected in different ways
and in different places.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.240 align:middle line:84%
But we do know that there's
much greater risk of problems

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.080 align:middle line:84%
with another pregnancy
and another birth

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and that there's a danger
at this birth itself

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:26.250 align:middle line:84%
of hemorrhage, infection,
and uterine rupture

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.760 align:middle line:90%
with the uterus splitting open.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.760 align:middle line:84%
The progress that I
see taking place--

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:90%
it comes in leaps and bounds.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And then we go back, and
then we go forward again.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.900 align:middle line:84%
The great thing
is for those of us

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:50.210 align:middle line:84%
we want to change childbirth and
improve it that we keep at it,

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:84%
and don't give way and
think we've failed,

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.325 align:middle line:84%
and speak with a clear voice,
and join with other women

00:15:56.325 --> 00:15:57.125 align:middle line:90%
to speak.

00:15:57.125 --> 00:16:00.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
After a birth with a great
deal of intervention,

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:10.250 align:middle line:84%
a woman may at first feel
just happy to be beyond it.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.020 align:middle line:84%
The door's closed
on it, she thinks.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's over and done with.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And she doesn't mean to have
another baby very often.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.390 align:middle line:84%
And then some weeks after
or sometimes months,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
she suddenly feels
utterly cheated,

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and disempowered, and resentful,
and as if other women aren't

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:90%
like this.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:90%
It's just her and she's failed.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And this often goes along
with flashbacks to events

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:90%
during the birth--

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:51.470 align:middle line:84%
somebody holding up a needle
to inject her, for example,

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
or a row of faces at the other
end of the delivery table

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.690 align:middle line:90%
all staring at her vagina.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:90%


00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:90%
She thinks about this.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps on
coming back and not so

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
much as an intellectual
thought process, but much more

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:84%
the feeling when she
goes hot, and shaky,

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and shivery, and sweats,
and she has panic attacks.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:27.609 align:middle line:84%
And this is really
post-traumatic stress.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, when
she goes to her doctor,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:84%
it's often diagnosed
as depression.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And she is then treated
with anti-depressants.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's the worst
thing that could be done.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.310 align:middle line:84%
She needs somebody
to listen to her.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
She needs to work out how
she can get through this.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And when she has
anti-depressants,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.350 align:middle line:90%
she gets much worse.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And she wakes up in the
morning unable to face the day

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:02.050 align:middle line:84%
and may develop panic attacks
about leaving the house,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:06.350 align:middle line:84%
for example, or she can't
walk past the hospital.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, she feels utterly
isolated from other women.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And she goes back, for example,
to classes after the birth.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.460 align:middle line:84%
To report on the
birth is the idea.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.960 align:middle line:90%
And she feels she can't.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.310 align:middle line:90%
She can't.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:90%
So it's very harmful.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.730 align:middle line:90%
I cannot tell you how many.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.770 align:middle line:90%
This is not statistical.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:84%
It's often reckoned that
up to, I don't know,

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.150 align:middle line:84%
something like 7% of
women may experience this,

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:84%
but I would have
thought far more.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps I get
that idea because I

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.790 align:middle line:84%
get anything between three
and seven calls a week.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are repeat calls.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Because once I've talked with
a woman and listened to her,

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:90%
I always say to her, look.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:90%
Let's keep in touch about this.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.012 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to hear what happens.

00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps I've
suggested that she

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:84%
goes and talks to a midwife
or the obstetrician,

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.953 align:middle line:84%
finds out more, certainly
sees her case notes

00:19:05.953 --> 00:19:06.870 align:middle line:90%
and goes through them.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And I can go through her
case notes with her as well.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
But the great thing is to be
alongside her, not advising her

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
but with her as an
understanding friend,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.620 align:middle line:84%
and to gradually build
up her self-confidence

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:90%
so she can cope.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Of course, a woman
gets justifiably angry

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.175 align:middle line:84%
if she's had a Cesarean
section after a difficult birth

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and then is told she's not
going to be able to bond

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.650 align:middle line:90%
with her baby.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, with a little
bit of help, of course

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
she can bond with her baby
and her baby with her.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
It sounds almost as if you
haven't waved the magic wand.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.060 align:middle line:90%
And so this is what happens.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Here is you and the baby and
no connection between you.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously, that's
ridiculous if she gets support,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.110 align:middle line:84%
but women do need continuing
support both during pregnancy

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:03.190 align:middle line:90%
and I think afterwards.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, certainly right
through the what we

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.040 align:middle line:90%
used to call the third world.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.740 align:middle line:84%
Right through
traditional societies,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.010 align:middle line:84%
there are always other
women supporting a woman

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:18.160 align:middle line:84%
after childbirth, maybe with
her during childbirth too.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.580 align:middle line:84%
But they're there to give
help afterwards and allow her

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.550 align:middle line:84%
a chance to nurture
herself a bit

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and not feel she has to be
cooking her husband's meals

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:84%
or doing anything which
isn't in the nest.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And women do need a nest,
I think, after childbirth.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.172 align:middle line:90%
And it doesn't mean you're ill.

00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you
have to be on the bed

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.015 align:middle line:90%
if you don't fancy that.

00:20:42.015 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
You might be lying
in the garden.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:90%
You might be out swimming.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:90%
But you're your own person.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
think about everybody else

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is tricky once
you already have children.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:90%
I had five under six, was it?

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Or five under seven.

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't quite remember.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.070 align:middle line:90%
It's all a blur in my mind now.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, I had to give
attention to the other children

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was quite
an exciting time.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:90%
And I think I learned from it.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.640 align:middle line:84%
PTSD, post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.830 align:middle line:90%
can happen to any woman.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.770 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
she's weak or that she's

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:90%
failed in any way.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
She can be an
absolutely normal woman

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.760 align:middle line:84%
who's been subjected
to abnormal stress.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:90%
That's the essence of it.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And so it is for a
man who has PTSD,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:84%
men who have it after
battle, for example,

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.930 align:middle line:84%
because we first
learned about PTSD

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.510 align:middle line:90%
from treatment of soldiers.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:90%
So it isn't particularly female.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean that the
woman is unable to pull herself

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.950 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:52.360 align:middle line:84%
And she's often told if she is
miserable after birth, come on.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There are women having
babies all over the world.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.230 align:middle line:90%
Get on with it, woman.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And people get so
irritated with her.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And often, they are her
nearest and dearest.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And she's being treated
as an incompetent child.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's very-- it adds to
the distress, of course.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.120 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
A woman is more
likely to develop PTSD

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:84%
if she feels that all control
has been taken from her

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and she is the passive object of
other people's administrations.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.780 align:middle line:84%
She isn't asked for
consent, for example,

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
for different maneuvers
which they may do.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.010 align:middle line:84%
She's supposed to shut
up, and get on with it,

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and let them do the birth.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And she comes out of
that feeling helpless.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And this helplessness
can persist

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.950 align:middle line:90%
in other areas of her life too.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just the birth.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
But she gives up and feels
that it isn't justified

00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:00.330 align:middle line:84%
for her to take over
responsibility for anything.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And women can feel this
for many, many years.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.310 align:middle line:84%
I've had women in
their 60s and 70s

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.920 align:middle line:84%
ring me to talk about births
which they haven't yet

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:90%
worked through.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And this experience
has stayed with them

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and incapacitated them.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was astonished
when this first happened.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm very
relaxed about it.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.020 align:middle line:84%
And yes, of course,
it can go on.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.630 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't been able
to come to terms with it,

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.920 align:middle line:90%
it becomes innate.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.300 align:middle line:90%
And you think it's just you.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.490 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Women very often feel that
their feelings are unworthy,

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that somehow they have let the
side down suddenly as women.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And they get very
apologetic about it.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But PTSD, when this happens,
it is a normal response

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:90%
to abnormal stress.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Normally, I mean,
I often get women,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:84%
for example, who
are teachers who

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
teach perhaps large
classes, sometimes

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
of children with all
sorts of problems

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:18.020 align:middle line:84%
and or who experience violence
in one form or another.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And they will think, I
can be in control there.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.930 align:middle line:84%
But why did I behave in
this awful way during birth

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:31.540 align:middle line:84%
and giving up, handing
over, and also afterwards

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:84%
in continually going back to
the birth and how polluting

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and disempowering
it has made me feel?

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think this
is a major problem

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.490 align:middle line:84%
that a woman has a
perception of herself which

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:84%
is at odds with her normal
perception of herself

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.200 align:middle line:90%
and feeling able to cope.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.310 align:middle line:84%
I think some low-risk women
are choosing Cesarean section

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.430 align:middle line:84%
because they're scared
witless and because they

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
feel the power of the
medical establishment,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:90%
the power of obstetrics.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, midwives
feel like this too.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I have midwives ringing me
up who feel disempowered

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:84%
or in a birth have not been able
to do what they spontaneously

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.200 align:middle line:84%
wanted to do for a
woman like, for example,

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.660 align:middle line:84%
put their arms around
her or get her up

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and moving because it's
not allowed in the system.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:37.580 align:middle line:84%
There is a great fight going
on between obstetricians

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.100 align:middle line:84%
and other obstetricians
who are much more

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:84%
liberal and midwives
for whom midwifery

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is being with a woman, not
necessarily even speaking

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
to her, but being right there
with her giving her strength.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.830 align:middle line:90%
And I think this will change.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it's got so bad
in places like Australia

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.190 align:middle line:84%
and in places like New Jersey,
for example, where there's

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:13.220 align:middle line:84%
a very high percentage
of Cesarean sections

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.920 align:middle line:90%
60-something percent.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.430 align:middle line:84%
Where this happens, you've
really come to breaking point

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.480 align:middle line:90%
where the system has to change.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.950 align:middle line:90%
And it is a human rights issue.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:84%
In a system like
that of Australia

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.520 align:middle line:84%
where a women's right
to have a baby at home

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and to have a
midwife is really--

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.340 align:middle line:84%
it's being taken
away progressively

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:46.210 align:middle line:84%
and so that women feel
very guilty and angry when

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:50.660 align:middle line:84%
they can't do these things or
else just submit and think ah,

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.460 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.840 align:middle line:90%
They know what's what.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.410 align:middle line:90%
They're professionals.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.500 align:middle line:84%
I think it's very
important that we first

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
of all listen to the people who
are trying to impose the rules.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.530 align:middle line:84%
There's always a reason why
people try and impose rules.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And that includes politicians.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, it's
quite disturbing

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.930 align:middle line:84%
that because they've
been through what they've

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.250 align:middle line:84%
been through, they
think these rules have

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.650 align:middle line:90%
to be made for other women.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.990 align:middle line:84%
They get the wrong
end of the stick.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
And I always, when
I'm sitting, and I

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.490 align:middle line:84%
would be the same if I
was talking to your health

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.120 align:middle line:84%
minister, I want to know
what the experience is

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.480 align:middle line:90%
for that woman not necessarily--

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.520 align:middle line:84%
if it is a woman, yes,
perhaps once she gave birth,

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
but also other things,
yes, other things in which

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.840 align:middle line:84%
she's either felt able to
make choices with the right

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.120 align:middle line:84%
information or has
felt that she couldn't.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:84%
It was too far too dangerous
to make any choices

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.970 align:middle line:84%
because I think we
need to understand

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:52.930 align:middle line:90%
what makes them tick.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.800 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
A woman may decide to
face the challenge of pain

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in labor partly because
this pain is really rather

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.800 align:middle line:90%
different from other pain.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the pain of creation,
of mountains moving,

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.980 align:middle line:84%
the pain of energy welling
up from your pelvis

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.930 align:middle line:84%
filling yourself
and all around you.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can either see that
as something constructive

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.200 align:middle line:84%
or as something which
actually implies

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.840 align:middle line:90%
you're going to die any moment.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And there are some women who
will think the pain of labor

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:42.400 align:middle line:84%
indicates near death, destroys
them utterly, and others who

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.067 align:middle line:84%
will be able, because of the
environment in which they're

00:28:45.067 --> 00:28:46.900 align:middle line:84%
giving birth and the
support they're getting

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.260 align:middle line:84%
and the love that's flying over
them, to express themselves

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.260 align:middle line:90%
spontaneously.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.417 align:middle line:84%
And then pain becomes
something quite different.

00:28:53.417 --> 00:28:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.650 align:middle line:84%
The risk if a woman decides to
have everything blotted out,

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.310 align:middle line:84%
to be a passive patient and
to have things done to her

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:84%
which she doesn't even
have explained properly,

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:12.990 align:middle line:84%
I think the risk is that she
loses the spontaneous part

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.640 align:middle line:84%
of herself in which
she can let go, release

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:22.170 align:middle line:90%
completely, and feel exultant.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And she'll never
know or she may never

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:29.010 align:middle line:84%
know later what she
missed because she

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:31.250 align:middle line:90%
hasn't experienced this.
