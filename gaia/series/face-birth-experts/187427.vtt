00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm Sally Tracy, professor of
midwifery at Sydney University.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.240 align:middle line:84%
I was educated as a
midwife in New Zealand,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.000 align:middle line:84%
and then I studied
for my masters

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:84%
in London, where I
met some of the stars

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.870 align:middle line:90%
of the midwifery scene.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
back to New Zealand

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and then back home to Australia.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.880 align:middle line:84%
I was born in Australia and
brought up in the bush actually

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:84%
but having spent 25
years away and looking

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.405 align:middle line:84%
at the way midwifery is
offered in all of those years.

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
When I came back to Australia
after traveling and being away

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
for 25 years, I felt
I couldn't practice

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:90%
as a midwife in Australia.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.300 align:middle line:84%
I was so horrified
with the way birth

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
had remained if you
like under the influence

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
of the vested interests
that I actually

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
felt there was no place for
midwifery in the way I wanted

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:90%
to practice in Australia.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.207 align:middle line:84%
So I made a decision
to go into research.

00:01:09.207 --> 00:01:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I've been ever since.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:84%
You look at the maternity
scene in Australia.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:84%
And the lack of women's
voices, the lack of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:84%
control that women
have over their birth,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:90%
the control that people--

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:84%
that is vested in both medicine
and business absolutely

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.510 align:middle line:84%
convinced me that we had to find
a way of getting information

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
for women so that
they could politically

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
change this environment because
that's the only way I think

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
women will wrest back any
control over their birth

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Information from research is
only one part of the equation,

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's a very powerful part.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:90%
And it is something that is--

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
I think actually
it's worth doing.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.960 align:middle line:84%
It's worth doing in
the maternity system

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.500 align:middle line:84%
because, for example,
women are convinced

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.940 align:middle line:90%
that they go to hospital.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And they have an obstetrician.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're guided basically
by medical principles in birth.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
There has never been a
randomized control trial

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.320 align:middle line:90%
of obstetric care in birth.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.740 align:middle line:84%
There has never even been
an observational study

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that provides women with data
about their outcomes in birth

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.750 align:middle line:84%
if they are cared for by
a private obstetrician

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
or by any obstetrician
for that matter.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So my absolutely burning
aim was to seek funding,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.150 align:middle line:84%
which we have managed to do, and
to set up a randomized control

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
trial of offering women
midwifery care in birth.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.280 align:middle line:84%
There's probably never been a
study done on obstetric care

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.640 align:middle line:84%
because actually that
lobby if you like

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:90%
don't have to be accountable.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.050 align:middle line:84%
They're already
supported by industry.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.520 align:middle line:84%
They're supported by the
authority that medicine holds.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And they don't actually
have to be accountable.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Women don't go and ask,
what are your outcomes

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.600 align:middle line:84%
or should I go to
an obstetrician?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
They're told that it's safe
to go to an obstetrician.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.730 align:middle line:84%
They're told that
that's the best

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.710 align:middle line:90%
way that they can give birth.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually convinced
that anything else isn't

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.350 align:middle line:90%
safe for them and their baby.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, these people
have been handed this mantle

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
to provide care in maternity
without any evidence sitting

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.360 align:middle line:90%
under it.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
Australia is the last bastion
of the Western world where

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:90%
medicine holds such power.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I think even the US is more
accountable to the population

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.780 align:middle line:90%
than medicine is in Australia.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.735 align:middle line:84%
And we've just had
maternity reforms.

00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:18.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.670 align:middle line:90%
Women are the losers.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Women completely lost out in the
Commonwealth maternity reforms.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.390 align:middle line:84%
A home birth was this far
from being criminalized.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
We're no closer to women having
the choice of having a midwife

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.200 align:middle line:84%
and giving birth in a place they
want to give birth than we were

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.420 align:middle line:90%
before the maternity reforms.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And this is because
we are absolutely

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.380 align:middle line:84%
beholden to industry and the
vested interests of medicine.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.270 align:middle line:90%
They have the loudest voice.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:90%
They have the most power.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And we are fighting
an uphill battle

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.060 align:middle line:84%
to try and even argue that
birth is a physiological event

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.660 align:middle line:84%
that women actually
have some say in where

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.500 align:middle line:90%
they want to do it.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And Australia sits in stark
contrast to New Zealand.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
the reforms around birth

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
in New Zealand-- and we were
all in much the same position

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:90%
20 years ago.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 0.3% of women gave
birth at home at that time.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And we're still there.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:84%
But in New Zealand, they
had a visionary woman

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
who was the health
minister who later

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:90%
became the prime minister.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Her whole cabinet, every
woman in that parliament,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
crossed the floor
to vote that women

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:84%
should have the choice of where
to give birth and with whom.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And it was as simple as that.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.550 align:middle line:84%
If you come back to
Australia, our reforms--

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
the government took
advice from the AMA.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.470 align:middle line:84%
They took advice from
all the colleges.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.710 align:middle line:84%
I sat at the table where we
were supposed to be working up

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.990 align:middle line:90%
how these reforms should work.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.510 align:middle line:84%
2/3 of the people
around that table

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.360 align:middle line:84%
represented the
interests of medicine.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:90%
We had two consumers.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:90%
And we had about three midwives.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.050 align:middle line:90%
So we lost it.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:84%
It's almost a novelty to say to
people that women can actually

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
make decisions and
weigh up the evidence

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.470 align:middle line:90%
and decide for themselves.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.140 align:middle line:84%
The media constantly
convinces women

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
that they're unsafe in birth
and that they need hospitals.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They need doctors and they
need midwives in hospital.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to
present information

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.690 align:middle line:84%
that is accessible for women
to make up their own mind.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%
If I achieve nothing
else in this life,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.870 align:middle line:84%
I want to be able to present
information that is accessible.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.600 align:middle line:84%
I may have to publish in
the "Women's Weekly" and not

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:90%
the "British Medical Journal."

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it takes.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:15.630 align:middle line:84%
But women given the
information will actually

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:84%
be able to make these
decisions for themselves.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment, most
of that information

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.130 align:middle line:84%
is hidden from them partly
because the research has never

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:90%
been done.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.280 align:middle line:84%
I have two main areas
where my research

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.230 align:middle line:90%
is focused at the moment.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.310 align:middle line:84%
One is set in the
public hospital

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:84%
where every woman has access
to health care in Australia.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are the lucky
country in this sense.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to
do is make sure

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that every woman who comes
into a public hospital

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:84%
is able to find a midwife
who she can get to know.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:84%
She can form some sort
of relationship with.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And when she comes
in to give birth,

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:90%
she's not going to be afraid.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:84%
She's not going to
be among strangers.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And she's going to be able
to give birth in privacy

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
with someone who she
can really trust.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And post-natally, I'd hope
that those women can go home

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
from hospital as soon as
possible and the midwife

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:90%
visit them at home.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:84%
So the research I'm doing at
the moment is looking at--

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.220 align:middle line:84%
is researching how
well that system works,

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:84%
how safe is it for women,
whether in fact they

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:84%
have less Cesarean
sections, whether they're

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.039 align:middle line:84%
able to breastfeed at the end
of the birthing experience,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.919 align:middle line:84%
and actually how they feel
about their own health

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.179 align:middle line:90%
once they've given birth.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.520 align:middle line:84%
The other main area of
research I have at the moment

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.950 align:middle line:84%
is evaluating the little
primary cottage birth units,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.470 align:middle line:90%
the standalone birth units.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a quantum
shift for women to,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.110 align:middle line:84%
within our society where
they're told to be so afraid,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.030 align:middle line:84%
it's a quantum shift
for them to think, well,

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.800 align:middle line:90%
I can just give birth at home.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
But what they can
do is give birth

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
in a little cottage
hospital where

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:84%
it's a halfway house, if you
like, between the main hospital

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:84%
where everything
pings and whistles

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and home where we
don't have much,

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
but the cottage hospital where
the midwife and things look

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
like sort of there

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
could be some help
around the corner.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So my research is evaluating
the primary units.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And in Australia at the
moment, we've only got two.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:90%
New Zealand have 56.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But I guess that's a comment
on the state of things

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Maternity care
all over the world

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:57.320 align:middle line:84%
has really suffered from
the control of medicine

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:84%
and vested interests
to some extent.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
I think there's one
place in the world where

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
there's hope actually
for women giving birth.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:90%
And it's just across the Tasman.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:84%
New Zealand has the
most astonishing system

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:90%
for maternity.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Most of the world
doesn't know it.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And they themselves
don't often know it.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I've taught students who
have only known this system.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well, what's
so special about it?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.810 align:middle line:90%
It is very special.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And it's very, very
special because the control

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.550 align:middle line:84%
has been put in the hands
of the woman who is pregnant

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.530 align:middle line:90%
and her family.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And by doing that,
the government

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:90%
has vested women with the--

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
finally with the ability
to choose a midwife

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
if they want to,
choose a doctor if they

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.240 align:middle line:90%
want to, to give birth at home.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.950 align:middle line:84%
They might be progressing
in their labor.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that
perhaps things aren't

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.580 align:middle line:90%
going as well as they should.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.680 align:middle line:90%
Let's go to hospital.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.580 align:middle line:90%
There's no problem with that.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
So the women actually
have the control

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:84%
alongside their midwife
to give birth in the way

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:90%
that they want to.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I was horrified
when I arrived back

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:90%
in Australia to hear that--

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:84%
and it was before
a senate inquiry

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:84%
that in fact, we had these
really high levels of Cesarean

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.720 align:middle line:84%
section and instrumental birth
because women were older.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.040 align:middle line:90%
And they were sicker.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.820 align:middle line:84%
And they absolutely needed to
have private obstetric care.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- it
didn't make sense.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:90%
It didn't make sense.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.270 align:middle line:84%
So we actually did
the research on that.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at women
who were considered

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:84%
to be without risk factors who
didn't appear to have anything

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.370 align:middle line:84%
that would be untoward
in their pregnancy

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:90%
or to do with their health.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.590 align:middle line:84%
And we looked at what happened
to them when they gave birth

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:90%
in the public hospital.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And we actually looked
at three levels of care.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
So we looked at those women who
came into the public hospital

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.820 align:middle line:84%
and gave birth, those women who
came in to the public hospital

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
and had a private
obstetrician, and then

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
women who went to
a private hospital

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:90%
and had a private obstetrician.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:90%
And the results were horrifying.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was that women who

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.150 align:middle line:84%
had paid through the nose
for this expensive care

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:84%
with a private obstetrician
in a private hospital

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.160 align:middle line:84%
were having more than double
the rates of intervention.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.210 align:middle line:84%
What was silent in
that research was

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
what I've discovered
since then, which

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.700 align:middle line:84%
was the admission of
babies to neonatal unit.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And these are the silent
costs in our system

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.090 align:middle line:84%
that no one is asking
questions about.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.580 align:middle line:84%
But what we know
is that babies who

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
are born to women again who
have no risks in pregnancy

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:12.540 align:middle line:84%
and birth because
of the intervention,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:84%
because of the induction,
because of the augmentation,

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:19.530 align:middle line:84%
because of all of the fiddling
around with their labor

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
and their being in hospitals
where they can't labor well,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.220 align:middle line:84%
these women are having Cesarean
sections or instrumental

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.090 align:middle line:90%
births.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And their babies
are flat at birth.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to
the neonatal unit.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sounds quite
benign in itself,

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
but we're separating
mothers from their babies.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Women who give birth who had no
idea that their baby wouldn't

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.290 align:middle line:84%
be safe at the end of
it, they've gone in,

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.145 align:middle line:84%
had an elective
Cesarean section,

00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly, their
baby's whisked away

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.980 align:middle line:84%
to the neonatal unit because
it's having trouble breathing.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, no one told them that
that was a possibility.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:84%
So these are the things
that our research

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.580 align:middle line:84%
has to find out for
women so that women

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:90%
have got this information.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
They know they're three
times more likely to go

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
to a neonatal unit if
they have their baby

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:90%
by elective Cesarean section.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It's as simple as
that in Australia.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So that's something to
weigh up, especially

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.910 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be with your baby
and have skin to skin contact.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And you want to breastfeed it.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And actually, you only had
an elective Cesarean section

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
because, well, it suited
your lifestyle at that time.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You would reconsider
those things

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:90%
if you had the information.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we hope to do--
give women this information.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.820 align:middle line:84%
The important thing is
not to act or vilify

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:90%
the Cesarean section as such.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.530 align:middle line:84%
The important
thing is that women

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.590 align:middle line:90%
know this is a possibility.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.580 align:middle line:84%
If their birth is not
happening as it should be,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.710 align:middle line:84%
there is the possibility
of a Cesarean section,

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:56.610 align:middle line:84%
which is in Australia
a very safe operation.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Where we're going wrong is by
normalizing Cesarean section

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.420 align:middle line:84%
for women to think that
having a Cesarean section

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
is a perfectly normal
way to give birth.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And there is more
and more evidence

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.110 align:middle line:84%
now to say that this is
actually not the case.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got superb studies
coming from Oxford

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
showing that the bugs in
the mother's gut somehow

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
quite mysteriously switch on
the immune response of the baby.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:31.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
rates of diabetes

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
are being affected by the
way babies are being born.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:84%
So what we do have to have
is information for women

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to know that, yes, a cesarean
is a very real possibility.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a very real
probability in some births.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a normal
way to give birth.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And given that
information, women

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.530 align:middle line:84%
will make a decision about what
they want to do in this case.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:06.380 align:middle line:84%
What we don't have in
Australia is really robust data

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:90%
about the safety of home birth.

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it's very easy
to demonize something

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:90%
because we don't have the data.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, we don't
demonize obstetric care,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.250 align:middle line:84%
even though we don't have
the randomized control

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:90%
trial on obstetric care.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
demonize home birth.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Because after all, women
are choosing home birth.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And there is that
perception that women

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.515 align:middle line:84%
aren't choosing what's best
for themselves and their baby.

00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:36.710 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is going
to take many years for us

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.840 align:middle line:90%
to change.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually being
able to believe in women,

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.860 align:middle line:84%
that women actually
know what to do,

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:90%
and trusting them to do that.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
In a country like Australia that
is so obsessed by the market,

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.870 align:middle line:90%
by making money, by the whole--

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.180 align:middle line:84%
we're a very proud
industrial country

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.160 align:middle line:90%
and hugely resource rich--

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.710 align:middle line:84%
it's so interesting that the
bottom line in maternity care

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:90%
is never considered.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
What research shows-- and this
was research that was done over

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:90%
a decade ago--

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
was that the more
interventions you

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:28.040 align:middle line:84%
bring into the birth process,
the higher the cost will be.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a cost that is related
to the way women give birth,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:84%
how long they might stay
in hospital, what sort

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:90%
of interventions are required.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you add inductions,
you add epidurals,

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.620 align:middle line:84%
you end up with a much higher
rate of instrumental birth

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.860 align:middle line:90%
or Cesarean section.

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.185 align:middle line:84%
So these are the things that
actually add to the cost.

00:17:49.185 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The argument leveled
at the rising

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.060 align:middle line:84%
rates or the
cascade of invention

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:90%
is that women need these things.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.230 align:middle line:90%
And it's a very--

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.840 align:middle line:84%
it is quite a subtle
thing actually.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:84%
If you have women who
come into a hospital who

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.740 align:middle line:84%
don't know anybody,
certainly don't

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.770 align:middle line:84%
know who's going to
be looking after them,

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:18.180 align:middle line:84%
the smells are very different
to home and outside.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:90%
There's a natural fear.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.870 align:middle line:84%
There's a natural
anxiety that builds up.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And so what we find
is that if women

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
coming into these
huge factories really

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.810 align:middle line:84%
suffer all sorts of things
that actually affect the birth

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.170 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can say this
now because we're

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:84%
doing a randomized
control trial, which

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.012 align:middle line:84%
is looking at what happens
when women don't come straight

00:18:49.012 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
into hospital when they
think they're in labor?

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.100 align:middle line:90%
They ring their midwife.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
The midwife might even
visit them and see

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:90%
whether they're in labor.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And if they are in
labor, they come in.

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.715 align:middle line:84%
For the women who don't have
that who come into hospital,

00:19:03.715 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:84%
the minute they think
they're in labor,

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
they'll ring and be
told, well, come on in,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.110 align:middle line:84%
those women often sit
in the labor ward.

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Their labor doesn't progress
for whatever reason.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And so following a certain time
interval, the clock's ticking.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And on comes the intervention.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:90%
So they'll have an induction.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:90%
They'll have a augmentation.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.070 align:middle line:90%
The labor will be hurried up.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course, that
causes quite a lot of pain

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that's different to your normal
sort of rhythmic labor pain.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And so epidural's called.

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And then once the
epidural's in, the labor

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.990 align:middle line:90%
may still not progress.

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And many more women end
up having an instrumental

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.290 align:middle line:90%
birth or a Cesarean section.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
What we've been
able to show then

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.740 align:middle line:84%
is not so much that women need
this level of intervention,

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
but that it's occurring
because of the way

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:84%
we're actually managing the
way birth is undertaken,

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.060 align:middle line:90%
the way women are giving birth.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And so if we can change
that, what we're trying to do

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.920 align:middle line:84%
is to actually match the sort
of care we're offering women

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.280 align:middle line:84%
to the rhythm, the
natural rhythm of birth

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:90%
and women's rhythms.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:84%
So if the woman
comes into labor,

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
she can probably stay at
home for several hours

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and labor at home in her own
bed or in her own kitchen,

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.440 align:middle line:90%
wherever, with her children.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And then when she
does need to come in,

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.030 align:middle line:84%
she can come in then for
a short period of time,

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:84%
give birth, and go
home with her midwife.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And changing that
is actually changing

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.615 align:middle line:84%
hugely the rates of intervention
and Cesarean section.

00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The only reason Australia has
such high intervention rates

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and high Cesarean
section rates really

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
is because people are convinced
that this probably saved

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.510 align:middle line:90%
their baby or saved their life.

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.900 align:middle line:84%
The argument is that if you
hadn't been in hospital, if you

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.900 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been able to have
this level of intervention,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
or this medication,
the Cesarean section,

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
either you or your
baby might have died.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.840 align:middle line:84%
What we need here is research
for women to understand

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and families to understand that
this is probably not the case,

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:90%
but we can't--

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit here and
say that's not the case.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.460 align:middle line:84%
But our research is showing
that that is not the case.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And our research is
actually showing really

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.840 align:middle line:84%
what the WHO have
been saying all along.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the Cesar rate
should not be sitting probably

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:55.930 align:middle line:84%
above 15% and that mortality
and morbidity is not necessarily

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
improved by these rising
rates of Cesarean section.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think our research will
actually show that very, very

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:11.380 align:middle line:84%
categorically that without
intervention, with being

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:19.090 align:middle line:84%
able to give birth without
fear, is probably actually going

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.440 align:middle line:84%
to lower the Cesarean section
rate more than anything else.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:84%
Coming to birth in
a hospital is not

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
just about the loss of
control, but think of the cost.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Think of the cost of giving
birth at home compared

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to giving birth in this
huge institution that

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
runs on thousands
of dollars an hour.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make sense.

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.840 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't make
sense that we don't

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:84%
look at ways of
promoting, on the one

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.430 align:middle line:84%
hand, this wonderful way of
giving birth that doesn't cost

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
an arm and a leg compared to
this huge industry of hospital

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:90%
and technological medicine.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I think the one
reason in Australia

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:18.660 align:middle line:84%
why we don't do this, why
we don't explore this,

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.310 align:middle line:84%
is because there is so
much tied up in industry.

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.960 align:middle line:90%
It comes back to the market.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:90%
It's the vested interests.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
People really profit out of
keeping births in hospital.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:37.980 align:middle line:84%
They don't profit when women
take that control and that cost

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.740 align:middle line:84%
themselves and
give birth at home.

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But in Australia, we
don't ask those questions

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.600 align:middle line:84%
because actually we
haven't really had to.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.160 align:middle line:90%
There's plenty of money.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.540 align:middle line:90%
It keeps rolling.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.040 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't come
through Medicare,

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
it comes through private
health insurance.

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:90%
It gets subsidized.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Doctors make
millions and millions

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.920 align:middle line:84%
out of looking after
women who have no need

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:84%
at all to be looked after
by doctors in birth.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.070 align:middle line:90%
But it's a business.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.680 align:middle line:90%
And it brings in a lot of money.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And really to take
that on, you have

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to be fairly stupid
or very clever.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the AMA is the
strongest, most powerful union

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.650 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's this power of
medicine, of industry,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.370 align:middle line:84%
of the market that actually
drives this country.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Having said that the
government-- that the way

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.780 align:middle line:84%
birth is actually-- or
the maternity system

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.040 align:middle line:84%
in this country is run by
these powerful lobbies,

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I think it's also important
to say that as midwives, we

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.020 align:middle line:84%
could fall into
exactly the same trap.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we
could have it leveled

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.010 align:middle line:84%
that midwifery is trying to
build up the power for itself.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I think the very
important issue here is,

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:11.350 align:middle line:84%
and one that I feel absolutely
as if my whole life works on,

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:17.320 align:middle line:84%
is that women themselves are
our best teachers around birth.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.840 align:middle line:84%
If we listen to the
woman, we'll know what

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:90%
to do as a caregiver in birth.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.700 align:middle line:84%
This happens in home,
in hospital, anywhere.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is that if
we provide the information,

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:33.760 align:middle line:84%
the women can make that choice
about who they want to go to.

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's where we
haven't come in Australia.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:90%
So we do have vested interests.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:84%
We do have the possibility of
midwifery actually becoming

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:middle line:90%
just another vested interest.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.420 align:middle line:84%
The saving grace is
if we keep our focus

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
on what it is that women want
when they're giving birth

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.920 align:middle line:90%
and give--

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.360 align:middle line:84%
allow those women to have the
control of that experience

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.500 align:middle line:84%
themselves with their family,
with their partner, then

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.880 align:middle line:84%
that's what will shape
our maternity care.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.680 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
need to be shaped.
