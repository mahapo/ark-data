00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:13.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I was introduced in the field
of obstetrics as early as 1953.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.690 align:middle line:84%
In 1953, I spent six months
in a maternity unit of a Paris

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250 align:middle line:90%
hospital as a medical student.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
What, at that time, we
used to call an extan.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.780 align:middle line:84%
It means a medical student
with minor clinical

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.300 align:middle line:90%
responsibilities.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So it mean that I have
a sort of overview

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.300 align:middle line:84%
of the history of
childbirth since the middle

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And until now, since I'm
still occasionally involved

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.460 align:middle line:90%
in home birth in London.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's shown that the Cesarean
section became safer and safer

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.860 align:middle line:90%
all along the 20th century.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And we must say that
the technique are still

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.555 align:middle line:84%
being improved since the
beginning of the 21st century.

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:84%
We can say, to summarize
at the present time,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
that Cesarean section has become
a very easy and fast operation.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's possible to do a
Cesarean section in 20 minutes.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
When I did my first Cesarean
section in the 1950s,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.360 align:middle line:90%
we needed an hour being fast.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And we could not
start the operation

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.670 align:middle line:84%
without having, at our disposal,
one or two bottles of blood

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:90%
to compensate the blood loss.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Today, the average blood loss
during a Cesarean section

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
is comparatively often the same
as the average birth blood loss

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
during a birth by
the vaginal route.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of
safety, of course,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:84%
it's not easy to ever read the
safety of the Cesarean section,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:84%
the main criteria being
the risk of maternal death.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.920 align:middle line:84%
That's the main
risk, the first one

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that was taken into
account until the middle

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.900 align:middle line:90%
of the 20th century.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.170 align:middle line:84%
It's commonplace in the
natural childbirth movement

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to say, oh, if you have
a Cesarean section,

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
the risk of the mother
to die is multiplied

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.150 align:middle line:90%
by two or three, which is true.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.120 align:middle line:84%
But that does not
take into account

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.950 align:middle line:84%
the reason why the Cesarean
section had been done.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, when there
is maternal death,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
more often than not, the reason
is not the Cesarean itself.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:84%
It's why this woman
needed a Cesarean section.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the population
of women who had a C-section,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
you have a greater
number than either

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.350 align:middle line:84%
of the groups of women with
pathological conditions.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
But today, there is a way to
overcome these difficulties.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.220 align:middle line:84%
We have huge statistics
of Cesarean section

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:90%
done for the same reason.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, a Canadian
statistic of 46,000 Cesarean

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:84%
section at 39 weeks of
pregnancy for the same reason--

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:90%
breech presentation.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And in these 46,000 cases of
C-section, zero maternal death.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.080 align:middle line:84%
So what we can say
to summarize today,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.990 align:middle line:84%
when we only take into account
the conventional criteria

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.570 align:middle line:84%
to evaluate the
practices of obstetrics--

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
number of babies
alive at birth, number

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:84%
of babies healthy at birth,
health problems the mother

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:90%
might experience after a birth.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Today we can say that
a Cesarean section

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is a very safe operation,
according to this criteria.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.530 align:middle line:84%
So we can say today, C-section
is easy, fast, and safe.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.500 align:middle line:84%
For people of my generation, the
safety of the Cesarean section

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:90%
is almost incredible.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It's shown that today, technical
advances, particularly advances

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:84%
regarding the
technique of Cesarean

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
section are pushing the
history of childbirth

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.430 align:middle line:90%
in a certain direction this way.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.000 align:middle line:84%
Why not offering a Cesarean
section to all pregnant women?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time that
there are technical advances,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:84%
there are scientific advances,
and the scientific advances

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.980 align:middle line:84%
push the history of childbirth
in the other direction.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And in spite of the safety
of the Cesarean section,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.690 align:middle line:84%
they give, they offer
some good reasons today

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:33.400 align:middle line:84%
to try to disturb as little
as possible the physiological

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.470 align:middle line:90%
processes.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
They give good reason to try
to improve our understanding

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:90%
of the birth process.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.400 align:middle line:84%
They give good reason to try
to rediscover, after thousands

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.680 align:middle line:84%
of years of cultural
conditioning,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to rediscover the basic
need of women in labor.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is the case of
several scientific disciplines,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
particularly the
discipline that participate

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
in what I have called the
scientification of love.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, in the past,
love was a topic for poets,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:90%
for philosophers, for novelists.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's studied
from multiple scientific

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.290 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And all this perspective,
whatever this perspective,

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:84%
looking at behavior
on effect of hormones,

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
like oxytocin, studying
the long-term effect

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:84%
of our well-born, whatever
the perspective, today,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.350 align:middle line:84%
we can conclude
that the capacity

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.660 align:middle line:84%
to love develop to a
great extent in the period

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
surrounding birth,
where learning how

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.120 align:middle line:90%
the capacity to love develop.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, where love, in
particular, and that's

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
very important in the
history of sciences

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.950 align:middle line:84%
that the hormone necessary to
contact the uterus, to contact

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.990 align:middle line:84%
the uterus for the
birth of the baby

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
and for the delivery
of the placenta,

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:84%
this hormone, called
oxytocin, is also

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:90%
the main hormone of love.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So from what we
are learning today

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:84%
from many scientific
perspective,

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.110 align:middle line:84%
we conclude that we need
new criteria to evaluate

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:90%
how babies are born.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.500 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn
to think long term.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn, also, to
think in terms of civilization.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we say thinking
long term, of course,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:84%
it's thinking of the
well-documented, life-long

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.450 align:middle line:84%
effect of what's
happening at birth,

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:90%
but it's even more than that.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Today, at the time when some
concept like gene expression

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.860 align:middle line:84%
or epigenetics are
becoming more familiar,

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.340 align:middle line:84%
we are learning that
some acquired traits,

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.020 align:middle line:84%
some acquired characteristics
can be transmitted

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:90%
to the following generation.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have to
learn even to think

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:84%
to the transgenerational
consequences of what

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.110 align:middle line:84%
we are doing and particularly,
how babies are born.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:84%
We have some reasons in the
current scientific context,

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.790 align:middle line:90%
in particular, to wonder.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:29.720 align:middle line:84%
But is it possible that
the capacity to give birth

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:84%
might be reduced, weakened
from generation to generation,

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
since at the present time, must
women finally don't give birth?

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Must women-- that's absolutely
new in the history of mankind--

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.340 align:middle line:84%
most women don't
rely on the release

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of their natural hormones
to give birth to the baby

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and to deliver the
placenta until recently.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:06.830 align:middle line:84%
In spite of thousand of years
of cultural interference,

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:90%
beliefs, reasons, and so on.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.870 align:middle line:84%
However, until recently,
in order to have a baby,

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
a woman was obliged to rely on
the release of hormonal flow.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.880 align:middle line:84%
The main component
of this hormonal flow

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.330 align:middle line:84%
being oxytocin but other
hormone, like endorphins,

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:84%
prolactin, vasopressin,
and so on and so on.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Impossible to have a
baby without relying

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.790 align:middle line:84%
on these natural
hormones until recently.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And what we are learning
from model scientists

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.470 align:middle line:84%
is that this hormonal flow,
necessary to have a baby

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
and to give up the
placenta, is a sort

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.990 align:middle line:90%
of cocktail of love hormones.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.860 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But today, for the first time
in the history of mankind,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:84%
the number of women at
the level of the planet

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.030 align:middle line:84%
will give birth to the
baby and to the placenta

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the release of this
cocktail of love hormones,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.890 align:middle line:84%
this number is approaching
zero for obvious reason.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:24.410 align:middle line:84%
First, we have to mention
the most common intervention

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
in childbirth, which
is the use of a drip

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.290 align:middle line:90%
of synthetic oxytocin.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Today, most women
have such a drip.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
That to say, synthetic oxytocin
replacing the natural oxytocin.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Most women who give
birth vaginally today,

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
with or without forcep,
with or without vacuum,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.650 align:middle line:84%
vacuum-assisted,
finally, have a drip

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
in their arm, intravenous
drip of synthetic oxytocin.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.050 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Because they cannot release
their natural oxytocin.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
The release of
oxytocin is highly

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:84%
dependent on
environmental factors.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So these women need to
replace their natural hormone.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.710 align:middle line:84%
Most women who will give birth
by Cesarean section today

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.450 align:middle line:84%
have a drip of
synthetic oxytocin

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:84%
before the operation
was decided.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And as everybody knows,
the rate of labor induction

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:84%
at the present time in
many hospitals is very high

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and that also includes a use
of drip of synthetic oxytocin.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:84%
So most women today have a
drip of synthetic oxytocin

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
if they give birth vaginally
or if they give birth

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.320 align:middle line:84%
by C-section, which
is also a vehicle.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So when a woman has a drip
of synthetic oxytocin often

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
associated with other drugs
like epidural anesthesia

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and so on and so on, it's mean
that this synthetic oxytocin

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.820 align:middle line:84%
block the release of
the natural hormones

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:19.250 align:middle line:84%
without having the
same behavioral effect.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Natural oxytocin
is a love hormone.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:84%
The drip of synthetic
oxytocin has

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.690 align:middle line:84%
no effect on behavior
for well-know reasons.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.330 align:middle line:84%
These are not rich,
sensitive cells in the brain,

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.400 align:middle line:90%
for one reason.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So just to say that we are in
an absolutely new situation.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:84%
For the first time in
the history of mankind,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the number of women who
give birth to the baby

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:84%
and to the placenta,
thanks to the release

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of a cocktail of love
hormones, this number

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:90%
is approaching zero.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.210 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
might say that we

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
have made love hormones
useless in the critical period

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.650 align:middle line:90%
surrounding birth.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a fact.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
But just explaining
this fact isn't

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:90%
to explain this fact today.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.460 align:middle line:84%
It would have been difficult
to say that 20 years ago.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.810 align:middle line:90%
Today, we consider.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Just explaining this fact
and immediately, everybody

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.300 align:middle line:84%
can understand the need for
new appropriate questions.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.550 align:middle line:84%
When we are in a new
situation, the priority

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.670 align:middle line:90%
is to phrase new questions.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
what's happening today,

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.800 align:middle line:84%
we realize that
we have to wonder

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:84%
about what would happen after
three, four, five generations?

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:50.610 align:middle line:84%
If we're going in
the same direction,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.690 align:middle line:84%
what will happen in
terms of civilization?

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to think
in terms of civilization.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we can say
that in spite of the safety

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and the simplicity of
the Cesarean section,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:84%
there are many reasons to try
to rediscover the basic need

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:90%
of women in labor.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Making love hormones useless--

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:90%
it's serious.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a turning
point in the history

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
of childbirth, which
is a turning point

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%
in the history of mankind.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
What we are talking about when
we talk about childbirth today,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.060 align:middle line:84%
it's not a topic for
some groups of people.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not a topic for doctors.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not a topic for midwives.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not a topic
for pregnant women.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.140 align:middle line:84%
It's a topic for
all those interested

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.980 align:middle line:90%
in the future of humanity.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So is there a measurable
effect of having a baby

00:14:53.950 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
without releasing the
natural flow of hormones,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.160 align:middle line:84%
a woman, like all
mammals, is supposed

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:90%
to release when giving birth?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
So to answer this question, we
cannot use any animal model.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Among non-human
mammals, the effect

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
are too simple,
too easily detected

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.550 align:middle line:90%
at an individual level.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
If non-human mammals
give birth, for example,

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.230 align:middle line:84%
with an epidural
anesthesia, it's simple.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
The mother is not
interested in her baby.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Full stop.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.500 align:middle line:84%
The same if the mother give
birth by Cesarean section.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
The baby will survive
only if human being

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.170 align:middle line:90%
take care of the baby.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.910 align:middle line:84%
So among non-human
mammals, it's too simple.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
You disturb the hormonal balance
of the mother giving birth,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.370 align:middle line:84%
the mother is not
interested in her baby.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:04.090 align:middle line:84%
A human is much more complex
than that, and we know why.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.310 align:middle line:84%
There have been
millions of women

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.280 align:middle line:84%
who took care of their
baby after giving birth

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.340 align:middle line:84%
by epidural anesthesia
or Cesarean section.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And we know why it's more
complex, because we speak.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:90%
We create cultural milieus.

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.830 align:middle line:90%
We live in a culture.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So that in some situations,
like the period of birth,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.410 align:middle line:84%
the human behavior
is less directly

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.630 align:middle line:84%
under the effect of the hormonal
balance and more directly

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:84%
under the effect of
the cultural milieu.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.760 align:middle line:84%
For example, when a
woman is pregnant,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.980 align:middle line:84%
because she's a human being,
she knows that she's pregnant.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.240 align:middle line:84%
She knows that she
will have a baby.

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.980 align:middle line:84%
She can anticipate
maternal behavior,

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.620 align:middle line:90%
what other mammals cannot do.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Other mammals have
to wait until the day

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.770 align:middle line:84%
when they release a
cocktail of love hormones

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to give birth to be
interested in their baby.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.810 align:middle line:84%
It does not mean
that we have nothing

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:90%
to learn from other mammals.

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:90%
In that, we learn a lot.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:19.569 align:middle line:84%
But we learn which
question we should phrase,

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:23.619 align:middle line:84%
we should raise today where
human beings are concerned.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.079 align:middle line:84%
And where human
beings are concerned,

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.450 align:middle line:84%
we have always to
introduce the word

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.315 align:middle line:90%
"civilization" in the question.

00:17:31.315 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:90%
For example, if ewes--

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.150 align:middle line:84%
experiment have been
done with ewes--

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.600 align:middle line:84%
don't take care of their
baby after giving birth

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.900 align:middle line:84%
with an epidural anesthesia,
the question might be,

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:84%
what is a future
of a civilization

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.880 align:middle line:84%
born with an
epidural anesthesia?

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
We can raise the same question
with Cesarean sections,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.320 align:middle line:84%
if you use the called
collective dimension.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And there is one way
to understand the need

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.952 align:middle line:90%
for the collective dimension.

00:18:07.952 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
To understand that conventional
criteria that are short term

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and at only at individual
level are not sufficient today.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:22.600 align:middle line:84%
One way to understand that
is to look at our database.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:28.730 align:middle line:84%
In our center in London,
one of our goals,

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:35.200 align:middle line:84%
one of our activities has been
to establish a database called

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.190 align:middle line:84%
the Primal Health Research
database that everybody

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.430 align:middle line:90%
can explore on the web.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:84%
Our database is specialized
in studies exploring

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.470 align:middle line:84%
the long-term consequences
of what happens

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.630 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of our life.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And the beginning of our
life includes not only

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.130 align:middle line:84%
life in the womb, not only
the year following birth,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.060 align:middle line:90%
but also the birth itself.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at
our database, which

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.540 align:middle line:84%
includes only studies
published in authoritative

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:84%
medical or scientific
journal, you'll

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
notice that to detect
significant effect of what's

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:34.120 align:middle line:84%
happening at birth, researchers,
the so-called epidemiologists,

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:39.500 align:middle line:84%
researchers need huge
numbers to detect tendencies.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.110 align:middle line:84%
That's because we
are human beings.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.070 align:middle line:84%
They explain that we need
the collective dimension.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I can give an example
just to be concrete.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:20:00.330 align:middle line:84%
A Swedish study about the
risk of being autistic--

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:84%
topical, topical--
the researchers

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:09.260 align:middle line:84%
had at their disposal
the birth records

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:84%
of all the Swedish people
born during a period

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
of 20 years, all the birth
records, 1974 to 1993.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.470 align:middle line:84%
They also had at their
disposal, the medical files

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:31.450 align:middle line:84%
of all the Swedish people who
had been diagnosed as autistic,

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:84%
for each of them five controls,
over the time, the computers.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.530 align:middle line:84%
With this method,
they could detect

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.590 align:middle line:84%
risk factors, tendencies,
differences that

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:90%
were statically significant.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:53.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't say anything
about particular cases.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to
understand that when

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.250 align:middle line:84%
we talk about human
beings, we have

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:00.710 align:middle line:84%
to reach the collective
dimension, which

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.200 align:middle line:84%
is roughly the same as
to say we have to think

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.230 align:middle line:90%
in terms of civilization.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So that why, when
people ask if there

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
is a lack of interaction between
mother and newborn baby, what

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.140 align:middle line:90%
can be the effect?

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
We can say at individual level,
difficult to detect something,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:25.130 align:middle line:84%
because we are human beings,
because the cultural media can

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.440 align:middle line:90%
compensate minute deficit.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But the question are, what
will happen, for example,

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
if all babies are born
by Cesarean section

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.770 align:middle line:84%
without the use
of love hormones?

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:38.160 align:middle line:90%
What will happen?

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:84%
So this is a way to introduce
a specifically human dimension.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.290 align:middle line:84%
We learned a lot
from other mammals.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to other
mammals, you learn

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:54.170 align:middle line:84%
that probably the very
first contact between mother

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and newborn baby is important.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Among mammals, it's
a critical period

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
for attachment between
mother and newborn baby.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.930 align:middle line:84%
A short period of time that
will never occur again.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
We learned that
from other mammals.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.020 align:middle line:84%
We learned a lot
from other mammals,

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:13.370 align:middle line:84%
but we have to resort to
introduce the specifically

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:90%
human characteristics.

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:18.280 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.290 align:middle line:84%
Today, we can easily
understand the point

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:29.020 align:middle line:84%
of view of many
doctors who think

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:84%
that in the future, probably,
most women will prefer

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:84%
to avoid the risk
associated with a birth

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.490 align:middle line:90%
by the vaginal route.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.520 align:middle line:84%
When I say that, I
use the terms used

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.150 align:middle line:84%
by the editor of "British
Journal of Obstetrics

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and Gynecology," which is the
point of view of many women

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.890 align:middle line:90%
obstetricians.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.520 align:middle line:84%
According to British
and American surveys,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.790 align:middle line:84%
many women obstetricians choose
to give birth by Cesarean

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:90%
section to their own babies.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:84%
We can understand
their point of view.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
If you only take into account
the conventional criteria

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.550 align:middle line:84%
to evaluate the
practices of obstetrics,

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
perinatal mortality, morbidity
rates, maternal mortality,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
morbidity rates, cost
effectiveness, that attitude,

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that point of view
is understandable.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
But we have to take into account
first, the subjective point

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:90%
of view of many people.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.300 align:middle line:84%
But also, what we learn
from modern sciences

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.890 align:middle line:84%
and people will claim that
Cesarean section for everybody

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.520 align:middle line:90%
is the future.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:84%
They don't take
into account what

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:84%
we learn at the present
time about the development

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:90%
of the capacity to love.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.480 align:middle line:84%
They don't take into account
that the hormones released

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.690 align:middle line:84%
with their babies
are hormone of love.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So they just ignore many
scientific advances.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.020 align:middle line:84%
They are only aware
of technical advances

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
but not about
scientific advances,

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.180 align:middle line:84%
incredible diversity
of scientific advances

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.640 align:middle line:84%
that oblige us to
think long term.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.190 align:middle line:90%


00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, to address the issue of the
place of birth, which includes

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:38.110 align:middle line:84%
the issue of out-of-hospital
birth or birth

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:84%
in birthing centers, we have
to recall what we can already

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:90%
learn from modern physiology.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to modern
physiology today,

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.580 align:middle line:84%
we can rediscover the
basic involvement in labor.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And often to reverse the
effect of many belief

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.620 align:middle line:90%
rituals, cultural conditioning.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.420 align:middle line:84%
So if we are to
summarize what we

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
can learn from several
concept that I can mention,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:25.460 align:middle line:84%
for example, the concept of
adrenaline/oxytocin antagonism.

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It means simply, when we release
adrenaline, emergency hormone,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.200 align:middle line:84%
adrenaline, that we
release when we are scared,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.200 align:middle line:84%
when we are cold,
when we feel observed,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.900 align:middle line:84%
we cannot release oxytocin,
the main hormone in childbirth.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Or when we take into
account the concept

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:90%
of neocortical inhibition.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.260 align:middle line:90%
That, I can explain briefly.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.340 align:middle line:84%
It mean, during
the birth process,

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.430 align:middle line:84%
when there are
inhibitions, the hormones

00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
come from the part of the brain
that is highly developed more

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:03.110 align:middle line:84%
humans, what we
call the neocortex,

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:06.490 align:middle line:90%
the brain of the intellect.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:90%
But the nature found a solution.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.880 align:middle line:84%
When a woman is giving
birth, the neocortex

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.480 align:middle line:90%
must stop working.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
So it means the neocortex of
women must not be stimulated.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
So when we take into account
such concept like that,

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.900 align:middle line:84%
physiological concept
like that, finally,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.150 align:middle line:90%
what are the other details?

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
We always come to
similar conclusions--

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:41.730 align:middle line:84%
one of them that laboring women
have universal basic needs.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:47.755 align:middle line:84%
All of them needs to feel
secure without feeling observed.

00:26:47.755 --> 00:26:50.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
That is a conclusion of
whatever the perspective,

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:84%
to feel secure, low
level of adrenaline,

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:02.170 align:middle line:84%
no stimulation of the neocortex
without feeling observed.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.320 align:middle line:84%
When you feel observed,
you observe yourself.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:90%
Your neocortex is stimulated.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.630 align:middle line:84%
You cannot release oxytocin
and so on and so on.

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So always, the same
conclusion-- basic

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:16.750 align:middle line:84%
need to feel secure
without feeling observed.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
So understanding that,
it's easy to explain

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
that if the basic
things are universal,

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:84%
there is also a
cultural conditioning.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And for some women, the
best way to feel secure

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.190 align:middle line:84%
can be to be in an
electronic environment.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Cultural conditioning--
so women need

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.640 align:middle line:84%
the beep, beep, beeps of her
hospital room to feel secure.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:84%
But there are also some
women who, when in labor,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:56.160 align:middle line:84%
feel more secure with an
experienced midwife, who is

00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.090 align:middle line:90%
perceived as a mother figure.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:90%
A midwife will sigh a lot.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:84%
That sigh a lot
does not stimulate

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.360 align:middle line:90%
the neocortex and sigh a lot.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
And for some women, this
is a way to feel secure.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.175 align:middle line:84%
So apparently, there are
differences between women,

00:28:15.175 --> 00:28:16.550 align:middle line:84%
although the basic
need is always

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:84%
the same-- to feel secure
without feeling observed.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
so important to offer

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.200 align:middle line:90%
as many options as possible.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Reality in childbirth is we
accept that the objective today

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.940 align:middle line:84%
would be that as many women
as possible on the planet

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.790 align:middle line:84%
give birth to their
baby and to the placenta

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the release of the
cocktail of love hormones.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.230 align:middle line:84%
If we accept that this would
be an objective, if we want

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:84%
to make the birth
as easy as possible,

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:84%
we must realize that there
are differences in terms

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.420 align:middle line:90%
of cultural conditioning.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
The need to offer many
options and the simple

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.540 align:middle line:84%
thought that women will give
birth under as either prisoners

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:90%
or of a choice.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.550 align:middle line:90%
A choice is intellectual.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:84%
But when in labor, some
women have a tendency

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.700 align:middle line:84%
to forget their
intellectual choice.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.060 align:middle line:84%
For example, I
know women who had

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.290 align:middle line:84%
planned a home birth,
intellectual plan,

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:28.770 align:middle line:90%
internal decision.

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it
didn't work at all.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
As soon as that they
went in the hospital

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:84%
with electronic machine
and medical equipment,

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:40.810 align:middle line:90%
they feel secure.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Baby was born.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:84%
And reverse, on
the reverse, I know

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:51.010 align:middle line:84%
women who intellectually
had planned a hospital birth

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:54.070 align:middle line:84%
like everybody, and
at the last minute,

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.250 align:middle line:84%
when they were ready to give
birth, no, I want to stay here.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to leave my house.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.600 align:middle line:84%
I want to-- and I've
been to several birth

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:84%
like that, of women
who, at the last minute,

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.310 align:middle line:90%
wanted to stay at home.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:84%
They could not find their
midwife because of the doctrine

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:11.330 align:middle line:90%
of the continuity of care.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Midwives are saying,
but we don't know you--

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.840 align:middle line:90%
continuity of care.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.430 align:middle line:84%
These women will follow
what they feel, rather

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.130 align:middle line:84%
than their
intellectual decision.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.050 align:middle line:84%
In general, they
give birth so easily.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is to say the point
is not to promote home birth,

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.420 align:middle line:84%
to promote birth in
hospital but to offer

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:38.650 align:middle line:84%
several possible options,
taking into account

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:41.800 align:middle line:84%
the cultural conditioning,
taking into account

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.380 align:middle line:84%
the universal need
of all pregnant women

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
to feel secure without
feeling observed.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:84%
At the present time, in
an urbanized society,

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:58.310 align:middle line:84%
we must not contrast home
birth with hospital birth.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:02.920 align:middle line:84%
What we have to learn
to do is to combine

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:08.350 align:middle line:84%
what the privacy of
the home can offer.

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Privacy is a basic
need, don't you never,

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.740 align:middle line:90%
not to feel observed?

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And whether hospital facilities
can offer, how to combine that.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.290 align:middle line:84%
This is the question
of our time.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.230 align:middle line:84%
We have to raise
the right question,

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.420 align:middle line:84%
because we are in
a new situation.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.210 align:middle line:90%
We are an urbanized society.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Many choices, but
these choices would be

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:90%
transformed into options open.
