00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Ina May Gaskin.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.080 align:middle line:84%
Started at the Farm
Midwifery Center.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.830 align:middle line:84%
My work as a midwife
started really in 1970,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.330 align:middle line:84%
summertime in
Tennessee, the farm.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The US is, as far as we
know, the first society

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
in the whole planet ever to
just eliminate midwifery.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.160 align:middle line:84%
When I saw my first birth
in the end of 1970--

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know this at the time.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:90%
But the caesarean rate was 5.5%.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:90%
So it was very rarely done.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew anybody
who had had one.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.985 align:middle line:84%
And we felt sorry for people
who'd had a caesarean.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:40.710 align:middle line:90%
And we thought, that must hurt.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
1980, it was up to 20%
just within a decade.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Elimination of breech
birth vaginally

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.910 align:middle line:84%
as a possibility, which
affected multiple pregnancies,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and the advent of
electronic fetal heart

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.580 align:middle line:90%
monitoring and the epidural.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.535 align:middle line:90%
Those things came in.

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:00.335 align:middle line:90%
Everything changed.

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.060 align:middle line:84%
In around 1980,
there was concern

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.430 align:middle line:84%
about this high,
high cesarean rate.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So there were
governmental efforts to--

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:90%
let's reduce it.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And let's bring
in virginal birth

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.110 align:middle line:84%
after caesarean, which was a
big no-no in North America.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But women started doing it
on their own unassisted.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.698 align:middle line:84%
And then midwives like me and
others said, you know, right.

00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
They ought to have
a chance for that.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we started
to accommodate that.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Also, you have to know that
we don't have a medical care

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.750 align:middle line:90%
system in the US.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:84%
We have the word-- the
language even switched.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It became an industry,
health care industry,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.880 align:middle line:84%
which meant for-profit
concerns were dominating.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And you didn't even have
the public health concerns

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.850 align:middle line:90%
that used to be assumed.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We began to lose
public hospitals.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So the emphasis became
on making a profit.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And for-profit
companies don't really

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.740 align:middle line:84%
have to think about good
outcomes, especially when you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
can mask them and make
people believe with all

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.490 align:middle line:84%
your technological magic that
you're doing better and better

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.920 align:middle line:90%
when, in fact, you're not.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So I would say right now that
you can keep a baby alive.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And that can look good
on neonatal death rates.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.080 align:middle line:84%
But baby might not be
in very good condition.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But we just assumed
in the US that mater--

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.170 align:middle line:90%
women don't die.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I found
out that they do.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.620 align:middle line:84%
I ran into a document that was
published in the late '90s that

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
said that the maternal death
rate in the US was grossly

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.110 align:middle line:84%
underreported and that the
real rate, not the one that--

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the one that's
officially reported

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.260 align:middle line:90%
is one thing.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.390 align:middle line:84%
But the real rate could
be three times that.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.708 align:middle line:84%
The US officially reported
rate is very high related

00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:14.750 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the world.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.180 align:middle line:84%
It used to be we
were ranked 20th.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years later,
I saw we ranked 30th.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
This was according to the World
Health Organization figures.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.690 align:middle line:84%
And then 40th-- that was
reported in my latest book.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned around
about a month later

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
after my newest
book, and we're 50th.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know we don't
even deserve that.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And we don't report
consistently across the country.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So really, any country
that's imitating the US

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:90%
ought to be aware of that.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of like we are racing
down the highway as fast as we

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.750 align:middle line:84%
could possibly go with
a whole lot of muck

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:90%
on the windshield and no brakes.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I noticed a wall of, we're
not going to listen to you.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to see it.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.320 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to
look at this problem.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.113 align:middle line:84%
So I was going, oh, we
don't want feedback.

00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:15.280 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to get better.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
We want to just keep
repeating that we're the best.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm speaking of my country
here, my beloved country.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, I know all
these women who've died.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I've talked to their relatives.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.540 align:middle line:84%
I've got to get through
this because surely there

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.020 align:middle line:84%
would be something that would
unite people on maternity care

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:90%
policy.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.362 align:middle line:84%
It would be that
the mother shouldn't

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:38.930 align:middle line:90%
die when you could prevent it.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And when the numbers
are something like--

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:84%
nonpreventable deaths
would be something

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:90%
like 3 to 100,000 births.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And now in New York City,
if you're African American,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:90%
we're up to about 80.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's tripled in California
between 1996 and 2006,

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
largely because of
too many C-sections.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.040 align:middle line:90%
We've got to turn that around.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.905 align:middle line:84%
So about in the late
'90s, I thought,

00:05:07.905 --> 00:05:09.530 align:middle line:84%
there was a health
care problem that we

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.260 align:middle line:84%
had in the early
'80s, the mid '80s.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.700 align:middle line:90%
That was the AIDS crisis.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And we had a president that
didn't want to look at it.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And this was very influential
for the whole world as well.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And what made him look
at it was activists

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.710 align:middle line:84%
started making a quilt and
putting people's names on it.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, hey,
I can do that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.690 align:middle line:84%
So each one death
I could find out

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.890 align:middle line:84%
that occurred since the 1980s,
which was our lowest maternal

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:90%
death rate--

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
we're more than
twice that high now--

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:90%
I made a piece.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And so they're long panels
about 5 meters long,

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:90%
20 names on each quilt piece.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've got enough for 17 of
those, each one with 20 names.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.950 align:middle line:84%
I've got more than our
hospital quality assurance

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
organization has
because it just does

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:90%
voluntary admissions of deaths.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.040 align:middle line:90%
And so I take this around.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.660 align:middle line:90%
I put it up on my website.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:84%
You can read the
women's stories.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm able to learn things
that our government has not

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.600 align:middle line:84%
put together the
infrastructure to get.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I had an opportunity
to learn about birth

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.500 align:middle line:90%
that can't be done anymore.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was nothing
wrong with my body.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I knew I hadn't needed
a forceps birth.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't get it
through my mind how

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.020 align:middle line:84%
this obstetrician,
who had been maybe

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:90%
at 1,000 births or even more--

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
why did he think
that I needed forceps

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.980 align:middle line:90%
when he didn't even let me try?

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, there
is no other mammal

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:84%
that's automatically destroying
its firstborn's brain just

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:90%
through the process of birth.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:90%
How can you be so nuts as that?

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I realized
how much superstition there

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is in modern-day medicine
as applied to obstetrics.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And this is particularly
so, I found out,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in the US because
we had no midwives

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
for half a century and not
a single midwifery textbook

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:90%
before the 1970s.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Not one.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So you had to have
a movement that

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.810 align:middle line:84%
came that was truly grassroots
that went, let's go back

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.610 align:middle line:84%
to basics here because
something's wrong over here.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And we proved that there's
nothing wrong with the North

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.980 align:middle line:90%
American woman's pelvis.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have this
cephalopelvic disproportion

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:84%
thing that we were told that we
were so mongrelized that we had

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
had these tiny
pelvises, and we had

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.500 align:middle line:84%
these giant, cabbage-headed
babies that couldn't get out.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I learned that it takes
kindness for a woman

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:84%
to be able to relax enough
to let her baby be born.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And that can be labeled a
dysfunction of her body.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:90%
But it's actually her--

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:84%
monkey, as I would say,
is working perfectly well.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.900 align:middle line:84%
Women cannot give birth
very well when they're being

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
harassed, just like a cow
doesn't do well or any mammal

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:26.970 align:middle line:84%
doesn't give birth well when
something's making her feel

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.760 align:middle line:90%
stressed and attacked.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the things
that happen to you

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:84%
in modern hospital routines,
unless you're really, really,

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.090 align:middle line:84%
really frightened, in which case
maybe that can be comforting--

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't feel good to
have an IV put in your arm

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:84%
or a needle in your back or
somebody rather brusk and not

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.070 align:middle line:84%
in a very good mood telling
you better lie down flat

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
or they can't get
that precious paper

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:84%
strip or the electronic
fetal monitoring

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
to make it look as if somebody
is really looking after you

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:90%
and then leave you alone.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
So you don't need to be insulted
when you're giving birth.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.625 align:middle line:84%
And when you do it
in the US-- and then

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:07.875 align:middle line:90%
you have to pay out of pocket.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Very essential knowledge has
been lost in the 20th century.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It's fascinating how
it happens, really.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really learn it
myself until I assisted maybe

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:90%
40-some births.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.080 align:middle line:84%
But I actually saw a woman,
a very good friend of mine,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
go backwards in labor, very
quietly went backwards.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:84%
She was almost to
the point-- and this

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.870 align:middle line:84%
was her first baby-- of opening
enough to start pushing.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:43.427 align:middle line:84%
And all that time, she
had been enjoying herself.

00:09:43.427 --> 00:09:45.010 align:middle line:84%
She and her husband
were good friends,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:49.810 align:middle line:84%
were sort of laughing and
joking in between contractions,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:51.070 align:middle line:90%
rushes, I'd rather call them.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.480 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, whatever.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And so then she became really
quiet and very serious.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And I started to wonder,
where is this labor going,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:90%
because it was all calming down.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her if she'd
mind if I rechecked.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And I found out instead
of being open this much,

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:90%
she was now back to here.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know that was possible.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd never read about it
and never observed it.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I just thought,
well, I know there's

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.130 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with your cervix.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Your uterus is
performing very nicely.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Your mood, however, has changed.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.470 align:middle line:84%
So let's just change it back
to what you were before.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest you regain
her sense of humor,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:90%
laugh at my silly jokes.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And you know what
happened when she did?

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:90%
She reopened.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
that's really good.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So then I went looking
for it in the books

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:84%
because I think if
you have something

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that's a biological
phenomena, you should

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.220 align:middle line:90%
be able to read about it.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't there.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And I became fascinated
by that because it

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.348 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in the obstetrics texts.

00:10:50.348 --> 00:10:51.640 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't in the nursing texts.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And yet experienced
nurses reported

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.250 align:middle line:90%
experiencing this to happen.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, don't you
ever tell the doctors about it?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, they
always say we're wrong.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, you're
the one that do all the--

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.648 align:middle line:84%
you're the ones that
do all the checking.

00:11:05.648 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:84%
So it appears that because your
salary isn't as high as theirs,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.440 align:middle line:84%
they're saying you're
wrong when you are really

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:90%
the more experienced person.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.390 align:middle line:84%
So it was only when I went
into the 19th-century books,

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
when the doctors themselves
were doing home births, that I--

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:21.920 align:middle line:90%
there I found it.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was in almost every
textbook at that time.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, that's
something that

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is a product of when
people were in their homes.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.500 align:middle line:84%
And it was all in a more
person-to-person basis.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Older doctors would tell
the younger doctor, who

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.370 align:middle line:84%
would always be male, if you
want the labor to go well,

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
don't go in a room till the
women let you in because you'll

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
stop the labor.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And in some cases, the
woman was on the point

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:90%
of the baby's head being born.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
The doctor shows up
instead of the midwife.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was the last
pain she had for two

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:90%
weeks or, in one case, 19 days.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.107 align:middle line:90%
This is big.

00:12:04.107 --> 00:12:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, how
do we explain this?

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.273 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
I think I'm going

00:12:07.273 --> 00:12:13.030 align:middle line:84%
to call it "sphincter law"
because a woman's cervix works

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:84%
much as the sphincters that
we all know and experience.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And we know quite well that
you can't order them to open.

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And they don't open
as well when we

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.670 align:middle line:84%
have a bunch of potentially
hostile people threatening us

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:90%
with sharp instruments.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.050 align:middle line:90%
And we just can't will--

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.120 align:middle line:90%
they're shy.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:90%
They're shy.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.450 align:middle line:90%
So that's just one example.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's another one that's
really fascinating me recently

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
because we had a report in 19--

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
no, sorry, 2007 of a woman in
North Carolina who it was only

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
discovered that she wasn't
pregnant at C-section.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:90%
How did that happen?

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.600 align:middle line:90%
A combination of things.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Most US medical
schools, it appears,

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
have quit teaching
their junior doctors

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to put their hands
on women and to feel

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.100 align:middle line:84%
the abdomen for the
growing uterus, which

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.020 align:middle line:90%
is quite palpable.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.240 align:middle line:84%
But they go, we have
these visual technologies.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're such fun.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.890 align:middle line:90%
Ultrasound is such fun.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's only as good as
the person reading it.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you can mistake some
impacted poo for a pregnancy,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
you're not very good
at what you're doing.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.160 align:middle line:84%
But it seems it's pretty
easy to make that mistake--

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.080 align:middle line:84%
and then, later on, another
ultrasound to not, of course,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.470 align:middle line:90%
detect a heartbeat.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Who doesn't have a heart?

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.670 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And so you've got a woman
who wants to be pregnant.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Her body can mimic the
signs of pregnancy.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And this phenomenon
exists in other mammals.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean we're crazy
when we experience it.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But it is called a
"false pregnancy,"

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
a "spurious pregnancy,"
or "pseudocyesis."

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's no longer in
US obstetrics textbooks.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:84%
It was edited out, apparently,
as not very important knowledge

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:90%
in the '90s.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But it was in every
textbook before that.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just appalled that
now women in my country

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
are in danger of
having a C-section

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.920 align:middle line:84%
when they're not even
pregnant because of ignorance.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand it.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women who
want a home birth

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:90%
have already tried the hospital.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.170 align:middle line:84%
And they've had sometimes
sadistic treatment,

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
sometimes really wrong, wrong
treatment, their needs not met.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And many times these
women really, like me--

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.830 align:middle line:90%
hey, I was one of these women.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
I had to reinvent
a profession that I

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.450 align:middle line:84%
didn't know anything about in
order to get a decent birth.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't have gone
into a hospital in the US

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:84%
and had a good birth after
I had my first really--

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I knew I could labor.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.630 align:middle line:84%
I labored for many, many
hours with no anesthesia.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.730 align:middle line:90%
I was in a beautiful trance.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.390 align:middle line:84%
The wall was giving
me beautiful colors.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:90%
I was not unhappy.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.570 align:middle line:90%
I was not screaming.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't make any trouble.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet they forced this
crazy forceps delivery on me.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I went, it took me
right out of that great trance.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.200 align:middle line:90%
I would have pushed just fine.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I think I would have been a much
better mother if they had left

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.010 align:middle line:84%
me alone and let
me be with my baby

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and not rush her off and keep
her away from me for two days.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.280 align:middle line:90%
So I was depressed.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have that word.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't weeping.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.560 align:middle line:90%
But I was a frightened person.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that a new mother
should not be frightened,

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
especially not with irrational
fears like driving home

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.580 align:middle line:84%
from the hospital that my baby
could somehow leap off my lap

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and go out through the
crack of the window and get

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:90%
run over by the car behind me.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.150 align:middle line:84%
I knew that was an
irrational fear,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.910 align:middle line:84%
but, I couldn't keep these
things from coming up.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.180 align:middle line:90%
So you don't mistreat a mother.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.200 align:middle line:84%
We are the only
species of mammal

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.310 align:middle line:90%
that mistreats our mothers.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And we expect them to be able
to suck it up and perform

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.070 align:middle line:84%
like the perfect
mother after we've

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:90%
harassed these young moms.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So that's why women
need choice, you see,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
because we are so
superstitious about technology.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.570 align:middle line:90%
And I love my computer, too.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And I love my little
car and everything.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.630 align:middle line:84%
But you know, when it
comes to having babies,

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.460 align:middle line:84%
you just let me give
this body a try,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.890 align:middle line:90%
and I'll show you something.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:90%
Not as a grandma.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.250 align:middle line:90%
I don't want it.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Grandmas aren't supposed
to unless you can get

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:90%
pregnant the old-fashioned way.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Just leave that to
the other girls.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.329 align:middle line:84%
So you need choice
for so many reasons.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.790 align:middle line:84%
We need to listen to
women why we need choice.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.680 align:middle line:90%
They'll tell you.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But it's to keep the
kindness in our species.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.619 align:middle line:90%
It's to get to--

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.569 align:middle line:84%
if we didn't do this,
we wouldn't even

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:24.540 align:middle line:84%
know that oxytocin is
produced in our own bodies.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't come
in little vials.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's oxytocin that
keeps labor going well

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.200 align:middle line:84%
and is the hormone of love
and curiosity and calmness

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.820 align:middle line:90%
and caring.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And the endorphins that
our bodies also produce

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:90%
is an opiate.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the very best one.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:84%
It's the one with no unpleasant
or dangerous side effects.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:90%
So let our bodies--

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.160 align:middle line:84%
are just a wonderful
chemical producer of stuff

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.790 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't give any
pharmaceutical company profits.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
But let us have that knowledge
that our bodies are sacred.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And then let's keep
our hospitals there.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And let's let them
be distributed,

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.790 align:middle line:90%
even in the rural areas.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to having a small
community hospital out where

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.710 align:middle line:90%
it's more sparsely populated.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.850 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.550 align:middle line:84%
We just don't need to have
everybody traveling for three,

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.220 align:middle line:84%
four hours because then people
get in car accidents on the way

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.020 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:39.850 align:middle line:84%
What impact us choice have on
safety for baby and for mother?

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Like it or not, that
baby is eventually

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
going to go home from the
hospital with its mother.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:90%
Mothers are really important.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have
to stop seeing mothers

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.460 align:middle line:90%
as an obstacle to safety.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Birth is more than getting
body A out of body B,

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.460 align:middle line:84%
which is somehow less
important than body A.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.290 align:middle line:90%
So you know what?

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes babies aren't
going to make it.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.590 align:middle line:90%
And we have to accept that.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
And we have to quit looking
for people to blame.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:84%
If you are designing a
system that will never

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.130 align:middle line:90%
have a mistake in it, dream on.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.210 align:middle line:90%
There is human error.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
conditions that

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
can happen that, sorry, the
baby isn't going to make it.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Not every child is
going to make it.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And sadly, too,
that 3 per 100,000

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of nonpreventable maternal
deaths will also happen.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's not perfect in that
way, but nature's pretty good.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's pretty good.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a healthy
midwifery profession that

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:52.030 align:middle line:84%
can really hold
its head up where

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.280 align:middle line:84%
the majority of your
maternity care providers

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.070 align:middle line:90%
in any country are midwives--

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and then you also have your
obstetricians, your doctors,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:84%
whether GP or obstetricians,
not so numerous.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And they have to
have mutual respect.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:90%
So one is for the problems.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And one is for the vast
majority of births.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
If there is good prenatal
education, if there's good diet

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.380 align:middle line:84%
and there's good
system integration,

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.900 align:middle line:84%
now you're going to have the
optimum situation for mother

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%
and baby.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to lose
the fewest mothers.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
lose the fewest babies.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And the babies
who come are going

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
to be in the best condition
because they, too,

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.140 align:middle line:84%
are handled with the
kind of tenderness

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:84%
that we would expect any child
to give a kitten or a puppy

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.450 align:middle line:90%
when they hold them.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
And I see rough
treatment of our newborns

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.310 align:middle line:84%
at birth all the time
in hospitals as if--

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
just plunk down
that piece of meat.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.040 align:middle line:90%
And get it out of my hands.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:90%
And oh, it's wet and yucky.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:90%
And oh, it's screaming.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.640 align:middle line:84%
There's something really,
really wrong with that.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think some of
our children never

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.270 align:middle line:84%
overcome that fear
that they absorb

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:84%
at birth of that
rough treatment,

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.987 align:middle line:84%
that lack of a welcoming voice
that went, hey, you're here.

00:21:10.987 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:90%
And we're glad to see you.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.910 align:middle line:90%
And here's your mom.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:84%
I know you want to be with
her more than with me.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.360 align:middle line:90%
Here she is.

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And you put that baby
on the mom's chest.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon you
see they're just

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:84%
as good as any other
little mammal at surviving.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.060 align:middle line:84%
If we want to look
where we're headed--

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to say, most
of the wealthy countries are

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:84%
heading in the wrong direction
with respect to their maternity

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.320 align:middle line:84%
care policy because they're
blindly following the country

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:84%
that they least should follow--
and that would be the United

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:90%
States--

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.030 align:middle line:84%
without realizing
the United States

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
has been following
Brazil for a long time.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.120 align:middle line:84%
There are certain US
obstetrical leaders

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.780 align:middle line:84%
who were holding out Brazil
as the model that we should

00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:01.570 align:middle line:84%
be following because the wealthy
women there were choosing--

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.540 align:middle line:84%
obviously, choosing in
the private hospitals--

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:84%
caesarean instead
of vaginal birth.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a hospital
a few years ago

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that had a C-section rate
of 95% even though they

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:19.120 align:middle line:84%
had a nice, little birthing
room that nobody wanted to use.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And when I was talking
to some young women--

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:84%
educated women in a
university at the time--

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
they were afraid to even look
at a photo of a woman giving

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.960 align:middle line:84%
birth in ecstasy without
any sort of medical--

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
any surgery drugs or any sort of
intervention to her first baby.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And the young men in the room
would look with curiosity

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.630 align:middle line:90%
at it.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And the young women
closed their eyes

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
when I tried to show
them this photo.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's how deep
the fear can be.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to brainwash the
female population now and today

00:22:55.870 --> 00:23:00.010 align:middle line:84%
about how bad a
creation their body is.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And now they become so
pathologically afraid

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that it can be manipulated by
all the profit-making entities

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:11.560 align:middle line:84%
that you can think of that
could better themselves

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.740 align:middle line:84%
by everyone having a
surgical birth except those

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.180 align:middle line:90%
who couldn't get there.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is
you have obstetricians

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
that don't know anything anymore
about how to turn a baby,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:84%
how to diagnose a pregnancy,
how to comfort a woman in labor

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.680 align:middle line:84%
when you don't have an
operating room right over there,

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.840 align:middle line:84%
or when a woman is
giving birth so quickly,

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
as quite a few women will,
that you don't have time

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:35.620 align:middle line:90%
to cut her open.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>> So is there any hope?

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:90%
How can we fix it?

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.900 align:middle line:90%
>> There is hope.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.190 align:middle line:90%
And women can fix it.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:90%
And we need men to help us.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And we need to have
that protective,

00:23:53.020 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
warrior-without-weapons spirit
among the men, that father

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.700 align:middle line:90%
thing that other species do.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, the male of
the other mammalian species

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
does not attack
the laboring woman

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.730 align:middle line:84%
or harass her-- the
laboring female.

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:13.700 align:middle line:84%
You could even
have the lion, who

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:84%
is going to kill the kits
of some of the lionesses.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.390 align:middle line:84%
But he will not
disturb her in labor.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So we're the only one
that's doing that.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's a product
of technology,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:84%
you see, because we
fool ourselves to think,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:84%
just because we can do these
amazingly amazing things

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:84%
with technology-- so we
can make eyesight better.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
We can get in there and
tinker with the heart.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.853 align:middle line:84%
We cannot make a better uterus
or better vagina than women

00:24:42.853 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
come equipped with,
thank you very much.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.860 align:middle line:84%
So I remember once
some of the feedback

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.640 align:middle line:84%
I got showing some video
was these residents--

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.030 align:middle line:84%
OBGYN registrars,
junior doctors--

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:02.380 align:middle line:84%
had never seen an
intact perineum.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.350 align:middle line:84%
And they called it
doing an Ina May.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said, the secret is
you don't make her hurry up.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.965 align:middle line:90%
You just go slowly here.

00:25:10.965 --> 00:25:11.840 align:middle line:90%
We're not in a hurry.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:90%
There's no panic.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:90%
There's no danger to the baby.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We're coming out
of a soft place.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Take it easy.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's just one thing.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, what are some other things?

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, I remember reading
in the mid '80s about--

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.890 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
feared complications

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:31.350 align:middle line:90%
is shoulder dystocia.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:90%
The baby's head has been born.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.470 align:middle line:84%
And now the shoulders are
wedged in there such a way

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:84%
that this baby can die or
be frightfully injured,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:44.200 align:middle line:84%
have an arm that doesn't
work if you don't

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:90%
handle this in the right way.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So there is a lot of cutting
and tugging and twisting

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:90%
and stuff like that.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately, I had
a trip to Guatemala.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And I learned from a
formally trained midwife

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.580 align:middle line:84%
who learned from the indigenous
and illiterate midwives a far

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.660 align:middle line:90%
better way, which--

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.910 align:middle line:90%
turn the woman over.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And the baby will
usually fall out.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:12.190 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went back
home and a few months

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.830 align:middle line:84%
later I had such a case,
the friend of mine--

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.950 align:middle line:90%
I asked her to turn over.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And sure enough, baby fell out.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.730 align:middle line:90%
And so I told my partners.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:90%
We did that.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:90%
We never had a problem.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there
was a US obstetrician.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And this article was
published about his technique,

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:90%
which was revolutionary.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was to rotate
the baby's head once out

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and push the entire baby's
head back into the uterus

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.910 align:middle line:84%
and then perform an
emergency C-section.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:90%
And I think he had nine cases.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And the results really
weren't very good.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:50.920 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was
reading a satire,

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.270 align:middle line:90%
but it turned out to be real.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.430 align:middle line:90%
So it took a long process.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.640 align:middle line:84%
It took more than a decade
to get that teaching across

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and to gather up
enough cases that I

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:84%
was able to get it published
in a medical journal,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:90%
in the GP's journal.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And then it took another
decade before I could get it

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:middle line:90%
into an obstetric journal.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.980 align:middle line:84%
It's there now in
many countries.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.050 align:middle line:84%
But it's still at the
bottom of the list.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've been told
by some obstetricians

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that it was the only
one that worked.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So I'm kind of going,
maybe you ought

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.560 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the ability
to move the woman

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:84%
or to let her move on her own
because her pelvis is actually

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.560 align:middle line:84%
greater diameter when she's
in an all-fours position

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.140 align:middle line:84%
than it is when
she's on her back

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:84%
or seated because she's
then pushing her tailbone up

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.990 align:middle line:84%
toward her front pubic bone
and decreasing that diameter.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.740 align:middle line:84%
When she turns over,
it lifts, opens.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we
generate such this--

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
how do medical
science miss the fact

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.790 align:middle line:84%
that the woman is
in a better position

00:28:03.790 --> 00:28:06.670 align:middle line:84%
to give birth on all
fours than on her back?

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply because
medical anatomical science

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:84%
is based upon the study of
the dead person, where rigor

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.710 align:middle line:90%
mortis has long since set in.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And midwifery is
based on the living,

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.270 align:middle line:90%
breathing, and moving woman.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:28.330 align:middle line:90%


00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Obstetricians and
doctors in general

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:84%
need to respect midwifery
and women's knowledge

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and learn from it, just
as we respect theirs.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.430 align:middle line:90%
And we learn from it, too.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But there is this
delicate balance

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.940 align:middle line:90%
that has to be maintained.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.590 align:middle line:90%
And we always need balance.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.210 align:middle line:84%
What I always thought
would be interesting is

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:56.870 align:middle line:84%
that if an obstetrician who
believes that home birth is so

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:03.440 align:middle line:84%
dangerous could look at our
data from the Farm Midwifery

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Center, where--

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anybody else
that's done this, shown

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.130 align:middle line:84%
you the outcome
from the first birth

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:14.810 align:middle line:84%
they ever saw and then went
right on through for 40 years--

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:19.430 align:middle line:84%
maintaining a C-section
rate under 2%.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And so for 800 of those
women, it was the whole town.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.910 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't say,
oh, well, look.

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.940 align:middle line:90%
Your bottom's too small.

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't live here.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Or, your husband's too big.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:34.640 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:35.840 align:middle line:90%
We didn't do that.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, we didn't have
very many cigarette smokers.

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.460 align:middle line:90%
But why was that?

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.560 align:middle line:90%
Because we said, you know what?

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:90%
Let's don't smoke.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's don't.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's just don't get
fetal alcohol syndrome.

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have enough money to
waste it on a lot of drinking.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And so we were free
from certain things.

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.800 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have diabetes
because we just

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.040 align:middle line:84%
had this good diet because
we were raising our food.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And we were enjoying
our veggies.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And we were eating
enough protein.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't have junk food
because we couldn't afford it.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So all of those things are
part of midwifery, you see?

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:19.820 align:middle line:84%
And midwives can get women
to change lifestyle habits.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I had people come in
who were cocaine users.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.590 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
stay here, sorry.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to do any of that.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:32.590 align:middle line:84%
You just had your last
cigarette or leave.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.490 align:middle line:90%
And then we fed them up.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And they did well
and could give birth.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of midwifery is like
early education of women.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's also,
let's do things that

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:90%
maintain our fertility, too.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm horrified by
the trend that's

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.950 align:middle line:84%
now going in the US, where
young women in their 20s

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
who have more money than
they know what to do with

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.660 align:middle line:84%
are going off and having their
eggs harvested and frozen

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid that it's
going to take them another 10

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.980 align:middle line:84%
years to find a chance
where they feel like they'd

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.080 align:middle line:90%
be ready to be a parent.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.610 align:middle line:90%
And now their eggs are too old.

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So they've been frightened
by the silly statistics that

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.370 align:middle line:84%
are almost meaningless to
doing these things that--

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're really going
to trust all those freezers?

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And have you read the stats
on how well these artificially

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.580 align:middle line:90%
implanted pregnancies are doing?

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:84%
These babies do not
have as good a chance

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.990 align:middle line:84%
as they would if you really had
a little more knowledge here.

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So I think that
women are functioning

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:43.640 align:middle line:90%
on not enough knowledge.

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think obstetricians too
often are also functioning

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.130 align:middle line:90%
on little knowledge.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:52.340 align:middle line:84%
In the United States, it's
a rare obstetrician anymore

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.700 align:middle line:84%
who knows what postpartum
care should consist of.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So along with this
high C-section rate,

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.550 align:middle line:84%
we have a high death rate
from pulmonary embolisms

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.250 align:middle line:84%
simply because women
don't know that they're

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:11.510 align:middle line:84%
in danger after they've
had this major surgery.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.230 align:middle line:84%
If they go home and they
have a pain in the leg--

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and nobody is going to visit
you no matter how well you're

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.650 align:middle line:90%
insured in the US.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.550 align:middle line:84%
It's rare that you get
a postpartum visit.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.380 align:middle line:90%
You only have a phone call.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And you might not
think-- hey, I feel good.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.000 align:middle line:90%
Never mind that pain in my leg.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And I have a lot of
women on the quilt

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.245 align:middle line:84%
because they weren't told
they would be in danger.

00:32:33.245 --> 00:32:36.700 align:middle line:90%


00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:84%
I think one factor
that scared women

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.850 align:middle line:90%
in my part of the world a lot--

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:50.252 align:middle line:84%
and maybe the '90s is when I
really started to notice it.

00:32:50.252 --> 00:32:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
women started clamoring

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.310 align:middle line:90%
for C-sections-- certain women.

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
because it became

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:07.080 align:middle line:84%
popular to lampoon natural birth
in comedy series coming out

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:07.950 align:middle line:90%
of Hollywood.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.870 align:middle line:90%
It began to go into the films.

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:13.170 align:middle line:84%
So you either had
this ridiculing

00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.560 align:middle line:84%
of people to be so crazy
as to have a home birth--

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and they were all
stupid people and not

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.770 align:middle line:84%
likely to be good mothers
and objects of ridicule,

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.580 align:middle line:90%
really, gross.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:29.010 align:middle line:84%
So that was the
stereotypical view of birth

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.830 align:middle line:84%
without submitting to
all the technology.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And then you also had
drama likes danger.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you wanted
the adrenaline birth.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you had the woman who
suddenly goes into labor.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And now we're off
to the hospital.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And then somebody dies
and that kind of thing.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:90%
And so that really scared women.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Then you put that
together with these birth

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.850 align:middle line:84%
shows that became popular with
the cable and the satellite

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:90%
shows.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And so you were seeing real
gritty births, supposedly,

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:84%
but always women on their
backs with an epidural.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're just enduring
this horrible thing

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.139 align:middle line:84%
that the poor women
have to go through.

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And you always saw
birth as an ordeal.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you would
go, oh, the real thing

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.810 align:middle line:84%
must be really horrible
if this is the good thing.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And so then when you
would see the C-section,

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:31.290 align:middle line:90%
it's so sanitized.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:34.560 align:middle line:84%
And most people aren't
media sophisticated to know

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.261 align:middle line:90%
how edited everything is.

00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:38.219 align:middle line:84%
And if they'd really been
in the operating room

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:39.886 align:middle line:84%
and saw everything,
they would come away

00:34:39.886 --> 00:34:41.580 align:middle line:90%
with a different idea.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.659 align:middle line:84%
Or if they saw the woman on the
few hours after the C-section,

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:49.440 align:middle line:84%
when now she's got to get up
and move so that she's not

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:55.080 align:middle line:84%
in danger of a deep vein
thrombosis, how much pain she's

00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.050 align:middle line:84%
in, and how long it's going
to be before she can lift

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:03.150 align:middle line:84%
their leg without pain, you'd
have a whole different view

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:84%
if you saw how much blood
is lost in a C-section.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.180 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you only
see the good C-sections.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:84%
So I think that if we could
see real birth on television--

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.270 align:middle line:84%
and I tried to get
mine out there.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:21.900 align:middle line:84%
They can't be seen because
sometimes a pubic hair is seen.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So we are so
puritanical in the US.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.825 align:middle line:84%
I've had Australians tell me,
well, we got the convicts.

00:35:28.825 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:90%
You got the Puritans.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.520 align:middle line:90%
We got the better deal.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And I know what
they're talking about.

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
though, the US seems

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.510 align:middle line:84%
to be the world leader
in childbirth style.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's a real shame
unless more people

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.560 align:middle line:84%
can get that the US home birth
movement, which is actually

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.460 align:middle line:90%
growing--

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:55.140 align:middle line:84%
we've now grown to
1% of all births.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's taken 40 years.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:90%
But I'm encouraged by it.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.260 align:middle line:90%
It could grow more.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:90%


00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.220 align:middle line:84%
I got a phone call soon after we
made a video of a breech birth.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And it was bought by many
hospitals and by midwives

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:16.650 align:middle line:90%
all over the country.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And I got a call
because this nurse

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.770 align:middle line:84%
was very upset about a
birth that had taken place

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.430 align:middle line:84%
where a young woman had
come in rapidly delivering

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.590 align:middle line:90%
a breech baby.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.110 align:middle line:84%
The doctor was very
flustered and clearly

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:84%
had no knowledge of
what to do because it

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.690 align:middle line:84%
hadn't been taught for a
while in this guy's training.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:39.750 align:middle line:90%
So the baby's body delivered.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, the
anesthetist came in.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And that young doctor
asked the anesthetist

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to put the woman
out unconscious.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.490 align:middle line:90%
Whatever for?

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how you get
the baby's whole body back

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:54.930 align:middle line:90%
in the woman to do a C-section.

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:90%
And why else would you do it?

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.400 align:middle line:90%
So the baby died.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And she wanted that doctor
to see that a breech baby can

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:08.320 align:middle line:84%
be born with little difficulty
with even an intact perineum.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:12.480 align:middle line:84%
But of course, he didn't
want to see the video.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.770 align:middle line:84%
There was another case
that happened in Florida.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:90%
And this was to the--

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.290 align:middle line:84%
we had a Florida
senator at the time.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter-in-law was
about to have her second baby.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And she planned to
go to the hospital.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.570 align:middle line:84%
The problem was that
when she went into labor,

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.670 align:middle line:84%
it happened too fast
for her to get there.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.260 align:middle line:84%
She couldn't even get out
the driveway to the car.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.870 align:middle line:90%
She just got downstairs.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:90%
The baby's coming.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So her husband calls
the emergency number.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And we've got a bunch of
paramedics responding.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And they do not know what
to do with a breech baby.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.160 align:middle line:90%
In this case, the body was born.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, a second
ambulance was on its way.

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And this time, we
had a midwife aboard.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:90%
And she was one of those--

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:84%
she was not a formally
trained nurse midwife.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.530 align:middle line:84%
She was my type, who
learned from apprenticeship

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.350 align:middle line:84%
with doctors and
experience with women.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And she then came in
and saved the day.

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.410 align:middle line:84%
She knew how to get the head
born, and the baby was fine.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And this was announced on
the floor of the US Senate.
