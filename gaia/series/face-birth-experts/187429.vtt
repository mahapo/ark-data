00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.757 align:middle line:90%
>>: Hi, I'm Robbie Davis-Flyod.

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:06.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm a Senior Research Fellow in
the Department of Anthropology

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.560 align:middle line:84%
at the University
of Texas-Austin.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm a specialist in
medical anthropology

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and cultural anthropology
and the anthropology

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.180 align:middle line:84%
of reproduction, especially
focusing on childbirth delivery

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:90%
and obstetrics.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.500 align:middle line:84%
I've been studying
birth and birth related

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.610 align:middle line:84%
matters for the last
almost 30 years, I guess.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I got interested in that
subject because my first child

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.830 align:middle line:84%
was born by cesarean and
I couldn't figure out why.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.258 align:middle line:84%
It didn't seem to me like it
was a necessary operation.

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I had to do a lot of
research to figure out that it

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.570 align:middle line:90%
wasn't.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I started wondering
why I got hoodwinked

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.930 align:middle line:90%
into a cesarean I didn't want.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.577 align:middle line:84%
I started-- being
an anthropologist,

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
I naturally started
asking other women

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.420 align:middle line:90%
about their birth experiences.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what we do when we

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.203 align:middle line:84%
want to understand
something, we start

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:50.680 align:middle line:90%
asking a lot of questions.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Our bottom line question
in anthropology is, why?

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.150 align:middle line:90%
Why did this happen this way?

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.230 align:middle line:90%
Why did you do this, this way?

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
Why did you make this choice,
and what does it mean?

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.212 align:middle line:84%
Those are our two most
important questions,

00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:02.780 align:middle line:90%
why and what does it mean?

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So I spent about
six or seven months

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
getting interested in
the field and questioning

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:84%
women about their
own experiences,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
questioning myself about why I
ended up with that experience.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And then it was time to take my
dissertation advisor to lunch

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:90%
and pick a dissertation topic.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
And she said, so
what's it gonna be?

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
I've been studying

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.613 align:middle line:84%
myth ritual and shamanism in
Mexico for several years now.

00:01:28.613 --> 00:01:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was gonna be
that, but lately I've gotten

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.230 align:middle line:90%
interested in this other thing.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.938 align:middle line:84%
There's something
really strange going on

00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:90%
with birth in the United States.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's such a
standardized procedure.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Every woman has her own
unique experience of it,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.190 align:middle line:84%
but the hospitals
and the doctors

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.670 align:middle line:84%
treated in this very
institutional standardized way.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.530 align:middle line:90%
So I'm wondering, why is that?

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.780 align:middle line:90%
And I said, what do you think?

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.270 align:middle line:84%
And she said shamanism,
shamanism, shamanism.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Everybody and their dog
is studying shamanism.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.030 align:middle line:90%
She said, you do women things.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:90%
You do birth.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:90%
And I said, OK.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
What birth is like in the
United States right now

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely interventionist.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have normal birth
in my country anymore.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
I can say that with
some authority.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.440 align:middle line:84%
We have done major surveys
of women, Harris Poll style

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.000 align:middle line:84%
surveys, called
Listening to Women,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that are conducted by Childbirth
Connection, a birth activist

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.060 align:middle line:90%
group in New York.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And out of all the women
interviewed, maybe 3% of them

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.150 align:middle line:90%
had normal births in hospitals.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the only place
you're gonna find normal,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
un-interventionist spontaneous

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
birth, in the United States
today is at home or in birth

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:90%
centers--

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.370 align:middle line:90%
plus 3% in hospitals.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else has
highly interventionist

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:90%
births-- everybody.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Doctors in my country
don't even know

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.440 align:middle line:84%
what normal birth is anymore
because they never see it.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.910 align:middle line:90%
Nurses don't know what it is.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And even the midwives
barely know what it is.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.470 align:middle line:84%
They're trained
in it, in theory,

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
but they hardly
ever get to see it.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
If you do want a normal
birth in a US hospital,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
your best bet is with
a US nurse midwife--

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
because they at least try
to maintain some semblance

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:90%
of normality in birth.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And they try to understand the
normal physiology of birth.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Doctors really have no education
in the normal physiology

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle line:84%
of birth because they
never see normal birth,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:90%
nor do they have a value on it.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
They think that
mechanizing birth and doing

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of cesareans
is safer and better.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:90%
That's how they're trained.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, as they
get trained more and more

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.330 align:middle line:84%
in cesareans, they're being
de-skilled in other areas.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.670 align:middle line:84%
American obstetricians
no longer know

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.670 align:middle line:84%
how to assist a breech
birth vaginally; or how

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:84%
to use a vacuum extraction,
barely; or how to use forceps--

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.270 align:middle line:84%
which can be very useful at
times to avoid cesareans.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But now instead of going
for the vacuum extraction

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.578 align:middle line:84%
or the forceps
delivery, if you have

00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:84%
a lot of skill with
forceps, you tend

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
not to do much harm
with those forceps.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.950 align:middle line:84%
But doctors aren't even
bothering with the forceps

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.750 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:84%
They just go straight
to the cesarean.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So of course we're now at a 34%
cesarean rate in my country.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And we have hospitals with
50% and 60% cesarean rates.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Which, 10 years ago,
I would have said,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
ever gonna get there.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
We had such a strong
activist birth movement

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And we did such a good job
in the '80s and '90s of--

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:84%
the '70s, '80s, and early
'90s of recovering VBAC.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Because, back in
the '50s and '60s,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.675 align:middle line:84%
the rule was, once a
cesarean, always a cesarean.

00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:25.442 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't that
bad in those days.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Because, in 1970 in the US, we
had only a 6% cesarean rate.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:84%
So once a cesarean,
always a cesarean

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.220 align:middle line:90%
was bad for that 6% of women.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
But most women
didn't have cesareans

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.730 align:middle line:90%
so it wasn't that big a deal.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1985 Nancy Wainer
Cohen published "Silent Knife,"

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.950 align:middle line:84%
which was the voices
of those 6% of women

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:90%
who were having cesareans.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And then by 1985, it was
higher than that already.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.750 align:middle line:90%
By then, it was 23% or 24%.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And so once Nancy Wainer
published that book,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and we had a name for it, VBAC,
vaginal birth after cesarean,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
that book was the catalyst
for a wave of birth activism

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.570 align:middle line:84%
around restoring vaginal
birth after cesarean--

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.210 align:middle line:84%
or getting rid of the once a
cesarean, always a cesarean

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:90%
rule.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
By then it'd become really
important to try to do that.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Because, as I said before, in
1970 in the US, or cesarean

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.020 align:middle line:90%
rate was 6%.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.740 align:middle line:84%
By 1980, the cesarean
rate was 23%.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It jumped that much in
one decade, 6% to 23%.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Primarily, I believe,
because of the introduction

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.310 align:middle line:84%
of the electronic fetal monitor
into American hospitals.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
The monitor was invented in
1970 by an American physician,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.790 align:middle line:84%
an obstetrician named
Edward Hon, H-O-N.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.268 align:middle line:84%
He invented it because he
thought if he could show--

00:05:45.268 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
if he could find a
machine that would

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.400 align:middle line:84%
show that the baby's
heart was fine

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and the mother's
contractions were strong,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that he could prevent
interventions in labor--

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.145 align:middle line:84%
because the machine would show
good process most of the time.

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:00.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, once the machine got
introduced into every hospital

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:84%
birth, it had exactly
the opposite effect.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Too much information
is provided by

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
the electronic fetal
monitor, or over here you

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:90%
might call it the CTG.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
It records every sign of every
fetal heart rate deceleration

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
and every contraction
of the mothers.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
And because babies'
hearts naturally

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
decelerate during
labor, especially

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.760 align:middle line:84%
during strong contractions,
if you don't know that,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
if you don't see
every one, you're

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:90%
less likely to get alarmed.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have four
decades of evidence

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.590 align:middle line:84%
now that nurses or
midwives, or even doctors,

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.620 align:middle line:84%
auscultating with the
stethoscope or the fetus scope

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.620 align:middle line:90%
to hear the fetal heartbeat.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.260 align:middle line:84%
And note that every 20
minutes is much more effective

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
than having the
mother continuously

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
on the electronic monitor in
terms of improving outcomes.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.670 align:middle line:84%
We have four decades
of evidence that

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
show us that being
on the monitor

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
does not improve
outcomes in any way.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:84%
All it does is raise
the cesarean rate.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.090 align:middle line:90%
Why does it do that?

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
Because if you see
every deceleration,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.140 align:middle line:90%
you start to freak out.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And you go, oh, my god,
the baby's in distress.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And you rush off for a
cesarean that wasn't necessary.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:84%
And you deliver, by an
unnecessary cesarean,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.320 align:middle line:84%
a baby with an Apgar of 10
because the baby was fine

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.282 align:middle line:90%
all along.

00:07:10.282 --> 00:07:12.490 align:middle line:84%
That's what birth is like
in the United States today.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's been-- the
electronic fetal monitor

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.590 align:middle line:90%
has been massively misused.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:90%
It can be used--

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.550 align:middle line:84%
you know, a 20-minute
strip every now

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.287 align:middle line:90%
and then is not a bad idea.

00:07:26.287 --> 00:07:27.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just when you
put the woman on it

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.690 align:middle line:84%
continuously, first of all,
that imprisons her in one place.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the essence of
birth is movement.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.830 align:middle line:84%
To give birth
successfully, to help

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate the normal
physiological process of birth,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
the woman must be, number
one, eating and drinking

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:90%
to keep her strength up.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.220 align:middle line:84%
We have so many
cesareans in the US

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.220 align:middle line:84%
because women are too
hungry and too tired and too

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.660 align:middle line:84%
thirsty to be able to go on,
especially if their labor goes

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.200 align:middle line:90%
for more than 12 or 15 hours.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.350 align:middle line:84%
You get exhausted
and you're starving.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.060 align:middle line:84%
So eating and
drinking, number one.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:84%
The second most
important ingredient

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:84%
for a successful normal
physiological birth

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:90%
is movement.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:90%
Women need to be up and moving.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:84%
On a birth ball rocking
their pelvis back and forth.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.070 align:middle line:90%
Walking around.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully there's a garden
outdoors or someplace

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.670 align:middle line:84%
where they can walk
in, which is not

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.905 align:middle line:84%
possible in most
hospitals, but ought to be.

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:84%
In New Zealand, they have these
marvelous small maternity units

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.447 align:middle line:84%
and birth centers with
lovely outdoor gardens,

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:21.600 align:middle line:84%
where women can go
be during labor.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.120 align:middle line:84%
If you stay home in labor,
you can bake a chocolate cake

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:84%
or you can clean your
house a little bit.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, you need to
be moving constantly.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.513 align:middle line:84%
So what are the two
things you don't get

00:08:30.513 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:90%
to do in American hospitals?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't get to eat or drink--
maybe drink a little bit,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.252 align:middle line:90%
but you don't get to eat.

00:08:35.252 --> 00:08:37.169 align:middle line:84%
In some places, yes,
they've allowed that now.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:90%
But in most places, no.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.110 align:middle line:90%
And you don't get to move.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You get to be trapped
in the bed, imprisoned

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:43.140 align:middle line:90%
by the fetal monitor.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
If you have an epidural,
even less chance of moving.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
If you have an
epidural, you have

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.160 align:middle line:84%
to have the monitor on because
the epidural itself can

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.420 align:middle line:90%
slow labor and cause problems.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you go
for the pain relief,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
you go for the monitor
and all that that entails.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.160 align:middle line:90%
So you're trapped.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Although, I have to say, it's
important to understand--

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I think nurses, and midwives
especially-- obstetricians

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.622 align:middle line:84%
are not in the labor
room with the mother.

00:09:08.622 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
They're not there
most of the time.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They come in, do a check,
and they live again.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And then they come
in to catch the baby.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the nurses and the
midwives that are there.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.765 align:middle line:84%
In my country, it's
mostly the nurses,

00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:84%
because we only have
midwives attending

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.170 align:middle line:90%
8% of American births.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:84%
In Australia, it's much more
midwives and much less nurses.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.180 align:middle line:84%
But creative nurses and creative
midwives, in both countries,

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to realize that
she may be on the monitor

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.070 align:middle line:90%
and she may have an epidural--

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
but if she wants a physiological
birth, as much as possible

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.150 align:middle line:84%
given the circumstances,
we can get her up

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.400 align:middle line:90%
and put her on the birth ball.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
She can be on the birth
ball right next to the bed,

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.510 align:middle line:84%
still with all the tethers in
the IV line and everything.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.550 align:middle line:84%
But you can rock your
pelvis on a birth ball,

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.620 align:middle line:84%
even with all the
technology attached.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.852 align:middle line:84%
Or you can put the
birth bed upright.

00:09:54.852 --> 00:09:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And the mother can turn
around on her hands and knees

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and drape her hands and her
arms over the top of the bed

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.030 align:middle line:84%
and lean forward into the bed
and rock her pelvis that way.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Anything to keep moving is
going to greatly enhance

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
her chances of a normal birth.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.920 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.990 align:middle line:84%
American obstetricians
get paid--

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:84%
OK, American hospitals charge
around $20,000 to $30,000

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.210 align:middle line:90%
for a cesarean section.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:84%
The cost of a normal birth is
more like $8,000 to $10,000.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.733 align:middle line:84%
In other words, when I say,
normal, I have to qualify that.

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Because in the US we
really don't have--

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:90%
I have to repeat.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:84%
We do not have normal
physiological birth

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.490 align:middle line:84%
hardly at all in my country--
maybe 3% to 4% of births.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:84%
If you take 3% of
normal hospital births

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and 1% of home births
and birth center births,

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.530 align:middle line:84%
you get 4% of all births
in my country are normal.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:84%
So when I say, normal, what
I really mean is vaginal.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:84%
You can have a vaginal
birth in the US

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.190 align:middle line:84%
for around $8,000 or $10,000
in the hospital and, again,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.090 align:middle line:84%
a cesarean for
$20,000 to $30,000.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So obstetricians, of course,
don't take away all that money

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:90%
for themselves.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But they do make around three to
four times more for a cesarean

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:84%
than they do for a
vaginal delivery.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So of course-- and it's not
just that they make more

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:90%
for the cesarean.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It's that it takes
them so much less time.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.330 align:middle line:84%
You can have that baby out
and have the mother sewed up

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
in 20 minutes.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But if it's a vaginal birth, you
have to be coming in and out,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:84%
checking on her, waiting
around in the hospital for her

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
to give birth.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.712 align:middle line:84%
Would you please get
this show on the road?

00:11:21.712 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:84%
Let's hurry up
and move it along.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.432 align:middle line:84%
So obstetricians have every
reason to do cesareans.

00:11:26.432 --> 00:11:28.890 align:middle line:84%
One, they're de-skilled and
they don't know what else to do

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.308 align:middle line:90%
for any complication--

00:11:31.308 --> 00:11:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that normally they would have
had to use vacuum forceps

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.837 align:middle line:84%
or do an external version
or catch a breech baby.

00:11:35.837 --> 00:11:37.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't know how
to do any of that.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.300 align:middle line:84%
So they just jump
to the cesarean.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's one, they
don't know better.

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Or they don't know how to do it
otherwise because they're not

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:90%
taught anymore.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And number two, time,
it saves so much time.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:90%
Convenience, power.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.700 align:middle line:84%
When an obstetrician
performs a cesarean,

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.580 align:middle line:84%
he or she feels the power
of life in their hands.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:84%
They deliver the
baby, quite literally.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.740 align:middle line:84%
They cut the mother
open, and they reach in

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and they pull the baby out.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.467 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed
so many of them

00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and they get this little
spark in their eyes

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.270 align:middle line:84%
when they talk about how cool
it is to pull a baby up out

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.090 align:middle line:84%
of the womb and know that
you delivered that baby.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.950 align:middle line:90%
You brought it into the world.

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
You hopefully saved its life,
although most cesareans are not

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.620 align:middle line:84%
life-saving,
they're unnecessary.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.130 align:middle line:84%
WHO says we should not have a
cesarean rate higher than 15%.

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And now they're,
like, 15% to 20%.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.980 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have to say,
we all in the birth world

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
used to think that any Cesarean
rate above 15% was terrible.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.808 align:middle line:84%
Now we think any cesarean rate
below 25% is great, you know,

00:12:38.808 --> 00:12:41.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's gotten so much
higher in so many countries

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.900 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.760 align:middle line:84%
So you know if you're
hanging out around 22%,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.430 align:middle line:84%
like the UK is,
that they're trying.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Scandinavian countries
have cesarean rates

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:90%
in the high teens or low 20s.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
That means they're trying really
hard not to let it go higher.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Once you get your
cesarean rate about 25%,

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.090 align:middle line:84%
it becomes completely
tautological and you cannot--

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
it's almost impossible to
bring it back down again.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Because, you've
lost VBAC already.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:84%
We've pretty much
completely lost VBACS

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
in my country
because of a series

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.090 align:middle line:84%
of most-unfortunate events that
happened in the early 2000s.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:13.890 align:middle line:90%
So no VBACS.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.743 align:middle line:84%
Doctors don't know
how to do breeches.

00:13:15.743 --> 00:13:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
jumped to cesarean

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:90%
for every little thing.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So you get those
three factors in play,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and you get this escalating
rise in cesareans.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a cesarean
for the first kid,

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.140 align:middle line:84%
now it's gonna be for
the second kid as well.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.112 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
34% cesarean rate.

00:13:30.112 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So more and more primates
are having cesareans,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.220 align:middle line:84%
meaning more and more multips
are gonna have cesareans.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, plus
doctors not knowing

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
how to do anything else, it
just escalates from there.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes almost impossible
to stop it and bring it

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.140 align:middle line:90%
back down.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So it's key for
any country who's

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
got a cesarean rate
under 25% to work

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:90%
very hard to keep it there.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we kept our
cesarean rate in the US

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
at under 25% from 1980
until 2004, approximately.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.250 align:middle line:84%
And that had a lot to
do with the huge effort

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.880 align:middle line:84%
that childbirth activists put
into yelling and screaming

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.430 align:middle line:84%
at any percentage point
rise in the cesarean.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:13.600 align:middle line:84%
So it'd go up to 24%, and
then we'd yell and scream,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:90%
and it'd go back down to 21%.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And it went like that
all through the '90s,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:90%
but it never got above 25%.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd yell and scream
and it would go back down.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So we literally maintained it
that low for that long a time.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And then in around 2005, this
study was published showing--

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
well, ACOG, the American
College of OBGYN

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.840 align:middle line:84%
came out with a statement
saying that they

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
thought that elective
cesareans were ethical.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.658 align:middle line:84%
So it was OK to do
cesareans for women

00:14:41.658 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:84%
who just wanted
them, and didn't want

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.075 align:middle line:84%
to have to go through
labor because they just

00:14:45.075 --> 00:14:46.830 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.988 align:middle line:90%
So that happened.

00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:49.530 align:middle line:84%
And then a couple
of studies came out

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.320 align:middle line:90%
that got very misinterpreted.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And then a study
came out about--

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.710 align:middle line:84%
it was saying that there
was a much greater risk

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:90%
of uterine rupture with VBAC.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was a very
unfortunate study.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:05.310 align:middle line:84%
That was Mona
Lydon-Rochelle's study.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And what her study
actually showed--

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:90%
and this was around 2005.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.020 align:middle line:84%
What her study actually showed
was that the more Pitocin

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
you use during a
VBAC, the greater

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.590 align:middle line:90%
your chance of uterine rupture.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So the logical
conclusion would be,

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.180 align:middle line:90%
don't use Pitocin with a VBAC.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
Hello?

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.680 align:middle line:84%
But doctors in my country
are so used to using Pitocin,

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:84%
they literally do not know how
to do births without inducing

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and augmenting with Pitocin.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So they couldn't
imagine not doing births

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:84%
with Pitocin, because to them,
birth equals Pitocin induction

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and augmentation.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:84%
So the conclusion
that they reached

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.110 align:middle line:84%
was, don't do VBACs
anymore, except in

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.030 align:middle line:84%
high-level tertiary
care hospitals

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:48.240 align:middle line:84%
with 24/7
anesthesiology on call.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.670 align:middle line:84%
Because of course we're gonna
use Pitocin, so of course

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.940 align:middle line:84%
the risk of uterine
rupture is gonna be higher.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.090 align:middle line:90%
So that's why we started.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
That's really--
those two things,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.400 align:middle line:84%
the ACOG statement saying that
it was ethical to do elective

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:84%
cesareans, the Mona
Lydon-Rochelle study,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.970 align:middle line:84%
which doctors interpreted to
mean you should never do--

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.920 align:middle line:84%
that VBACs lead to higher
risk of uterine rupture.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.170 align:middle line:90%
And there was one other thing.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and the loss of
breech deliveries,

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:20.580 align:middle line:90%
the high fear of breech.

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:90%
All of those things just--

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.620 align:middle line:84%
from then on, the cesarean rate
from 24% up to the current 34%.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's rising at a
percentage point a year.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.210 align:middle line:84%
So, unlikely that we'll
be able to bring it

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.650 align:middle line:84%
back down, unless somebody
figures out that-- gee-whiz,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
we could do VBACs
without Pitocin.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:38.480 align:middle line:90%
They'd be a whole lot safer.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody would
figure that out,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:84%
then we might be able to
start bringing it down again.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.040 align:middle line:84%
With the breech issue,
there are researchers

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.795 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
in Europe especially,

00:16:48.795 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and in other places, who are
working very hard on bringing

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.160 align:middle line:90%
back vaginal breech.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.410 align:middle line:84%
Because now we have some
large-scale trials showing

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.400 align:middle line:90%
that, in fact--

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.140 align:middle line:84%
with skilled hands,
in skilled care,

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
with people who know
how to attend to breech,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
vaginal breech can be a very
successful and safe mode

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:90%
of delivery.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's scary
for practitioners.

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.180 align:middle line:90%
But you have to know what to do.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.418 align:middle line:84%
You have to know how to let
the baby's butt come out.

00:17:10.418 --> 00:17:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to know how
to put your fingers in and pull

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
the neck down like this
or flex the head here.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.849 align:middle line:84%
You have to keep
the head like that.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's only 3% of deliveries.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But 3% of millions of
births is a lot of births.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.069 align:middle line:84%
So there are some
practitioners that

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
are trying to teach others to
help them re-skill themselves

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:90%
in vaginal breech.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So there's a slight movement
toward that around the world.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's not impossible to
bring cesarean rates down.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But again, you'd
have to have people

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84%
who are losing their fear
of birth and developing

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:84%
confidence, and people
who truly understand

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.940 align:middle line:90%
the scientific evidence.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.240 align:middle line:84%
If a study shows that
rates of uterine rupture

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.730 align:middle line:84%
are higher when you
use Pitocin in a VBAC,

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
then make the logical
conclusion and don't

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:90%
use Pitocin for a VBAC.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Try patience instead.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed in recent
years, it seems to me anyway,

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.070 align:middle line:84%
women used to be afraid of
cesareans back in my day.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And now women are often
afraid of vaginal birth,

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.200 align:middle line:90%
more so than of cesareans.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.270 align:middle line:84%
Because so many people
are having cesareans,

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.020 align:middle line:84%
and the baby's fine
and the mother's fine,

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.520 align:middle line:84%
and they note that they didn't
have to go through labor pain

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:90%
if it's a scheduled cesarean.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And as you see movie stars
doing that more and more,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.460 align:middle line:84%
then it begins to
appear to be normative.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to think,
well, why should I

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
go through all that
mess and that fuss

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.010 align:middle line:84%
and that bother
and all the pain.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, why bother
even with an epidural?

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.880 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I just
schedule my cesarean?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So we do see an uptick
in elective cesareans

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.440 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:84%
In developed countries--
not around the world,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:90%
just in developed countries.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.790 align:middle line:84%
We also see, in the US,
an uptick in home births.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:90%
It's very interesting.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:84%
I got a lot of calls to
be interviewed last month

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.270 align:middle line:84%
in the US because the
home birth rate doubled.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.610 align:middle line:90%
It went from-- no, sorry.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:90%
The home birth rate rose by 20%.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.462 align:middle line:90%
It went from .06% to point .08%.

00:19:01.462 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
But that was apparently
a big enough deal

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
to generate some media
publicity around it.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.750 align:middle line:84%
So I got all these questions
about why American women are

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
choosing home birth, and
which, precisely, women are.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, inevitably
in every country

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I visit, when women
actively choose

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.830 align:middle line:84%
home birth in a
developed country,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.160 align:middle line:84%
it is because they are
informed and educated

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and they understand that
home birth will give them

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.040 align:middle line:84%
the best chance of a safe normal
physiological birth-- home

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
birth with a skilled assistant;
especially planned home

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:32.640 align:middle line:90%
birth with a midwife.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So those choices are
informed and educated.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think the media
in the US pay attention

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:84%
because it is this cohort
of highly educated, middle

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and upper class
white women that are

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.890 align:middle line:90%
choosing to give birth at home.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And they are all the more
reinforced in those choices

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.810 align:middle line:84%
when they see that the
cesarean rate in the US

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.390 align:middle line:84%
has gone up to 34%,
and they realize

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that they have
over a one in three

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.740 align:middle line:84%
chance of having cesarean
if they go to the hospital.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:84%
So they increasingly
are choosing

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.000 align:middle line:84%
to stay home so that
they can be safe

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.910 align:middle line:84%
and protected from the
interventions of the hospital.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Which is so ironic because it
is those hospital interventions

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.920 align:middle line:84%
that were supposed
to be lifesaving,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that were supposed
to keep women safe.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And now women are
saying, no, it's

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:90%
more dangerous in the hospital.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.388 align:middle line:84%
Look what they're
doing to people.

00:20:16.388 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm staying home
because that's where

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:90%
I'll be safe and protected.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.120 align:middle line:90%


00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
There's a spectrum
of choice in birth.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
And that spectrum extends
from unassisted, birth at home

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.990 align:middle line:90%
or free birth--

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.530 align:middle line:90%
without any attendants around.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Then the spectrum
of choice moves

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:39.080 align:middle line:84%
from those unassisted births to
a planned midwife-attended home

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.340 align:middle line:84%
birth; to a birth center
birth; to a hospital

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
birth with a midwife in a
small community hospital;

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.960 align:middle line:84%
to birth in larger tertiary
care centers with midwives

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:84%
and obstetricians in
attendance; and then

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.840 align:middle line:84%
all the way to the scheduled
elective cesareans.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.280 align:middle line:90%
That is the spectrum of choice.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
When you're planning a birth
you have, ideally open to you,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.000 align:middle line:90%
that full spectrum of choice.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
If we lost home
birth, the spectrum

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.310 align:middle line:84%
would narrow to choice of
birth center, small hospital

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:16.460 align:middle line:84%
or large hospital,
or elective cesarean.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we lost birth centers,
it would narrow even further.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And all the knowledge
about vaginal breeches

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and external versions and how
to deal with shoulder dystocias

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:84%
without resorting to
cesareans-- all that knowledge

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:90%
would be lost.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Because only those
people who operate

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
on this side of the spectrum
are preserving those skills

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.860 align:middle line:84%
that on this side of
the spectrum people

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.140 align:middle line:90%
are losing or have already lost.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So it is essential for
the health and well-being

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
of the maternity care
system in any society

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:90%
to keep the full spectrum open.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:90%
It is absolutely essential.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, I honor women's
right to choose along

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.260 align:middle line:90%
that full spectrum.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But I deeply question
the cultural influences

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
that mold and shape women's
choices, which are primarily

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.690 align:middle line:90%
for this end of the spectrum.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
We are raised in
a culture of fear.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.900 align:middle line:84%
We fear nature in general
because we live so far removed

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.860 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:84%
We fear birth as a
chaotic natural process.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.255 align:middle line:84%
We fear pain, because we're
raised to be so comfortable all

00:22:13.255 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
the time, to adjust the
air conditioning if it gets

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:90%
a little hot or a little cold.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.990 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to be uncomfortable.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So why go through
pain and birth?

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
So all of our cultural
conditioning shape

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:25.370 align:middle line:84%
moves us away from this
part of the spectrum, which

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
is why it's so culturally
marginal and so much less

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.370 align:middle line:84%
percentage-wise than this
part, and toward this highly

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:90%
technocratic approach to birth.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you're choosing
this approach,

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.695 align:middle line:84%
if you're choosing a
scheduled cesarean,

00:22:39.695 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I would never question
your right to do that.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But I would ask, is your
choice truly informed

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:84%
or is it simply culturally
shaped and molded?

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.990 align:middle line:84%
It is common for countries
with good mortality rates,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.280 align:middle line:90%
like Australia, to say--

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.780 align:middle line:84%
well, our mortality
rates are great.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.788 align:middle line:90%
So what's the problem?

00:22:59.788 --> 00:23:01.080 align:middle line:90%
What are you complaining about?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in Australia, you
have a 33% cesarean rate.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But our perinatal mortality
rate is 10 per 1,000.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's really--
that's higher

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
than it really is because
you guys are taking

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.940 align:middle line:84%
perinatal mortality over
here from 20 weeks, which

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
includes planned abortions
and miscarriages.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's really not
fair to yourselves.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Most countries take perinatal
mortality from 28 weeks.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have a perinatal
mortality rate of 10 per 1,000

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:84%
from 20 weeks, if you
move it to 28 weeks

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.140 align:middle line:90%
it's gonna be way lower.

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.640 align:middle line:90%
So yes, your outcomes are great.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:84%
And your maternal mortality
rates are really low.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
In the US, maternal
mortality has

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:90%
doubled in the last 10 years.

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:48.150 align:middle line:84%
It went from 8 per
100,000 to 17 per 100,000,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.920 align:middle line:84%
because of excessive
interventions,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
because women are
dying from infections.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But here in Australia, you're
doing good with mortality.

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:57.610 align:middle line:90%
So what's the problem?

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.640 align:middle line:84%
The problem is not
mortality over here,

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.480 align:middle line:84%
it's morbidity and
quality of experience.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.440 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:06.673 align:middle line:84%
Just because you save
mothers and babies

00:24:06.673 --> 00:24:09.090 align:middle line:84%
and they're not dying, doesn't
mean their birth experience

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.590 align:middle line:90%
was OK with them.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.660 align:middle line:84%
If a woman really
wants a normal birth,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and she ends up with an
unnecessary cesarean,

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.817 align:middle line:84%
or with a highly interventionist
medical birth against her will;

00:24:18.817 --> 00:24:21.150 align:middle line:84%
if she ends up being put on
Pitocin when she didn't want

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:24.030 align:middle line:84%
to, for example, and having
a much more painful labor

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.520 align:middle line:84%
as a result, she is
going to feel traumatized

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.380 align:middle line:84%
at the end of her
birth experience.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.210 align:middle line:84%
Traumatized mothers,
of whom there

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.700 align:middle line:84%
are many running around
Australia and the US

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.220 align:middle line:84%
these days, have a much
more difficult time

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:90%
taking care of their children.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.340 align:middle line:84%
They have more
difficulty breastfeeding.

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:84%
They may have more trouble
with postnatal depression.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.990 align:middle line:84%
They have more trouble with
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:84%
It makes their family
lives much more difficult.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not OK just to
say, oh, it's all good

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.020 align:middle line:90%
because they're alive.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.920 align:middle line:84%
What is their quality
of life is the question

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.837 align:middle line:90%
you need to be asking.

00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:57.480 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Around this issue
of quality of care,

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to low
mortality rates,

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:90%
we could look at New Zealand.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.530 align:middle line:84%
New Zealand also has
very low mortality rates.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:84%
It's perinatal mortality rate
is the same as Australia's.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.710 align:middle line:84%
But quality of care is a big
deal for New Zealand mothers

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:90%
and midwives.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:84%
So they have excellent
outcomes just like you

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.550 align:middle line:90%
do in terms of mortality.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.960 align:middle line:84%
But they have a better
quality of care,

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.690 align:middle line:84%
so they have happier
mothers and happier babies.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The maternity care system in
New Zealand, in my opinion,

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:90%
is the best in the world.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
I used to think the
Netherlands was the best,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
and now I would
rate it number two,

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.990 align:middle line:84%
but New Zealand I
would rate number one.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.450 align:middle line:84%
Because, first of all,
100% of New Zealand births

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.920 align:middle line:90%
are attended by midwives.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Second of all a, mother
has her full choice

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.170 align:middle line:90%
to pick a lead maternity care.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.370 align:middle line:90%
They call it LMC.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And that can be a midwife,
it can be an obstetrician,

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:52.740 align:middle line:90%
or it can be a GP.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.985 align:middle line:84%
Well, when the midwives
set this up in the 1990s,

00:25:56.985 --> 00:25:58.860 align:middle line:84%
obstetricians went along
with it because they

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.620 align:middle line:84%
thought the lead maternity
care would be them.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Ironically enough, 80%
of New Zealand women

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:84%
pick a midwife to be their
lead maternity carer.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, New Zealand
midwives are all

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.040 align:middle line:84%
about normal
physiological birth.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:84%
It's the model that
they're taught.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.802 align:middle line:84%
And all their skills
in school and what

00:26:14.802 --> 00:26:16.260 align:middle line:84%
they learn in
midwifery training is

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
how to facilitate normal
physiological birth.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.750 align:middle line:84%
Many of them do get
out-of-hospital experience.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Many of the student trainees do
see normal physiological birth,

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.570 align:middle line:84%
a lot more than they do
in most other countries.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.130 align:middle line:84%
In the US, like I
said, you hardly

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.668 align:middle line:84%
ever see a normal physiological
birth in a hospital.

00:26:31.668 --> 00:26:33.210 align:middle line:84%
But in New Zealand
hospitals, there's

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:90%
a lot of normal birth going on.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And in New Zealand
homes and birth centers

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.210 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of
normal birth going on.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Also, New Zealand has these
things called maternity units.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:44.880 align:middle line:84%
They're little
community hospitals

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
that specialize
in birth out there

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.380 align:middle line:84%
in the boonies and
various rural areas.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And they're charming and cozy.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.350 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they were
built 50, 60 years ago,

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
so they had that
slightly funky feel.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:58.260 align:middle line:84%
But they'll have two
or three birth rooms.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And so women can stay in their
communities to give birth.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So home birth in New
Zealand is around 8%.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.870 align:middle line:84%
It would be higher,
except that women

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.300 align:middle line:84%
love these small
rural maternity units.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And they know that if
they don't utilize them

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.200 align:middle line:90%
they will be closed.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Plus, New Zealand
has a whole rash

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:84%
of new shiny, lovely,
urban birth centers--

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
that I got the good
fortune to visit--

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.880 align:middle line:84%
that have the tubs and
the ropes to pull on

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.587 align:middle line:84%
and the sling to hang
yourself in from the ceiling

00:27:26.587 --> 00:27:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and spin around, so you can
rock your pelvis really well

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.970 align:middle line:90%
during birth.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And every maternity
facility in New Zealand

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:90%
has two kinds of midwives.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.430 align:middle line:84%
There's core midwives,
who stay in the facility--

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the small maternity
unit or the urban birth

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.290 align:middle line:90%
center or the hospital.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a core midwife,
who's on shift there

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.910 align:middle line:90%
and is always there--

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:90%
according to her shift.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.780 align:middle line:84%
And then there are caseload
midwives in New Zealand.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And the caseload midwives
take on clients one to one.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there will
be three midwives

00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.250 align:middle line:90%
in a caseload practice.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And they'll take on a
certain number of women

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.340 align:middle line:90%
per year, maybe 40, maybe 50.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
New Zealand midwives have
full freedom of choice

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.343 align:middle line:84%
in what their
caseload is according

00:28:07.343 --> 00:28:08.760 align:middle line:84%
to their level of
ability to work,

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
their family responsibilities,
et cetera-- all government

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:90%
funded.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So the caseload midwife
promises the client

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
that out of the three midwives
in that caseload practice,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.570 align:middle line:84%
all of her 40 clients through
that year, all of them

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.360 align:middle line:84%
will be with at least
one of those three

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.160 align:middle line:84%
all the way through labor and
birth and will not be left.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.930 align:middle line:84%
So if the birth starts at
home or in a maternity unit

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.570 align:middle line:84%
or in a birth center, the
caseload midwife is there.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's a transfer
to a hospital,

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.462 align:middle line:84%
the caseload midwives goes
there and stays with the mother

00:28:38.462 --> 00:28:40.170 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
the birth, working in

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.930 align:middle line:84%
tandem and collaboration
with the core midwife

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.062 align:middle line:84%
and with the obstetricians
if necessary.

00:28:45.062 --> 00:28:47.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a vast improvement
over the Dutch system, where

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.760 align:middle line:84%
if the mother needs to
transport from home to hospital,

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.310 align:middle line:84%
the midwife will drop
her off at the hospital,

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.870 align:middle line:90%
tuck her in and leave.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, not stay with her,
because the midwives' caseloads

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.800 align:middle line:90%
in the Netherlands are too high.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:01.470 align:middle line:84%
They have to do over
100 a year, which

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.610 align:middle line:84%
is unreasonable to
require of any midwife.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So they'll dump off the
mother at the hospital

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and go rushing off to do
their prenatals and postnatals

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.570 align:middle line:90%
that they have to do.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.372 align:middle line:84%
In Australia, if a home birth
midwife starts out with you,

00:29:14.372 --> 00:29:16.830 align:middle line:84%
and you go to the hospital,
often she will leave you there.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.205 align:middle line:84%
She might have to
leave you there

00:29:18.205 --> 00:29:20.250 align:middle line:84%
because she won't be
welcomed into the hospital.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:84%
She might want to go with you,
but she won't be welcomed.

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So New Zealand has it all over
Australia and the Netherlands

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.080 align:middle line:84%
in terms of quality of
care and continuity of care

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and of carer.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It's really interesting
to ask ourselves

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:84%
why women tolerate the
often abusive treatment

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.260 align:middle line:84%
that they receive in hospitals,
if not overtly abusive,

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.320 align:middle line:90%
at least disrespectful.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And if not disrespectful,
at least supercilious

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.910 align:middle line:90%
in a way, arrogant.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.100 align:middle line:84%
Obstetricians are
likely to just dismiss

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.390 align:middle line:84%
a woman's wants and needs
and feelings and say, well,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.000 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be this way.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And why do women
put up with that?

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:07.000 align:middle line:84%
I have interviewed a lot of
women about exactly that.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And I also, at this recent
Australian home birth

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:84%
conference that I just
attended, there were women--

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.030 align:middle line:84%
there were several
panels of women telling

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.382 align:middle line:90%
their experiences of HBAC--

00:30:17.382 --> 00:30:19.090 align:middle line:84%
what they're calling
HBAC back over here,

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:90%
home birth after cesarean.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And it amazed me
how these women, who

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:28.300 align:middle line:84%
had had terrible
hospital experiences,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.490 align:middle line:84%
it took them two
cesarean sometimes

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to decide to leave the hospital
and go home to give birth

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:36.110 align:middle line:90%
under their own power.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:84%
It took them many
experiences of doctors

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.490 align:middle line:84%
being negative or arrogant
or discounting their wishes

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.453 align:middle line:84%
before they'd finally decide,
two weeks before they were due,

00:30:45.453 --> 00:30:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that they couldn't
take it anymore

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.230 align:middle line:84%
and they just had to get out of
there and give birth at home.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.110 align:middle line:84%
How much do women have to go
through before they finally

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.930 align:middle line:84%
vote with their feet and go
decide to opt-out of the system

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.920 align:middle line:90%
altogether?

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lot.

00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.980 align:middle line:90%
Women have a lot of tolerance.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
They may get upset by
their medical treatment,

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:84%
but they tolerate it
and they accept it

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.850 align:middle line:84%
because they are scared not
to give birth in the hospital.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.170 align:middle line:90%
It's all about fear.

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.940 align:middle line:84%
You put up with a lot
from practitioners

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.490 align:middle line:84%
you might not even
like that much,

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
just so that you'll feel safe
giving birth in a hospital.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.570 align:middle line:84%
And you think, well, I won't
die and my baby won't die.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Even if I don't like
the doctor, even

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:90%
if the midwife is mean to me--

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.590 align:middle line:84%
whatever it takes, because
I have to protect my baby

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and I have to
protect my own life.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it
takes women so long.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And when they're finally
pushed beyond their limits

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.160 align:middle line:84%
to simply not be able to
take that negative treatment

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:84%
anymore, and then they
look at home birth

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.290 align:middle line:90%
and then they start to--

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:38.040 align:middle line:84%
that's when they start
to do the research.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.690 align:middle line:84%
They start to ask, would it
be possible and how dangerous

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.970 align:middle line:84%
is it if I put my
own feelings first

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and choose to give
birth at home?

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And then they do the
research and they

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.368 align:middle line:84%
realize that home
birth is actually

00:31:47.368 --> 00:31:49.090 align:middle line:90%
safer than hospital birth.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And they get very
excited because now it's

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.233 align:middle line:90%
not about being selfish.

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It's about making the right
and the informed choice.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:90%


00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.650 align:middle line:84%
To transform birth
in any society,

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.680 align:middle line:84%
the first thing is
education of women

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and the entire populace in
normal physiological birth,

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.760 align:middle line:84%
and in the notion that birth
is a normal life event.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Young girls have to-- and young
boys, need to be told that

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and believe that and get
that from a very early age

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.290 align:middle line:90%
before they can get scared.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.620 align:middle line:84%
Number two, and the quickest and
first and foremost thing to do,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.930 align:middle line:84%
is to change the
education of OBGYNs.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:84%
They need to be trained in
normal physiological birth.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.990 align:middle line:84%
And they need to be taught
that midwives are the guise

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.620 align:middle line:90%
and guardians of normal birth.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.590 align:middle line:90%
OBs need to know how to do it.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And they need to know how to
perform the skills that they

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.140 align:middle line:84%
might need to perform-- like a
vacuum extraction to keep birth

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.820 align:middle line:90%
physiological and not--

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.670 align:middle line:90%
or vaginal and not a cesarean.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.550 align:middle line:84%
But they also need to understand
that their role should

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:47.040 align:middle line:84%
be limited to backup
for the midwives.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Midwives should be
doing 70% to 80%

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.540 align:middle line:90%
of the births in most countries.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And OBs should be
doing 20%, around.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:84%
Because they should be there
when their skills are truly

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.440 align:middle line:84%
needed for truly pathological
occurrences, or truly high-risk

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.430 align:middle line:84%
They should not have their
hands into normal birth.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:84%
If, with their current
desire to seduce cesareans,

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.800 align:middle line:84%
they would confine
themselves to the few cases

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.140 align:middle line:84%
where it's really
necessary to do a cesarean,

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:90%
we wouldn't have a problem.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.660 align:middle line:84%
It's because OBs are in
there attending women

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.910 align:middle line:90%
they shouldn't even be around.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Because they're not
needed for those women.
