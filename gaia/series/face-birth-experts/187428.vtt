00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'm Rhea Dempsey, and I
am a child birth educator

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.250 align:middle line:84%
and a birth attendant,
or more commonly called

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.790 align:middle line:84%
a doula these days,
and also a counselor,

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and work particularly
with birthing issues.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And I call my work
birthing wisdom.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So that's a sort
of an overall name

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.033 align:middle line:84%
of the various
aspects of work that I

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
do that relate
particularly to birthing.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.957 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:28.040 align:middle line:84%
There are probably quite
a lot of women, you know,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe 30, 40, 50% of women who
still deep within themselves--

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.130 align:middle line:84%
or even not so deep,
but have a yearning

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
to want to honor their bodies
and that birthing process.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Some of them, of course, have
taken the cultural message,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.520 align:middle line:84%
which is a very strongly
acculturated fear

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.888 align:middle line:90%
message about birth.

00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And so they might
have that yearning,

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
but not really seek to act on
it, because they're trading off

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.450 align:middle line:90%
against the fear.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.400 align:middle line:84%
So the percentage of women who
are prepared to act on that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.500 align:middle line:84%
and really seek the
information that they need

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and make the choices
to give themselves

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
a chance is probably smaller
than that, you know, 40, 50%--

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:84%
probably more like--
I don't know, 10%,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:90%
or could be even less.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But if we had a
different birth culture

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:84%
where the options that
could support women's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:84%
birthing capacity, if they
were more readily known,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
or just really a more
general part of the range

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities, then I'm
sure that many, many more women

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.020 align:middle line:84%
would be giving birth in a
more straightforward way,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.695 align:middle line:84%
and would honor that yearning
by seeking those choices.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:90%


00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so of that
highly motivated group

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.240 align:middle line:84%
of women who are
understanding that they

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:84%
have to make particular
choices to back themselves.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.610 align:middle line:84%
So some of them
would seek me out.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Some of them would seek out some
other independent educators.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
But I guess not all of them are
accessing the sort of education

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.210 align:middle line:90%
that they might need either.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's quite tricky before
you come into this situation,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
to actually know what it is
that you need to be educated.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Another point that
makes that difficult

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.300 align:middle line:84%
is that maybe like me,
when I had my first baby,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.060 align:middle line:84%
there are women who have
such a trust in themselves

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:84%
and their own birthing
capacity, that they don't

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.590 align:middle line:90%
feel that they need education.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
After all, it's a normal,
physiological process

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:90%
of a healthy and well body.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't understand
is that the system really

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:84%
is not set up in order to
support their potential.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.933 align:middle line:84%
So they might not need
education to be understanding

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.850 align:middle line:84%
their own bodies, because
they might feel very

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.680 align:middle line:84%
clear and strong
in their own body,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
but they do need education to
see how the choices on offer

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.738 align:middle line:90%
are going to impact that.

00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not a level playing field.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:90%


00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that I feel happens,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
is that for these
women who are wanting

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.555 align:middle line:84%
to have a go at a normal
birth, that the hospital system

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:08.430 align:middle line:90%
sort of betrays them.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.740 align:middle line:84%
It in a way, lures
us in, feeling

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
like we've got it all covered,
that this will all be safe,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:90%
or it'll all be fine.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But most women don't
understand that that's

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
at the expense usually, of
their particular capacity

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
to give birth from
their own body system.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the hospitals
are set up really,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.692 align:middle line:84%
to control and to have major
surveillance looking to--

00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:34.980 align:middle line:84%
sort of premised on the
idea of worst case scenario

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:90%
for the mother and the baby.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.230 align:middle line:84%
And then most of the procedures
and the practices and protocols

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.630 align:middle line:84%
are based on that
worst case scenario,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and then applied back across to
all women, even low risk women.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And women don't really
understand this,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:90%
so they can just go in and be--

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.460 align:middle line:84%
feel like, well, any
hospital in any care setting

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
is going to give me
the same possibility

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:84%
of the birth unfolding in
the way that I want it to.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's really the education--
there's sort of a discernment,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.590 align:middle line:84%
choosing the things that are
really going to work for me.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.079 align:middle line:84%
Home birth, of
course, is ideally,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.579 align:middle line:84%
the place of the
mother's comfort

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:84%
and her place of
being able to really

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:90%
be in touch with herself.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Presumably, if women are
choosing a home birth,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.550 align:middle line:84%
they're choosing people who
they feel a warmth with,

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.610 align:middle line:84%
and that those people
will come into their home.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.690 align:middle line:84%
So it sets up the
best opportunity

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
for what we know
of their hormones

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and the physiological
process to unfold,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.220 align:middle line:84%
that closeness, that
warmth of relationship,

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.090 align:middle line:90%
the known caregivers.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So from that point
of view, home birth

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.740 align:middle line:84%
really matches what's needed
for a normal physiological

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:90%
childbirth.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
of course, home birth

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.280 align:middle line:84%
needs to sit within
a broader context

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
of that important
watching over and guidance

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.220 align:middle line:84%
that's required for maintaining
the aspect of safety.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.823 align:middle line:84%
So it's about
getting that balance,

00:05:08.823 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
about having the
caregivers who've

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.880 align:middle line:84%
got the watchful eye
and the quiet demeanor

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
to watch over and make sure
that things are unfolding

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:84%
in a straightforward way, but
really maximizing the place

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:84%
where the mother's able to
really be in her own body,

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:90%
and let that unfold.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.215 align:middle line:90%
So home birth-- good process.

00:05:26.215 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been doing births
for a long time, when I first

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:84%
had my own first
daughter, it was just

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.080 align:middle line:84%
that early time of
fathers coming in

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:90%
to be present at birth.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.090 align:middle line:84%
We were fighting to get the
fathers to be able to come in.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
Fathers at that time,
though, were coming in really

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.740 align:middle line:90%
as an observer.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.080 align:middle line:84%
They weren't actively
involved in the birth.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.990 align:middle line:84%
They were hardly were even
allowed to hold your hand.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, with
barely one generation in,

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
the young men who are
coming in as support people

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:84%
to be at the birth are expecting
to be strongly engaged and very

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:84%
physically engaged
in the birth process,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes to
receive the baby.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
But what we're also
coming to understand

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.160 align:middle line:84%
is that there's a
cost to that, in terms

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.690 align:middle line:84%
of the physiology of the
birth often with some mothers.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And I see it happening
that the dads can

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
be saying all the right things,
and trying to touch and hold

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.750 align:middle line:84%
in all the right ways, but
some of these crucial points

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.150 align:middle line:84%
in the labor where the mother
is just holding it together

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.692 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't quite
know how she's going

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.290 align:middle line:90%
to move through this part, or--

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and he might be saying
something that sounds fantastic,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.750 align:middle line:84%
but she looks at him with
that lack of credibility,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and saying, well, what
the fuck would you know?

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
You haven't done it.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.690 align:middle line:84%
How can you tell me that it's
OK, that I can keep going?

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.148 align:middle line:84%
Because you haven't
been there, and

00:07:00.148 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:90%
haven't walked this journey.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're understanding that
what helps women at those points

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
is really to be able to look
in the eyes of another woman

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.305 align:middle line:84%
who has been there, and who
when she says, you can do this,

00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:90%
this is the guidance.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:90%
This is the way to come through.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
This is the bit of
wisdom about how

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.210 align:middle line:84%
you can get through
this next contraction,

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:90%
or this next breath.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And that credibility
is so important

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:84%
to stabilize the
mother at that point.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.420 align:middle line:84%
What the research
seems to be suggesting

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.570 align:middle line:84%
is that since fathers have
been present at births,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and been there for the
birth of their babies,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.340 align:middle line:84%
that fathering itself is
changing out of sight.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.560 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing it's this
big social shift--

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.550 align:middle line:84%
fathers wanting to be
nurturing fathers, not just

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.970 align:middle line:84%
the provider father of
really that generation

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.323 align:middle line:84%
previously, or certainly
two generations ago--

00:07:50.323 --> 00:07:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and that researchers
are looking at that

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
fathers being exposed

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to those babies and
the hormonal processes

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:90%
and bonding that's happening.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.850 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, don't we want that?

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do-- how fabulous.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.710 align:middle line:84%
What researchers
are also suggesting,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.283 align:middle line:84%
though, is that in
the time that fathers

00:08:07.283 --> 00:08:08.700 align:middle line:84%
have been present
at birth, what's

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.325 align:middle line:84%
been happening to
the births themselves

00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:13.230 align:middle line:84%
is that the intervention rates
are going through the roof,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.440 align:middle line:84%
in the countries where this
phenomenon of fathers being

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:90%
present at birth is happening.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.880 align:middle line:84%
One part of that
is what I've just

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
suggested, about when the
going gets tough in that labor,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and the mother is
really needing something

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.070 align:middle line:84%
to hold onto, in terms of some
credibility and solidness,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:33.059 align:middle line:84%
have somebody who knows the next
step, the part of the journey--

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Fathers are firstly,
even if they're willing,

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.890 align:middle line:84%
don't have the credibility to
hold that particular space.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.620 align:middle line:84%
But also for the father,
that's quite a challenge

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
to be present with the
woman who he loves,

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
to see that awesome
potency of sometimes

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.160 align:middle line:90%
wildness and distress.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And we talk about
challenge, but really, these

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:84%
are all beautiful language
for talking about pain.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So that's quite a place to
have to hold, to watch that.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And many men are
not equipped to it,

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.543 align:middle line:84%
and not educated to be
able to normalize that.

00:09:08.543 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they're
going to freak out.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:90%
And they then want to--

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.450 align:middle line:84%
we talk about
archetypally, the knight

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:84%
on the white charger
coming and wanting to save

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.400 align:middle line:90%
this damsel in distress.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.500 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that sort
of psychological dynamic

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
between the couple
being played out.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:84%
And I do a lot of work
with midwives, as well as

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:90%
with some obstetricians.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And they do say that quite
often, the pain relief which

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
can be then the start of that
cascade of interventions,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
often comes in at the point when
the partners are distressed.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So that whole need to save
starts to come forward.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So the point I was making
before about that awareness

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
in the culture, about
having particular people who

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.530 align:middle line:84%
are the right people to hold
that space and enable women

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
to move through, particularly,
the difficult parts of labor,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.810 align:middle line:84%
the challenging parts
that relate to pain,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.520 align:middle line:84%
that often, the partner is not
that person at that moment.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And hence, a role for somebody
like me, or a midwife, or--

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:84%
who can hold that space and
encourage the mother on.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:84%
If women have made choices
that are going to support them

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.340 align:middle line:84%
in their birthing capacity,
the next big challenge

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.590 align:middle line:84%
that they face about how
that labor is going to unfold

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.490 align:middle line:84%
is what's going to
happen about pain.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Women, in that
situation, then need

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.290 align:middle line:84%
support for working with
that challenge of labor,

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.620 align:middle line:84%
that pain of labor, that
capacity to keep going.

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.720 align:middle line:84%
Often as the labor
is unfolding, they

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
reach points that I call
crises of confidence,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.910 align:middle line:84%
where what they'd
thought before the labor

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and what they're experiencing
now are sort of out of sync,

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.760 align:middle line:90%
and I feel like I can't do it.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it's the father
who is the main support

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.340 align:middle line:84%
person for the mother
in these situations--

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
and they can look pretty
dramatic and strong--

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.520 align:middle line:84%
the partners often
want to save the woman.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
They can't cope
with her distress

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and their own distress, so
they want to save the mother.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Whereas what the research
into the doula work is saying

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:84%
is that they are spaces where
an experienced other woman who's

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
walked that journey before
is more able to use the eye

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
contact and the words
to hold the woman,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and to encourage her,
and guide her through.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.115 align:middle line:84%
So I call it the
intimate holding circle,

00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:84%
the people that
the mother knows,

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.070 align:middle line:84%
who she's choosing to be
with her at the birth.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The father of the baby is likely
to be one of those people,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.030 align:middle line:84%
as well as hopefully, some
other experienced women.

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:84%
But when she's in that drama
of the crisis of confidence,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:50.342 align:middle line:84%
where what she wants is to
get out of this labor now--

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:84%
forget all the
things I said before

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.175 align:middle line:84%
about how much I
wanted to do it.

00:11:53.175 --> 00:11:56.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's too much, and I
don't want to do it anymore--

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.700 align:middle line:90%
she's looking for a weak link.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.460 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
It's a process I call
ringing the circle.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.270 align:middle line:90%
You see them.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:09.380 align:middle line:84%
They're going around
the eyes in that circle.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:14.660 align:middle line:84%
They're looking to see in
somebody's eyes sympathy.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.630 align:middle line:84%
They can smell the weak
link, because the weak link

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.280 align:middle line:90%
is full of fear.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And if they can feel the
fear, smell the fear,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.112 align:middle line:84%
and see the sympathy
in the eyes,

00:12:25.112 --> 00:12:26.570 align:middle line:84%
then they'll really
hit the jackpot

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:90%
in terms of a weakest link.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And that is very
often their partner,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.120 align:middle line:90%
the father of the baby.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So they will tend to--
even though they've

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
asked their partner to
be there, to support them

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.970 align:middle line:84%
through these moments, when
these pain dynamics get going,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:90%
this can start to unravel.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And if there's nobody
else in that circle who

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.620 align:middle line:84%
can hold that space,
then quite often,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.960 align:middle line:84%
we see the pain
medications, the pain--

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
in particular, epidurals,
and that whole cascade

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:55.115 align:middle line:90%
then starts to unfold.

00:12:55.115 --> 00:12:58.570 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.960 align:middle line:84%
In this labor bypass
era, in particular

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:07.390 align:middle line:84%
because of the aspect
about epidurals, yeah?

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So I talk about the siren
song of the epidural.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:18.220 align:middle line:84%
What possibility that epidurals
offer of pain free labor

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.720 align:middle line:84%
is that it has, I think,
undermined women's capacity

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
to stay with the
tough stuff of labor.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.950 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's lowered--

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.980 align:middle line:84%
in sporting vernacular, it's
changed not only the goalposts,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:84%
but we're on a different
playing field, which

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
means that for many women--
and I've done a lot of chat

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.600 align:middle line:84%
with midwives, and
they say this as well,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:84%
is that women are well
outside their comfort zone

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.342 align:middle line:84%
much earlier in the labor,
partly because they feel

00:13:43.342 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:84%
like they don't have to be
out of their comfort zone,

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.930 align:middle line:90%
that they could be comfortable.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
That's the promise that
the epidural offers.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it makes
a big difference

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:90%
to the process of the labor.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.610 align:middle line:84%
But it can offer comfort at
that level about the pain.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.463 align:middle line:84%
It used to be that
transition was understood

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:01.630 align:middle line:84%
to be the time when women
would feel like, you know,

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do this anymore.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.340 align:middle line:90%
I want to go home.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.215 align:middle line:84%
And even a home birth,
women would be saying,

00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:90%
I want to go home.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.730 align:middle line:84%
Basically, they just want
to get out of their bodies.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.240 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to be here
and feeling this anymore.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And that would be considered
to be in late first stage.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
I talk about a
crisis of confidence,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.873 align:middle line:84%
because there are points
well before transition where

00:14:20.873 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
the labor-- the hormones are
coming through more strongly,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and the labor is sort of
kicking up more intense,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
where women get a bit
disorganized and can start

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
to get panicky, feeling
like I can't do this,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.240 align:middle line:90%
it's getting too strong.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.907 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be more
and more and more.

00:14:32.907 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And the behaviors
that we used to think

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.260 align:middle line:84%
were transition are happening
much earlier in the labor,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
where women are saying,
I can't do it anymore.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:84%
It's too much-- getting
very distressed.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
So I, as an educator, felt I had
to talk about this differently.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I used the word,
a crisis of confidence,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.270 align:middle line:90%
to describe this point.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And whenever I do
presentations on it,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:00.490 align:middle line:84%
I always do this sort of
squiggly red fear, pain based,

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.250 align:middle line:84%
out of control feeling
that women have

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:84%
that relates to this
crisis of confidence.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And that from that
meaning that anything

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is going wrong in
the labor, actually,

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:84%
for experienced
caregivers, we're

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.350 align:middle line:84%
hanging out for the mother to
reach these bits of crisis.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Because they also
mark points at which

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.780 align:middle line:84%
they're shifting from their
conscious control into--

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:84%
if it's well supported--
into the deeper, sort of more

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
primal, instinctive
place that the birth will

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.220 align:middle line:90%
unfold so beautifully from.

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
So I found this badge, and I
thought, that's my symbol--

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.305 align:middle line:90%
crisis of confidence.

00:15:35.305 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
I get a lot of good feedback
not only from women, but also

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.560 align:middle line:84%
from their partners
about how helpful it

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
is for them to understand
that this isn't about anything

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:48.730 align:middle line:90%
medically going wrong.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about that sort of
challenging place in a labor,

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.250 align:middle line:90%
in this instance.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But they can apply it across
to their sporting endeavors,

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.450 align:middle line:84%
or taking on a new
task at work, or facing

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:90%
some challenge in some studies.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But there are
points in our lives

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.060 align:middle line:84%
where we need particular
experienced support

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to help us get through a point
where we're a bit disorganized

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't quite got
what the next step is.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.135 align:middle line:90%
And so a crisis of confidence--

00:16:22.135 --> 00:16:24.010 align:middle line:84%
people are able to see
that this doesn't only

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
relate to birthing, but it can
be a way of understanding life.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And that in most things in life,
we look for a bit of expertise

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.350 align:middle line:84%
when we're in one
of these crises.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And that feeds back again into
what I was saying earlier,

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.860 align:middle line:84%
about who are the appropriate
experienced people that women

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:84%
would have around them,
that they can sort of lean

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
into and trust that
they'll get the guidance

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
that they need about how
to keep going through this,

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:50.170 align:middle line:84%
rather than at these points
when these crises are coming up,

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.910 align:middle line:84%
have the whole
drug pathways come

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.730 align:middle line:84%
through that take that labor
off into a different point.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.310 align:middle line:90%


00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
People associate
it with me, so I

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.170 align:middle line:84%
was very happy to find a brooch
that I could wear that symbol.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.119 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.720 align:middle line:84%
If couples aren't
really aware of this--

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:90%
what I call pain dynamics--

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and certainly,
first of all, it can

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:84%
unfold into that cascade
of interventions.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.079 align:middle line:84%
So the birth that they
wanted to go that way,

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:90%
is now going this way.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:26.170 align:middle line:84%
So there can be disappointment
and grief around that change.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.390 align:middle line:84%
There can also be on the part
of the mother, a diminishment

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.120 align:middle line:84%
of her sense of
her own capacity,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.745 align:middle line:84%
because she had thought that she
was going to be able to do it,

00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and that she had that
great team around her.

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.840 align:middle line:84%
But outside of
that, there can also

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.290 align:middle line:90%
be in the couple relationship--

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.970 align:middle line:84%
ongoing relationship-- in a way,
the fathers are sort of damned

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.500 align:middle line:84%
if they do, or
damned if they don't.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Because women are often
feeling afterwards

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.280 align:middle line:84%
if he wasn't able
to hold that space,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:84%
they're feeling
disappointed in him,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.090 align:middle line:90%
or feeling like he let her down.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:03.522 align:middle line:84%
But in the moments when
he's trying to do his best,

00:18:03.522 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:84%
he either hasn't got the
credibility she needs,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.402 align:middle line:84%
so she dismisses what he's
saying, or his sympathy is up,

00:18:09.402 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:90%
and he's wanting to save her.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:90%
And so then that unfolds.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:84%
So I've done quite a lot of
couple counseling after birth,

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.270 align:middle line:84%
not only reviewing the birth
and unfolding what had happened,

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
but really working
out for the couple

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.080 align:middle line:84%
where their disappointments
with one another might be.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.580 align:middle line:84%
What the research
is saying is that

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.740 align:middle line:84%
for normal physiological
childbirth,

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.770 align:middle line:84%
women are best
supported by known,

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:40.690 align:middle line:84%
experienced
caregivers, one on one,

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:84%
continuously
throughout the labor.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.210 align:middle line:84%
That research that's coming out
of the doula research, as well

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.730 align:middle line:90%
as the midwifery research.

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of the key
aspects to it is

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.780 align:middle line:84%
this idea of
experienced caregivers,

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.740 align:middle line:90%
or experienced, known person.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the father
is known to the mother,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.562 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
experienced in birth.

00:18:58.562 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to get
that whole circle.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, when a
couple are supported

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
by somebody who has experience
in the whole journey of labor,

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
what it does is enable
the greatest strengths

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:84%
of the couple relationship
to come forward

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.830 align:middle line:90%
without that being strained.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Because in those moments
when that extra guidance

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and that extra support is--

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.730 align:middle line:84%
expertise is required,
that comes in,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.820 align:middle line:84%
is offered to the mother, she
moves through those sticky bits

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.340 align:middle line:84%
in the labor, and then
the couple relationship

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.310 align:middle line:84%
comes to the fore again, and
the couple do that dance.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And that enables the couple's
physicality to come forward,

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.150 align:middle line:84%
their sort of hormonal
and sensual connection

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.020 align:middle line:84%
to come forward, and also,
that beautiful bonding

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
between the couple and the
baby once the baby's born.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
When that extra level of support
and expertise isn't in there,

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
then that's when
we see this sort

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.670 align:middle line:84%
of dysfunction of this
dynamic between the couple,

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.710 align:middle line:90%
leading to--

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.250 align:middle line:84%
as I'm saying, either that need
or the wish on the partner's

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.760 align:middle line:84%
side to want to save the mother
from the hard work of it,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.535 align:middle line:84%
or the sort of place where
he's trying his best,

00:20:12.535 --> 00:20:14.410 align:middle line:84%
but she's unable to
really take that support,

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.827 align:middle line:84%
because she doesn't
feel like he's

00:20:15.827 --> 00:20:20.750 align:middle line:84%
got any credibility in this
particular point in time.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways I try and
explain that in my workshops--

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and I'm doing some writing
on this at the moment--

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.030 align:middle line:84%
is that pretty well
through our prehistory,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.010 align:middle line:84%
and if we think
about birth, we think

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.430 align:middle line:90%
about this is women's business.

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And we think about women being
supported by other women,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:90%
experienced women.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So we might say that that's
a deep layer of practice

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
in women's psyche.

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:84%
Some people call that
archetypal level.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I feel what's
happening is that women

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.270 align:middle line:84%
have this yearning, this
archetypal yearning to be

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:05.620 align:middle line:90%
supported by experienced women.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
But in our present era, they're
acculturated to assuming

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:90%
that this is their male partner.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And so the deep unconscious
expectation of the male partner

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.490 align:middle line:84%
to know exactly what to do, to
know exactly how to hold me,

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to know exactly the right
thing to say or not say,

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:32.540 align:middle line:84%
or without being
told, I think it's

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
a sort of a mismatch between
the deep yearning for having

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:41.340 align:middle line:84%
the experienced womanly
support around them--

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.760 align:middle line:84%
that that's a
mismatch for really,

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.610 align:middle line:84%
their partners, the men who
would be giving that support.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And when that all
unravels in the labor,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:84%
both the man and
the woman come out

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:84%
of that wondering,
what happened?

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And within a place
with one another

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.700 align:middle line:84%
where they'd been
through an experience

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
that they had thought was going
to be deeply bonding, only

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to find that there can be
some chinks of not exactly

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
estrangement, but
wondering, you know--

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:90%
that letting one another down.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
So in care settings where women
have got that circle of support

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
from experienced women
and their partner there,

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.140 align:middle line:84%
that's a beautiful
bringing forward

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.670 align:middle line:84%
of ancient wisdom that's lived
still in our deeper instincts,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:84%
as well as opening into
this new possibility

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.380 align:middle line:84%
for fathering that's
changing, for a deepening

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.740 align:middle line:84%
of the sensuality and
sexuality of the couple

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.960 align:middle line:84%
into their birthing
experience as well.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.490 align:middle line:84%
As I'm even saying
it to you, my body

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.520 align:middle line:84%
just is a-tingle with that
oxytocin and that experience,

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.040 align:middle line:84%
that I've had the privilege
to witness between couples.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.150 align:middle line:84%
As we're understanding
more about the hormones

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.180 align:middle line:84%
that are present in
the birth and how

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate that hormonal
process in the mother's body,

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.070 align:middle line:84%
we know that it relates
very much to the sensuality

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:22.020 align:middle line:84%
and the sexual
life of the mother.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Of course, having the father
present when he's supported

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:84%
as well as the woman
being supported

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:33.030 align:middle line:84%
by other experienced women, it
enables that deepened sexuality

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:37.410 align:middle line:84%
between the couple to be
an adjunct to the mother's

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.238 align:middle line:90%
birthing capacity.

00:23:40.238 --> 00:23:42.780 align:middle line:84%
You've probably heard that we're
talking about orgasmic birth

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you're putting it in
that context, then of course,

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:55.050 align:middle line:84%
the sexual partner
of the mother is

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:84%
part of a situation
that is going

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.170 align:middle line:84%
to enable that sexuality and
sensuality to come forward,

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.790 align:middle line:84%
which boosts the capacity for
the physiological in birth

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:04.755 align:middle line:90%
to be present.

00:24:04.755 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:90%


00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So where I think we're on
an exciting cusp of bringing

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.160 align:middle line:84%
some new threads together
that will bring the father

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.110 align:middle line:90%
in in a particular way.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But we need to also be mindful
of the ancient wisdom, which

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.230 align:middle line:84%
is really that this space
about sacred women's work,

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.290 align:middle line:90%
and how to blend those elements.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.500 align:middle line:84%
That's the point of
takeoff, I think.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:36.180 align:middle line:84%
For contemporary
birthing women, we really

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.380 align:middle line:84%
have to say that the
acculturation around them,

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:39.450 align:middle line:90%
the sort of--

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.000 align:middle line:84%
if you like, unconscious
education that they're getting

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.440 align:middle line:90%
is really all about fear.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.740 align:middle line:90%
The birth isn't to be trusted.

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:45.698 align:middle line:90%
It's a fearful process.

00:24:45.698 --> 00:24:47.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a very painful process.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.350 align:middle line:84%
They shouldn't
have to be martyrs.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a very negative education.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.220 align:middle line:84%
So for women who really
ideally have the capacity

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.450 align:middle line:84%
to give birth, and who might
want to action that, ideally,

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.190 align:middle line:84%
they would be
protecting themselves

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:08.630 align:middle line:84%
from that sort of
negative acculturation,

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:12.810 align:middle line:84%
and we'd call that
education, and be

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.670 align:middle line:84%
given different ways
of thinking about it,

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.640 align:middle line:84%
different visual images,
different understandings

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
about the sort of
consequences of the choices

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:90%
that they're making.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And ideally, that would
be happening a lot earlier

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.900 align:middle line:84%
in their lives,
long before they're

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.700 align:middle line:90%
ready to have that first baby.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Because there's an
acculturation that's

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.830 align:middle line:84%
living in their
unconscious, let alone

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:84%
in the conscious understandings
that they've got.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So that speaks to education well
back in their earlier years,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.990 align:middle line:84%
probably at least at
puberty, even before that.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So that they've got a
trust in the process, which

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.060 align:middle line:84%
has been eroded in the
culture that we're living in

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.120 align:middle line:90%


00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
I call this the
labor bypass era,

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:84%
where women are getting
strong messages about--

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
that they don't really have
to do their labors anymore.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
They could find people who would
rather do elective caesars,

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.970 align:middle line:84%
or they certainly don't have
to feel their labor anymore.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't value that process of
women working with their bodies

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:90%
to birth their babies--

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.892 align:middle line:90%
so the labor bypass era.

00:26:24.892 --> 00:26:27.350 align:middle line:84%
It's across the board in the
acculturation and the messages

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:90%
that women get.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Women who are still,
what I would call,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.008 align:middle line:84%
willing women, who
want to have a go--

00:26:34.008 --> 00:26:36.050 align:middle line:84%
they-- whether they really
understand it or not--

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.740 align:middle line:84%
are actually
counter-cultural women now.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.540 align:middle line:84%
They're going against what
their cultural message is,

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
by wanting to honor
their birthing capacity

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.530 align:middle line:84%
and give it a bit
of space to unfold.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:90%
It's been my life's work.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:57.020 align:middle line:84%
But really, I'm
speaking from still--

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.620 align:middle line:84%
Rhea, at 28, having
my first baby,

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:84%
wishing somebody had been
able to speak that to me

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.740 align:middle line:84%
before I was sort
of funneled down

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:84%
the choice that led me
to the birth experience

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
with my first daughter
that didn't really

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.650 align:middle line:84%
give me the satisfaction of
how I wanted that birth to be.

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.670 align:middle line:84%
The normal
physiological processes

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:84%
as it unfolds, has an ancient,
primal wisdom about it

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
in terms of
preparation for bonding

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and all those love
hormones coming through.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know that as human
beings, we're ever creative.

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So we can think ourselves into
love and loving those babies.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.710 align:middle line:84%
But the normal process
offers at the level

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:57.330 align:middle line:84%
of biology, a hormonal
grounding for that deep bonding.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And these human babies,
they're the most precarious

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.350 align:middle line:90%
of all the mammal babies.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
They need a few people who are
so strongly bonded to them,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:14.380 align:middle line:84%
that they're prepared
to put themselves out

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
in order to offer
what that child needs.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, offering it at a
physical level is one thing.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And even in our
present culture, I

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:30.700 align:middle line:84%
think we're privileging
the comfort of the couple

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.620 align:middle line:84%
to maintain the
lifestyle that they're

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:37.067 align:middle line:84%
getting used to over the
needs of the baby, even

00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:90%
at a physical level.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I would speak
to all the control crying,

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and that the baby has to
fit in with the lifestyle

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.360 align:middle line:84%
that we want to have,
rather than us attuning

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:90%
to what the baby's needs are.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have that at
a physical level.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.377 align:middle line:84%
But at a physical
level, that also

00:28:51.377 --> 00:28:53.980 align:middle line:90%
means that a hormonal level--

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm also interested
in and passionate

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.310 align:middle line:90%
about the psychological level--

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.690 align:middle line:84%
about what this is then, in
the psychological development

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.350 align:middle line:84%
of that child, the deep
attachment processes

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:09.160 align:middle line:90%
of the security of attachment.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.360 align:middle line:84%
All of that, normal,
physiological childbirth

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
offers the most
solid base for that

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:22.660 align:middle line:90%
to then be moving forward from.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.960 align:middle line:84%
Normal physiological childbirth
also offers the couple--

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.933 align:middle line:84%
if we understand the
stuff about the dynamics

00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:84%
about the relationship,
and making

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.975 align:middle line:84%
sure there's experienced
people there--

00:29:30.975 --> 00:29:33.880 align:middle line:84%
it offers the couple
a grounded place

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.540 align:middle line:84%
to start their
parenting from, which

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:42.383 align:middle line:84%
is a shared basis of hormone,
a shared basis of wish and hope

00:29:42.383 --> 00:29:43.675 align:middle line:90%
for a particular type of birth.

00:29:43.675 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:90%


00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't value
birthing and support it,

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:52.840 align:middle line:84%
certainly, we can
get babies born.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.330 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But we're missing out on
something of great depth.

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.050 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
When women are doing the work of
laboring well supported, they--

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:84%
you know, we call it
a rite of passage.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.280 align:middle line:90%
Now, a rite of passage--

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.640 align:middle line:84%
I know people undertake rites of
passage in all sorts of places

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.340 align:middle line:90%
and spaces in their lives.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.980 align:middle line:84%
But a rite of passage,
I guess, is at core,

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:84%
is something about coming
up against ourselves,

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.570 align:middle line:84%
being confronted by who
we are and our strengths

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and weaknesses, and
seeing how we're

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.340 align:middle line:84%
going to come through
some challenging process.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.430 align:middle line:84%
What part of me can
take me forward?

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:40.930 align:middle line:84%
What parts of me are going to
need to be strengthened a bit?

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.350 align:middle line:84%
What parts of me are
going to hold me back

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:90%
from taking on this challenge?

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we understand birth
to be the rite of passage

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:55.468 align:middle line:84%
into strong and
empowered mothering,

00:30:55.468 --> 00:30:58.850 align:middle line:84%
you know, 50 years of
parenting coming forward--

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.170 align:middle line:90%
pretty challenging process.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And the tempering
that the birth can

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:07.300 align:middle line:84%
give to the mother in the
deep parts of her being,

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen, to be ready for
that 50 years of challenging

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:12.920 align:middle line:90%
parenting--

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.460 align:middle line:90%
why would we want to miss it?

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.680 align:middle line:84%
We're being given-- women
are being told that they

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.750 align:middle line:90%
can be comfortable in birthing.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.970 align:middle line:90%
The epidurals can do it.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:84%
If we only do the
parts of parenting

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:34.300 align:middle line:84%
that we feel comfortable
with, pity help the kids.

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.700 align:middle line:84%
So there is something about
the template about birthing,

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.075 align:middle line:84%
and taking it on, and going
through that rite of passage,

00:31:39.075 --> 00:31:42.655 align:middle line:84%
having the support around that
helps you to move through that,

00:31:42.655 --> 00:31:47.200 align:middle line:84%
that sets a pattern in the
mother, at least-- and I think,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.630 align:middle line:90%
for the partners--

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to feel like with
the right support,

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.477 align:middle line:90%
I can take on anything.

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And with the right support, my
own strength will come forward.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is a fabulous place
to be starting our parenting

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.560 align:middle line:90%
journey from.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.020 align:middle line:84%
So I think that normal
birth offers us that.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:06.940 align:middle line:84%
In that rite of
passage aspect, where

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.820 align:middle line:84%
we're coming up
against ourselves,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.360 align:middle line:84%
we're often coming up
against our own wounds.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.850 align:middle line:84%
Our own wounds may be from
our own birth experiences,

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.123 align:middle line:84%
our own wounds from our early
years in our own family life.

00:32:21.123 --> 00:32:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And here we are
on this threshold,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:84%
ready to birth our own babies
and create our own families.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
So in that mix can come some
of those deep wounds, which

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:33.430 align:middle line:84%
might add to the layer
of fear that we have,

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:35.890 align:middle line:84%
or add to our layer of
feeling that we don't have

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.350 align:middle line:90%
the strength or the capacity.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I see over and over
again in births-- and I've now,

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
through these years
of doing birth,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:47.230 align:middle line:90%
been at over 1,000 births--

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:84%
that's a lot of hours of seeing
these transformative processes

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.020 align:middle line:90%
that women undergo--

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.910 align:middle line:84%
with the right support
and understanding,

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:59.680 align:middle line:84%
women can entirely surprise
themselves and move

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:90%
into transformed places--

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.010 align:middle line:84%
wounds that become
healed, wounds

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:12.520 align:middle line:84%
that then become sources of
strength for their parenting.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interventions
can get a baby born,

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.320 align:middle line:84%
but they don't give the mother
that place to really touch

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.120 align:middle line:90%
into her deepest being.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.550 align:middle line:84%
If you like, a lot of people
might call this soul work--

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.430 align:middle line:84%
what's more commonly now
being called soul work--

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to strengthen and
to transform things

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that have been weaknesses into
things that are now strengths

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.252 align:middle line:90%
for us and resource bases.

00:33:34.252 --> 00:33:36.760 align:middle line:84%
It's more commonly called
resilience training.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.030 align:middle line:84%
We're doing it with
kids, you know?

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Births are the complete
package for offering anybody

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:48.580 align:middle line:90%
who's in that circle--

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the mom, particularly,
but anybody else

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.390 align:middle line:84%
in that circle to
witness that work,

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:54.070 align:middle line:90%
and to give support for it.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
It offers on a plate, a
complete possibility for all

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.170 align:middle line:90%
these aspects to unfold.
