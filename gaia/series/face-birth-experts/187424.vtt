00:00:02.538 --> 00:00:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>> My name's Rick Porter.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm a consultant
obstetrician in Bath.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is an unusual
maternity service,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.500 align:middle line:84%
because we have about
5,500 deliveries,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.440 align:middle line:84%
of which about
2,000, slightly less,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.700 align:middle line:84%
take place either at home or
in midwife-led units, which

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:84%
most people in the
developed world would think

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.350 align:middle line:90%
was either impossible or mad.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And we think it's
possible and good.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.170 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I suppose one of the most
outstanding differences between

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:84%
our service and virtually
every other service-- well,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:84%
certainly every other service in
the UK and most other services

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
in Western Europe, with
the exception, obviously,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of Holland, with it's either,
depending on your viewpoint,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.000 align:middle line:84%
mad or enlightened
approach to childbirth--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that we have
between 35 and 40%--

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.600 align:middle line:84%
it varies, obviously, month
by month, quarter by quarter--

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:84%
about 35 to 40%
of our deliveries

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.170 align:middle line:84%
take place outside
the consultant unit.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
So 35 to 40% of our women
will deliver either at home

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:84%
or in an entirely midwife-led
environment, separated by quite

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.560 align:middle line:90%
long distances in many cases.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the nearest
midwife unit that we have

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
is 12 miles, whatever that is,
18, 19 kilometers from here.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is a figure which
most people don't believe.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And when they find
the figures, they

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
are truly astonished
because they

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.310 align:middle line:84%
would think that it
would be incompatible

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.980 align:middle line:84%
with modern practice
and furthermore,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:90%
incompatible with good outcomes.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.692 align:middle line:84%
Yet our outcomes
speak for themselves.

00:01:43.692 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no doubt, and I think
I speak for my colleagues

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
here, that we believe that
obstetricians are there

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.870 align:middle line:84%
for when we are needed
and emphatically

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:90%
not for when we're not needed.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
If you want to call that
firefighting, that's fine.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
But there is no question
in any of our minds

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
that when everything is
normal, that's not our role.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:90%
We're not there for that at all.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I think the relationship between
midwives and obstetricians

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.700 align:middle line:90%
is a very interesting one.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Jeffrey Chamberlain, who's a
great writer on obstetrics,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
once described it
as the two sides

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of an A. Neither side could
stand up without the other.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's absolutely
fundamental to our view

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on here.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
The midwives deal
with 90-plus percent--

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
95% of all contacts
with pregnant women

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:90%
within our service.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And they deal with
the normal stuff.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.660 align:middle line:84%
They recognize the abnormal,
and they refer where

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.600 align:middle line:90%
appropriate the abnormal to us.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
interestingly, we get

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
quite unhappy if we're
running an antenatal clinic

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and we see a succession
of normal women.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:90%
That is not what we want to do.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:84%
We want the midwives to
be the prime interface

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.360 align:middle line:84%
because they're much better
at dealing with normality.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.970 align:middle line:84%
They're much better
at relating to women

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
and talking to pregnant
women about the things

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:90%
that they want to talk about.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
I've never really
met an obstetrician

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:84%
who's at home talking to a
pregnant woman about makes

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.885 align:middle line:84%
of nappy or what to do
in terms of feeding bras

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:31.760 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
That's the sort of thing that
midwives completely relate to.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And they establish
a relationship

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
which is a very
special one with women,

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
and that's terribly
important to us.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.700 align:middle line:84%
The role of an obstetrician
when invited, and I think

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:84%
that is probably the right--
it's not too namby-pamby,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.640 align:middle line:84%
it really is true--
invited to get

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.130 align:middle line:84%
involved in a woman's pregnancy
is not a continuous one.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if a woman
was referred to any of us

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
with a pregnancy complication,
and if our view was

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.410 align:middle line:84%
that that complication had
been sorted and was no longer

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.550 align:middle line:84%
an issue, or alternatively, that
it was the kind of complication

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:84%
that would have no
impact on the delivery,

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.040 align:middle line:84%
we would have no
interest whatsoever

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:84%
in getting involved
in that delivery.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And it goes as far as saying
that if a woman was referred

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to us during pregnancy with
a perceived complication,

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
and if we came to the conclusion
that it no longer, as I say,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.800 align:middle line:84%
impacted, then we
would have no qualms

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
about them delivering
in one of our units,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.990 align:middle line:84%
which might be as far as
25 kilometers from Bath.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.620 align:middle line:84%
So we are perfectly at ease with
the idea of isolated elements

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.090 align:middle line:84%
of the package being provided
at the appropriate moment.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:84%
If a woman-- even in
labor, if a woman was

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
in labor here in this
hospital and was being looked

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
after by midwives,
and if we were

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
asked to give an opinion
on how the labor was going,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
we would have no
hesitation, if we concluded

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.320 align:middle line:84%
that there was no imminent
problem, in saying

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
to the midwives, thank you
for asking for my opinion.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.030 align:middle line:90%
Carry on.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Call me if you need me, but
otherwise I'm not involved.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:90%


00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I think it's fair to say that
we are all, whether we're

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
in a very high tech
environment or as low tech

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.120 align:middle line:84%
as we can achieve,
trying to reduce

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:90%
the number of Cesarean sections.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Do I think that we're using
technology to reduce that?

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think
everybody is, probably.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.360 align:middle line:84%
In other words, hopefully,
what they're doing is

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.450 align:middle line:84%
they're using technology
with an understanding

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.210 align:middle line:84%
of the limitations
of technology.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.420 align:middle line:84%
The most dangerous uses of
technology in maternity care

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
are the people who don't
understand the limitations

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:90%
of that technology.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:84%
If, for example, you would
take a cardiotocograph machine,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
a CTG machine, into a hospital
that had never seen a CTG

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:84%
machine before and had a
superficial understanding

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
of the role of that
machine, I would

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.780 align:middle line:84%
guarantee that the Cesarean
section rate would massively

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.660 align:middle line:84%
increase, because they
wouldn't understand

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the false positives involved
in that kind of technology.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.000 align:middle line:84%
So the most dangerous-- and this
applies right across the board,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
even within high tech
environments within

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.740 align:middle line:90%
the developed world--

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.540 align:middle line:84%
the real problem is when people
take a supposedly troubling

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.630 align:middle line:84%
sign on any form of evaluation
and believe it uncritically,

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:84%
because that's where you
end up with massive levels

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.180 align:middle line:90%
of intervention.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do,
the less confident

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you become in understanding
the realities of what's

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:90%
happening in that labor.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.975 align:middle line:90%
And it's relentless.

00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:06.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we're facing now,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's why every country
that has a Cesarean section

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.950 align:middle line:84%
rate of 40, 45, 50% or whatever,
should be deeply troubled

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
and should be looking intensely
at what's going wrong,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
because that cannot be described
in any way, in my book,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
as being anything
other than wrong.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.940 align:middle line:90%


00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The question of
the extent to which

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
women can choose
to have a Cesarean

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:90%
is a very interesting one.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:84%
Observation suggests
that in certain areas,

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
it's much easier to
get one than others.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether that's because of
the weight of consumer demand,

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.160 align:middle line:84%
consumer push within that area,
or whether it's to do with

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.670 align:middle line:84%
the malleability of
the obstetricians--

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's the obstetricians
who ultimately are

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.220 align:middle line:84%
the gatekeepers
towards a Cesarean--

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.690 align:middle line:90%
is quite difficult to pin down.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:90%
It's obviously a bit of both.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
The question is, how much are
the obstetricians a pushover,

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
and how much has consumer
demand become, as I would say,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.120 align:middle line:90%
perverted?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.780 align:middle line:84%
The suspicion is, for example,
that in London, there's

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.020 align:middle line:90%
far too much acquiescence.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But having said that,
those that are doing it

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.240 align:middle line:84%
would say that
they have not been

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
able to work out how
they can deny women

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:90%
this so-called right.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:45.600 align:middle line:84%
If you are, for example, working
in a conurbation and you have--

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
you're surrounded by
other potential providers

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.790 align:middle line:84%
of the service, it's very
difficult to dig your heels in,

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
because the consumer
will move elsewhere.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:84%
They will find the line
of least resistance.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
They'll find the obstetrician
that provides the service.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:90%
It may be no coincidence.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It may be inevitable
that, for example,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:84%
one of the lowest Cesarean
section rates in the UK

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
is in Cornwall, the
far end of Cornwall,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.650 align:middle line:84%
which is at the end
of a long peninsula.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
And in effect, there's
nowhere else for them to go.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.572 align:middle line:84%
So when an obstetrician
in Cornwall says,

00:09:21.572 --> 00:09:23.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you
should have a Cesarean,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:84%
they either have to
drive for 40 miles

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
in order to find an
alternative provider, which

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:84%
may be incredibly inconvenient
for all concerned,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.130 align:middle line:90%
or they just accept it.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, they have a
very low Cesarean section rate.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:84%
My impression, and it may
be a biased impression,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
is that over the years, more
obstetricians, substantially

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.750 align:middle line:84%
more obstetricians, have
come to the conclusion

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.260 align:middle line:84%
that choice is a really
important part here.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And they have accepted
that one of the guiding

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.940 align:middle line:84%
beacons, if you
like, of this service

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:90%
is that we provide choice.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.650 align:middle line:84%
And we don't provide a sort
of smokescreen of choice.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
We actually provide the
real, genuine article.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that quite
a few people who've

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
actually come to see
us are in some ways

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:24.798 align:middle line:90%
quite envious of what we do.

00:10:24.798 --> 00:10:26.340 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily
feel that they

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
would want to be part of it
because they don't necessarily

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.150 align:middle line:84%
feel confident enough
in their services

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.800 align:middle line:90%
to be able to introduce it.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think a lot
of people recognize

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
quite special about what

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:90%
we are genuinely able to offer.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's good
because 20 years ago, I

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have believed that
that was going to be the case.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.570 align:middle line:84%
Another way of answering the
question is that, for example,

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
two of the London
teaching hospitals

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
have actually visited us
and adapted their services

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
to get as close as
they can to our model.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And these are seriously
high tech environments,

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very proud of that.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.860 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
really delightful.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure that
the women who go

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.270 align:middle line:84%
through the experience
in these hospitals

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
are much impressed
by the new style.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.610 align:middle line:84%
In an area like
here, in Bath city,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.150 align:middle line:84%
where our home birth rate
is around the 10% mark,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
I would say the majority of them
choose home birth on the basis

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.970 align:middle line:90%
of, why on Earth not?

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Not based on a positive, I'm
going to be a pathfinder,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.960 align:middle line:90%
or I'm going to be--

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm a proto-Earth
mother or whatever,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:84%
but simply because
it's a natural process.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been going on for a few
years, as far as we know.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, why not
deliver in an environment

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
that you're comfortable in,
that you're familiar with,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by people
you love, with very few

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:90%
distracting noises?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
What I find so interesting
about observing--

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:84%
and we've known this
for a very long time--

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
Grantly Dick-Read, for example,
made observations on childbirth

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:90%
in undeveloped circumstances.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And we know, actually,
that women perform better,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.300 align:middle line:84%
they actually deliver
better, when they're at ease.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
A stressed woman may be
a very abnormal labor.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:84%
She may fail to dilate
because she's so anxious.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.560 align:middle line:84%
She may be in
excessive pain, which

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.930 align:middle line:90%
creates the cycle of anxiety.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And you just end up
with labors that don't

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.640 align:middle line:90%
follow the natural progression.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Whereas people
who are completely

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.680 align:middle line:84%
at ease, who have
understood about what birth

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.750 align:middle line:84%
is, as far as they
can do, obviously,

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.060 align:middle line:84%
if it's their first
delivery, just

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:90%
perform physiologically better.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
a lot of our women

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:84%
instinctively feel that, they
don't need the distraction

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.740 align:middle line:90%
of a high tech environment.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to be for them.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard that
again and again

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.540 align:middle line:84%
and again, not just from women
who are choosing home birth,

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.520 align:middle line:84%
but from women who
are choosing what is,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
after all, not a very
different option--

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.170 align:middle line:84%
that is, delivering
in a midwife-led unit,

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.150 align:middle line:84%
say, 15, 20, 25, or more
kilometers from here,

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.870 align:middle line:84%
because that's going
to be at least an hour

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
from decision to arrival
if they're transferred.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:84%
That's a long time
and a long distance.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So these are, in effect,
delivering at home

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.230 align:middle line:84%
without the hassle,
the mess, et cetera.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:84%
But they're all home
births, in a sense.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, they
love the idea of being

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
in a nice, relaxed,
calm environment.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And whenever you go
onto a labor ward,

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.350 align:middle line:84%
it's quite striking how that
is not what you're faced with.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:18.540 align:middle line:84%
However much everybody tries to
make it relaxed, uncluttered,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.550 align:middle line:84%
the moment you go onto
a busy labor ward,

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.780 align:middle line:90%
you know where you are.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.320 align:middle line:84%
You know you're in
a busy hospital--

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
the midwife station, doctors,
anesthetists, obstetricians,

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
anesthetists,
pediatricians, midwives

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
all milling around,
coming and going,

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.370 align:middle line:84%
lots of trolleys going
this way and that way,

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.130 align:middle line:84%
possibly noises of
women delivering,

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:90%
shouts, screams, et cetera.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.085 align:middle line:84%
It's not really
conducive to total calm.

00:14:44.085 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:90%


00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The medical model is
predicated on a belief

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.650 align:middle line:84%
that birth is unsafe
until proven safe.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So every delivery is a
disaster waiting to happen,

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and you can only
say in retrospect

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.280 align:middle line:84%
that it was safe and
wonderful and all the rest.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.740 align:middle line:84%
By contrast, the
natural/physiological approach

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
is a very much simpler one and
a much more optimistic one.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
It takes the polar
opposite view,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:23.490 align:middle line:84%
that birth is normal until
it is proven to be abnormal.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we, who all
of us subscribe to that view,

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.410 align:middle line:84%
are very happy with
the idea of us only

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:34.880 align:middle line:84%
being called on when needed,
because our default position is

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.730 align:middle line:84%
that we're not going to
be needed very often.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And the other
point about this is

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that those who subscribe
to the medical model

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:49.190 align:middle line:84%
get very easily locked into
a sort of conceptualization

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
of the role of the medical
attendant, which is

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.420 align:middle line:90%
quite rigid in many respects.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Again, coming back
to the point that I

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.850 align:middle line:84%
was making of
modular intervention,

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:84%
if you have a basic
position which

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.630 align:middle line:84%
says you are totally
involved as a physician,

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
as an obstetrician, then
you are totally involved

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.670 align:middle line:90%
at several stages in it.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And you get locked into
a negative view, which

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.810 align:middle line:84%
is completely unnecessary, as we
would say, as we would see it.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
If you, on the other hand, take
a positive view and one which

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.140 align:middle line:84%
says, it's not that I don't
want to be of help to everybody,

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:84%
it's just that I know that I
can't be of help to everybody,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.420 align:middle line:84%
that there are many,
many deliveries

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.010 align:middle line:84%
where I would probably be
disadvantageous-- you really

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:50.300 align:middle line:84%
don't need somebody whose
prime approach to childbirth

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:84%
is based on a
disease model getting

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:90%
involved in a normal delivery.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
They have nothing
to offer, nothing

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:84%
at all, apart from
potentially an adverse input.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:07.099 align:middle line:84%
And whichever way
you look at it,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:11.420 align:middle line:84%
midwives are far better at
handling normal deliveries

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.230 align:middle line:84%
than obstetricians, who
have other things to do,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
often very busy people, don't
necessarily want to wait.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:84%
How often have we all
seen obstetricians

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:84%
fidgeting, wanting this baby
out, that sort of thing?

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
That's not really quite
what it's all about.

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Midwives, on the other hand,
are there for the duration.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.430 align:middle line:90%
They have nothing else to do.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.300 align:middle line:90%
That is their focus.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Boing.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
You are going to have
your baby, and I'm

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
going to be with you
until you've delivered.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And if it's in 10
minutes, whoopee.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:49.010 align:middle line:84%
If it's in 3 hours and
47 minutes, so be it.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
sort of attendant,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
it seems to me,
that somebody needs

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:58.040 align:middle line:84%
in childbirth, and
absolutely not somebody who's

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:90%
got other things to do.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, it may be that
out there, there

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.760 align:middle line:84%
is a massive cohort
of obstetricians

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
who are prepared to
take exactly that view.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But I have to say, I
haven't met them yet.
