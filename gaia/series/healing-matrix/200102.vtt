00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Could it be that our body
is a map that can guide us

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.680 align:middle line:10%
to experiencing
health or imbalance?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we
ask the question,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:90%
how can we heal from truth?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Master healer Deborah
King is here with us today

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the chakra system,
defense mechanisms, and most

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:90%
importantly, healing trauma.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.410 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Deborah,
for joining us today

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:90%
on the "Healing Matrix."

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Great to be here, Sue.

00:00:49.562 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're going to
start with the beginning,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps you can share with
everyone a little bit about how

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.170 align:middle line:90%
things got started for you.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.420 align:middle line:84%
I know that in
your 20s, you were

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed with a pretty
significant condition

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.470 align:middle line:90%
of cervical cancer.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.629 align:middle line:90%
So can you share?

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I can.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.440 align:middle line:10%
So you know, I was a
hard-charging young lawyer,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:10%
just out of law
school, one year out.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990 align:middle line:10%
And I was going to take the
corporate world by storm, when

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:10%
I woke up one morning with a
diagnosis of cervical cancer,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.370 align:middle line:10%
and I was like,
whoa, wait a minute.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.560 align:middle line:10%
This isn't part of my game plan.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.010 align:middle line:10%
And it really threw
me off my course.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.250 align:middle line:10%
I stopped and pulled
back and actually took

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.470 align:middle line:10%
a look at myself, which wasn't
fashionable back then, Sue.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very common
now, but then, one--

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
at least in the corporate
world, one didn't do that.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that maybe
I had a couple issues.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And that I, before I
address the cancer,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.200 align:middle line:84%
perhaps there were
some preliminary things

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.370 align:middle line:90%
I needed to take a look at.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.747 align:middle line:84%
So first, I had to admit
to myself I clearly

00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:53.830 align:middle line:90%
had some addiction issues.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I was addicted to
alcohol and Valium.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And so I headed off
to AA and got my hands

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:90%
around that, my arms around it.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing I stumbled
on, very serendipitously,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.889 align:middle line:84%
again, not fashionable at
the time, was meditation.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Remember newspapers?

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.912 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw an
ad in a newspaper.

00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:15.995 align:middle line:90%
Want to learn to meditate?

00:02:15.995 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, hmm, that
sounds very appealing.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So I started meditating,
and between the clarity I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.370 align:middle line:84%
got from being clean and
sober and the clarity I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.450 align:middle line:84%
got from meditation, I
stumbled on energy healing.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And by then, I had
realized that there

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
had to be some connection
between my emotions

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.937 align:middle line:84%
and this disease process,
surely, you know,

00:02:36.937 --> 00:02:38.270 align:middle line:90%
although it wasn't talked about.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:90%
It just seemed logical.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had even
started journaling.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.190 align:middle line:84%
I was carrying my
yellow pad around

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
like a good young
lawyer in pearls,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.040 align:middle line:84%
and I would journal my
emotions during the day.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.190 align:middle line:84%
And about that time, I
stumbled on energy healing.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I had three sessions
with an energy healer

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
and had what was an amazing
spontaneous remission.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:90%
I knew it.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.250 align:middle line:90%
She knew it.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the teaching
hospital a day or two

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.470 align:middle line:84%
later and had them take
a look, and, of course,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
they said the proverbial,
whatever you're doing,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.120 align:middle line:84%
keep doing it, because
it appears to be gone.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So that left me with what
made the cancer come?

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:90%
What made the cancer leave?

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Could this phenomena be
reproduced for myself?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.920 align:middle line:90%
What about others?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And even better, what if we
could prevent it all together?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I
started my journey.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank you
for sharing that.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
It's deep to go into these
places within ourselves

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and so very important.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, we didn't know
about that years and years ago.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, there was a reference
to childhood trauma

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:84%
that you made earlier
in conversation.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything
about that that you

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.258 align:middle line:84%
can share with us,
about how that's

00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:58.170 align:middle line:84%
connected to the emotions that
were needing to be addressed?

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, surely, I had
buried it all pretty deep.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I was conscious of the fact,
I had been sexually abused

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
as a child, but
like most people,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.020 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to deal with it.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I find
working with people

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.260 align:middle line:84%
is that a lot of people,
they have memories,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.810 align:middle line:84%
but they hope if they just
push it down somewhere--

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
but that's what happens when
we push our emotions down

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:90%
somewhere.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.268 align:middle line:84%
We're storing them
in our body field,

00:04:20.268 --> 00:04:21.810 align:middle line:84%
in our body and our
mind, and they're

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.227 align:middle line:84%
going to come back
later and haunt

00:04:23.227 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
us, which was mine just came
back earlier to haunt me.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:10%
And the way I really managed
that, besides energy work,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:10%
was I wrote a book
about it, which was

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.775 align:middle line:10%
a very cathartic experience.

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:10%
>> It's kind of like we
have these broad shoulders.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:10%
We can manage this,
and so we just go on.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And we don't even realize that
we're stuffing those things

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
We're just moving
on, moving forward,

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.912 align:middle line:84%
but that energy is in
there, playing a role,

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
playing a part in stealing some
of the energy that could be

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.648 align:middle line:90%
used for healing automatically.

00:04:52.648 --> 00:04:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's stealing a
major part of your energy.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps as much as 95%
of your personal energy

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:84%
is going to maintaining
this secret, a secret you

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.125 align:middle line:84%
don't want people to know,
whatever your secret might be.

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a huge drain
on your physiology,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and your psychology,
it's a big drain.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so important for our
viewers to recognize that some

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.002 align:middle line:84%
of these habits may be
instilled in one's lifestyle,

00:05:18.002 --> 00:05:20.460 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even realize
it, because they've been living

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
inside of that
for so many years.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.610 align:middle line:84%
It's just how they
function, who they are.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's important for us to
make this connection for people

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
to allow people to recognize,
hey, if I am, you know,

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
not OK if I don't
exercise, and I'm not OK

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.050 align:middle line:84%
if I don't get to
do this, or if I

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
have to control
my circumstances,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.890 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it's something
like what you're sharing.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.570 align:middle line:84%
That something's
been suppressed,

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and this energy is
trying to overcompensate

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
for that, which could end up in
some pretty serious diagnoses.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it's not even
suppression, necessarily.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just that for so
many of us, for so long,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:90%
we're simply not aware.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
We're not aware, and it takes
time to develop self-awareness.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And tools-- and I found that
journaling and meditation

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
are two of the
best to develop how

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.360 align:middle line:84%
do I really feel about
something in all sincerity

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.538 align:middle line:84%
without having to
publish my feelings.

00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
That's what I really
encourage people

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.720 align:middle line:84%
to do, to get in touch
with their feelings.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And you came upon
recognizing this introspection.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.820 align:middle line:84%
You discovered there's some
feelings that I need to feel.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And then you translated
that over time

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.102 align:middle line:84%
into working with the chakra
system, as you've mentioned.

00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Can you just tie that
together for our viewers?

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me go back and pick
up a really important step that

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.060 align:middle line:84%
was critical, at
least in my history.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.870 align:middle line:84%
So when I left the teaching
hospital in San Francisco

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and started down to the
curb with this clean bill

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:84%
of health-- you know, everyone
wants Western medicine

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
to say, yes, we see
nothing on the X-ray.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
So lucky me, I had that moment.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I descended
the steps, I tripped

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.460 align:middle line:90%
on the curb over a kiosk.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:84%
I had in my mind,
I was thinking,

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to go study energy
medicine with that practitioner

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:84%
from whom I just had
this amazing remission.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
But I tripped over this kiosk,
and as I fell toward the curb,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.175 align:middle line:84%
I saw the words
"healing" on a flyer.

00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:11.050 align:middle line:84%
So I pulled the flyer
out, hopped in the cab,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.440 align:middle line:84%
read the flyer on the way back
to the hotel, and it was an--

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd never heard of-- esoteric,
very small Christian group that

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
practiced what
they called prayer,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.610 align:middle line:84%
but in fact, sure sounded
a lot like healing.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.720 align:middle line:84%
So just out of curiosity,
I called them up,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:90%
and I ended up staying 10 years.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I learned the most
amazing what we would, perhaps,

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.155 align:middle line:84%
call remote healing
or distance healing,

00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:43.480 align:middle line:84%
from these elderly people,
who lived these quiet lives

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:90%
of total alignment.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
You know, they were just so in
sync with source, with spirit,

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:90%
and they taught me so much.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up working
in their institution.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.630 align:middle line:84%
They had an actual institution,
where it was pretty uncanny,

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I had months and months, months,
maybe years of preparation

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:90%
before I got to go work there.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And the people there were sick,
although we never said so.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.870 align:middle line:84%
We didn't wear white,
those of us who were staff.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
You arrived every day,
and once a week, you

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.750 align:middle line:84%
were assigned a new
guest, not a patient.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.990 align:middle line:84%
And whatever their
state, you had

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:84%
been taught how to picture
them in their perfection, yeah,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.310 align:middle line:90%
no matter what.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:31.877 align:middle line:84%
And my very first assignment
was I opened the door

00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:33.460 align:middle line:84%
and I walked in, and
I promptly forgot

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:90%
everything I'd been taught.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Because here was a
woman in her 50s,

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.909 align:middle line:90%
who clearly had had a stroke.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So I went Western.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.450 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was like, oh,
my god, she's had a stroke.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.590 align:middle line:84%
I forgot what I'd been
taught and panicked.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.030 align:middle line:84%
But then within a few
minutes, I got back into gear

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and sat there and projected
her original perfection back

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:90%
over her.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a pretty
intense experience.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:90%
It teaches you unbending intent.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.950 align:middle line:84%
They were extraordinarily
gifted people.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:84%
But I ultimately
left after 10 years.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Sadly, I wanted--

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I still wanted to study
chakra-based healing.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So I did a 180 and went
over to chakra school,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.740 align:middle line:90%
where I enrolled.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in the back of the room
minding my own business and not

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.920 align:middle line:84%
there very long, and the
teacher goes, you back there,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:84%
where'd you learn that distance
healing thing you're doing?

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I said, where I'm
from, we call that prayer.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:90%
So you see the overlap.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, yeah, and this is
something that is so important

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:90%
for people to hear--

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
that we actually
have the capacity

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:84%
to be a healing presence on the
planet, that everyone has this.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And that as we learn to
come home to ourselves

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:84%
and to be present in this way,
that many would call prayer,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:84%
some would call
ceremonial healing,

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.210 align:middle line:84%
but it's actually just
dropping into our true self.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
We not only can heal
ourselves, but it

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.950 align:middle line:84%
has a healing effect in
our energy field, which

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.590 align:middle line:84%
overlaps and can be
projected and can

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:02.810 align:middle line:84%
be embracing of people
thousands of miles away.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a new world for
us to be exploring,

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and I know our viewers are
very interested in being

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.340 align:middle line:84%
a part of that and
engaging in this

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.680 align:middle line:84%
and taking healing back
into our own hands,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.700 align:middle line:84%
rather than being dependent
upon medications or all

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.440 align:middle line:84%
of the other ways that we
suppress or deny or remain

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.150 align:middle line:84%
unaware of the true issues
at hand and our true power.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful thing that
you're bringing forward,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so happy to
hear you sharing this.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Just you're innocently
sitting there

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.870 align:middle line:84%
minding your own business,
and somebody says, hey,

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.770 align:middle line:90%
what's that?

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.505 align:middle line:84%
So thank you for pursuing that
and integrating it and sharing

00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
these things with
people that are--

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've been teaching this
work now for almost 40 years.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And probably one of the
most significant things

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.350 align:middle line:84%
that I try to teach,
and one of the hardest--

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.680 align:middle line:84%
I just taught a live
workshop last week--

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:84%
well, there are two
really significant ones.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.630 align:middle line:84%
One is forging a serious enough
connection to source however

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:90%
you perceive that.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
That whatever you want to call
that force field that surrounds

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.520 align:middle line:90%
us and interpenetrates us.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
And for some people,
it's their higher self.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.960 align:middle line:90%
For others it's more of a deity.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it can be just
anything, anything

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.020 align:middle line:84%
that works for the person
I'm teaching or helping.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
fairly tricky part

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:84%
is merging that
energy with your own.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, not being
separate from the source.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, we're going to get
into some things like that.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
So we started to speak
about the chakra system,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and you went off
to chakra school.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And so can you just kind
of bridge for our viewers

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.760 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between
working with chakras and healing

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
trauma, because we
really want people

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:57.000 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
relationship between the two.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Sure, so you're basically
setting inside a bubble

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.540 align:middle line:84%
of energy right now, your
own personal energy field.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And it encompasses and
interpenetrates your body.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's connected to the larger
energy field that encompasses

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.770 align:middle line:90%
the entire universe.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.043 align:middle line:84%
And you have focal
points in this field,

00:12:16.043 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
in your personal energy
field, that we call chakras.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.080 align:middle line:90%
It's Sanskrit.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.910 align:middle line:90%
It just means "wheel of light."

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And there are seven major
ones that run down your spine.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are hundreds of minor
ones in your hands and feet

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere that tend to light
up when you become involved

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.190 align:middle line:90%
with this sort of work.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And each chakra is like a
charging station or a way

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:45.240 align:middle line:84%
station, where emotional
material comes in and out.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.410 align:middle line:84%
So chakras are really helpful
to people to learn about

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
because it's-- they find
out it's their emotions

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.555 align:middle line:90%
that's powering everything.

00:12:54.555 --> 00:12:56.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
else in their body

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:90%
that's making everything work.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.780 align:middle line:84%
It's actually their
emotional material.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And when we block
our emotions, we

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.600 align:middle line:84%
stop the movement of one or
more of those little wheels

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.700 align:middle line:90%
of light, those little chakras.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And that impacts our
body pretty soon,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:90%
because it's pretty simple.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're holding down and
pressing something in a lot

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
and not going to feel that
heartache, that heartbreak

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
that you just had, pretty
soon, the energy in your chest

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is going to kind
of grind to a halt.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's not good
for your arteries

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.330 align:middle line:84%
or your veins or your heart,
your heart organ itself.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So you want chakras to be
open, balanced, charged,

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
and in dynamic interplay
with the environment.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:90%
You want movement.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.080 align:middle line:84%
You want energy
coming in and out.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> As we deal with our emotions
that are untapped or unresolved

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
or just underneath the
level of consciousness,

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
into the subconscious
realms of our being,

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.490 align:middle line:84%
then it allows this
energy to flow again,

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.210 align:middle line:84%
which nurtures
the chakra system,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.140 align:middle line:84%
which allows this
movement to reinstate.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Is this basically
what you're saying.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, to some degree.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's correct.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, let's back up and say,
when trauma occurs and it's not

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
dealt with in anything more
than a survival response,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:90%
because we're trying to--

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Survive.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Survive, get through it.

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
After that, we get down the
road having survived this

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.748 align:middle line:84%
but maybe we haven't
really dealt with it.

00:14:28.748 --> 00:14:29.790 align:middle line:90%
We haven't really healed.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.110 align:middle line:84%
We haven't really
come to terms with it.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And in that situation,
what forms of expression

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
do you see trauma showing
up inside of people

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
when they haven't dealt with
it on a healing tone level?

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the easiest one for
most people to grasp right off

00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:90%
the bat is their heart.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Because we can really feel
when we close our heart,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.017 align:middle line:90%
we know we have.

00:14:52.017 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:90%
We're like, you know what?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.225 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to feel that.

00:14:54.225 --> 00:14:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm never going to acknowledge
that my partner did

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
that to me, betrayed me
in that way, or my mother,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.040 align:middle line:90%
could be anyone.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:10%
And we literally
close the chakra down,

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:10%
which does not
allow any interplay.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at your
base chakra and compare that,

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:84%
that's the one that's at
the base of your spine.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.580 align:middle line:90%
You're sitting on it right now.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And typical trauma there
would be an accident.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
You're driving
along, and suddenly,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.660 align:middle line:84%
you're either in an accident
or you witness an accident,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.400 align:middle line:90%
either one can do it.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.380 align:middle line:84%
You can even witness
something on television

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.330 align:middle line:90%
that's terribly upsetting.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
You know, the whole
nation's base chakra

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:90%
was in upheaval at 9/11.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And we all watched that
on television for days.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can feel
your base chakra

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
when it goes out of whack,
because you pull up.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.420 align:middle line:90%
You pull it up.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.990 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we
disconnect from the Earth,

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.740 align:middle line:84%
which is the thing
that's keeping us safe.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.930 align:middle line:84%
So now we feel less
safe, because we just

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
cranked our base
chakra up, way up here.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're walking around,
and we know we don't feel safe.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.137 align:middle line:84%
And we need Mother
Earth connected to us,

00:16:03.137 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
up through our feet and
up through our base chakra

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
to feel like we're going
to stay on the planet.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's-- base chakra
typical trauma is an accident.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Another typical, classical
one would be any shock.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.678 align:middle line:84%
Any big surprise makes
us pull up and out.

00:16:22.678 --> 00:16:23.970 align:middle line:90%
>> We kind of unroot ourselves.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we sure do.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We just pick up our roots and
head down the road and go find

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:90%
someplace safe.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.993 align:middle line:84%
>> And run down the
road, roots in hand.

00:16:28.993 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:90%
Not good.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Not good.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.668 align:middle line:84%
Well, roots in the
soil, not in the hand.

00:16:32.668 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, just picture
a tree doing that,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and you see the problem
right off the bat.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That's not going
to work for very long.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's just go
to the second chakra.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.090 align:middle line:90%
What if that were happening?

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
Let's just kind of
work up the system,

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and so people can
relate a little bit.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so I had horrific
second chakra issues,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:90%
obviously, with cervical cancer.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is often related
to things that are

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.650 align:middle line:90%
sexual or sensual or emotional.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's your emotional
body is pretty much

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:06.390 align:middle line:90%
sitting in your lower belly.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
feel things so strongly.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And for women, the
next thing they know,

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
they're going to have
some sort of a problem

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.520 align:middle line:84%
with their reproductive
system, somewhere.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Can be in the breasts, of
course, but more classically,

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.140 align:middle line:90%
it's more likely in the--

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Deep pelvic area.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in the
reproductive area.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And for a man, he might
have issues with prostate.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.710 align:middle line:90%
It's really classic.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And so it all has to do with
relationships and our wisdom

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and allowing this
to be cultivated.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's where we--

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
the second chakra area
is where we create.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing you'll
know, if your second chakra

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:54.480 align:middle line:84%
is totally shut down or
dysfunctional or closed,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
is that, wow, your
creativity just dries up,

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:02.080 align:middle line:84%
whether you're a chef
or a dancer or a writer.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's whatever you're--

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:90%
you know, an accountant.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're
creating suddenly

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.047 align:middle line:90%
seems flat, stale, not moving.

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I've got nothing.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the
second and the fifth,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
just to digress for a moment,
the fifth and the second

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.690 align:middle line:84%
are really connected,
especially in women,

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and classically, you'll see
that the rate of harassment,

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
sexual harassment of
women is quite high.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they'll shut
the thing down so

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:90%
they won't get harassed again.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
they know, they

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.472 align:middle line:84%
can't express
through their throat.

00:18:33.472 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you create here,
but it has to come out here.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.597 align:middle line:84%
>> So then they can't
speak up for themselves.

00:18:37.597 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:90%
They can't state their truth.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Or speak anything, right.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, And the third chakra?

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
Just overview.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the third chakra is
all about you and your sense

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.630 align:middle line:90%
of self-esteem.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's the one that maybe
goes out of balance easiest,

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.970 align:middle line:90%
because it's so easy to go--

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
to be ahead of ourselves
and maybe be a little bit

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
on push on other
people or be too behind

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:90%
and let people walking on you.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.303 align:middle line:84%
And I always noticed careers
have a lot to do with this.

00:19:10.303 --> 00:19:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, I've never seen
a lawyer, frankly,

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.077 align:middle line:84%
that didn't have a
little bit of a--

00:19:14.077 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll raise my hand
there, a little bit

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:90%
of an excessive third chakra.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Finding power, finding--

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
externalizing our power and
then charging forth with it

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:90%
to make things happen.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, make it happen.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.700 align:middle line:90%
Make it happen.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Instead of being in flow.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
We start to perceive ourselves
as this separate self that

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
has to, if I'm not going to do
it, you know, who's going to?

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So I've got gotta get out
there and make my way, which

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.920 align:middle line:90%
depletes us over time, right?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:84%
We can't just run that way
as a separate individual.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.767 align:middle line:90%
We get used up.

00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So then you mentioned the
heart chakra, of course,

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.010 align:middle line:90%
and the throat chakra is--

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> All about expressions.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Manifesting or
speaking our truth.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, four out of every five
prescriptions for underactive

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:90%
thyroid are given to women.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:90%
That's a very telling fact.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Shutting down, shutting down.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We learn early to
swallow it, not express it.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So fortunately,
times are changing.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And people are like, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to not come out.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And so let's go just
quickly and tap the sixth

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.655 align:middle line:84%
and the seventh just to
lay this out for people.

00:20:20.655 --> 00:20:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let me back down just
a little bit here and talk about

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
the thymus, because I would
be remiss not to mention it.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
So the thymus
gland is incredibly

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.720 align:middle line:84%
important in the energy
field because not

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.550 align:middle line:84%
just the seat of
your immune function,

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.010 align:middle line:84%
to me, more importantly, it's
the seat of spirituality.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And so I usually put a
fair amount of attention

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
on the thymus and develop
it for the individual

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.790 align:middle line:90%
and help it expand.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
The West would tell
you, it's shrinking

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:53.190 align:middle line:84%
if you're over the age of 10 or
12, but, in fact, it can grow.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:90%
It can grow.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, shrinking only because
we're not learning how to use

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.970 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
Shrinking only because
we're rendering

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:84%
it obsolete by overthinking,
instead of allowing this heart

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:84%
chakra, the thymus association,
and allowing this to be robust.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.940 align:middle line:84%
We've been ignoring
that it's smart to love.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.890 align:middle line:84%
fortunately, science
is now showing us

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
that it is, in fact, a
brilliant thing to engage in,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.920 align:middle line:84%
regarding healing and
creating a life that

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:90%
serves us and serves everyone.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, so can we go to the--

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>> The third eye?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:90%
>> -- the third eye.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.236 align:middle line:90%
>> The infamous third eye.

00:21:27.236 --> 00:21:28.069 align:middle line:90%
>> The sixth chakra.

00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the sixth chakra.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So all about vision and
your future and planning

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.830 align:middle line:90%
and your intuition.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's just such a wide
open field of possibilities.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And so many-- we haven't
talked about specific disease

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
processes that match each
one of these energy centers,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:90%
but there are, of course.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:84%
But the sixth and seventh have
maybe the most shocking number

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of--

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
20 different things that can
go wrong if you close yourself

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
down up here, between the pineal
and the parathyroid and all

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.410 align:middle line:84%
these glands, I
mean, you can really

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.660 align:middle line:90%
shut yourself down there.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:90%
By refusing to see.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.120 align:middle line:90%
I will not see that.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I will not see
that is the message

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.810 align:middle line:90%
of a dysfunctional sixth.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, yes, and the pituitary
that is involved is this master

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.550 align:middle line:90%
gland.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.893 align:middle line:84%
So all the chemistry just
starts to get imbalanced,

00:22:22.893 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
and the next thing you
know, we're rolling out

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.760 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of
symptom patterns,

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:84%
all because we're not
allowing intuition

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
and receptivity of
this divine energy,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of this cosmic, bigger
bubble of energy

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
that you were
describing earlier.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And just to talk about
symptoms for a moment--

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.810 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people it always
starts with something simple.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:47.670 align:middle line:84%
You know you're not quite OK,
and you'll go into the doctor.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And you'll say,
something's just off.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:51.570 align:middle line:90%
I can tell.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.737 align:middle line:84%
And while they can't find
anything quite that early,

00:22:53.737 --> 00:22:54.680 align:middle line:90%
but you know.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe it started with
you're not sleeping the same

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.050 align:middle line:84%
or you're not eating the same or
you have just slight headaches.

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So your body sends
you information.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.840 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to
communicate with you,

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.540 align:middle line:84%
but you're just a little too
early for standard testing

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.770 align:middle line:90%
to pick up on it.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Not too early for an energy
healer to pick up on it

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.960 align:middle line:84%
but a little too
early for an X-ray.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and I love this--
or even blood tests.

00:23:19.612 --> 00:23:22.070 align:middle line:84%
We can pick up on this energy
before a blood test will even

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.620 align:middle line:90%
show something.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So they go and they
do these tests,

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:25.248 align:middle line:84%
and they say there's
nothing wrong.

00:23:25.248 --> 00:23:27.993 align:middle line:84%
And then we go home and we shut
down our own intuition more

00:23:27.993 --> 00:23:29.410 align:middle line:84%
because they didn't
agree with it.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:31.020 align:middle line:90%
So they told us it didn't exist.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.138 align:middle line:90%
It's all in my head.

00:23:32.138 --> 00:23:33.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not all in our head.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.722 align:middle line:84%
It's in our energy
body, and our head

00:23:34.722 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:90%
is starting to perceive that.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I'm so
thrilled that you're

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.840 align:middle line:84%
doing the work that
you're doing and teaching

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.630 align:middle line:84%
people how to start to assess
and to sense and to feel

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.620 align:middle line:84%
and perceive this, because
this is the true master healer.

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:90%
The true healer within.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's so easy to teach
because they already know how

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.642 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:23:51.642 --> 00:23:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And for thousands of years,
we've known how to do it.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
We've just shut it
off and shut it down.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> In our culture, definitely,
we're just not tapped in.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> By the time you're seven,
we've taught this little child

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.680 align:middle line:90%
that he or she should--

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
you think you see grandmother
over there, but she's deceased.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't really.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And so there goes
that, you know?

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:90%
Shut that one down.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And by the time, again,
we stop using anything

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:84%
that could be,
remotely be construed

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
as beyond normal and we go just
to the standard five senses.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, it's
so easy to turn

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:84%
on a whole roomful of people to
their higher sensing abilities

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:90%
because they're just latent.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.230 align:middle line:84%
They're in their
cellular structure.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.730 align:middle line:90%
It's in our DNA, those memories.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So boom, they, all
of a sudden, they

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:41.850 align:middle line:84%
can hear more than the normal
realm or see more or feel more.

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, it's like a super
sensory self starts to open up.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's so exciting for
them to be awake and alert

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.110 align:middle line:84%
and realize they have all of
these abilities as a natural

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.910 align:middle line:90%
healer.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:54.680 align:middle line:90%
They are a natural born healer.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.705 align:middle line:84%
They can heal themselves, and
with not that much training,

00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:90%
they can heal others.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they have to drop
into their bodies and root

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Can you just repeat again a
little bit about this root

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.920 align:middle line:90%
chakra, the first chakra?

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems that if
we get started right away

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
uprooting and
heading down the road

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.380 align:middle line:84%
in a protective, guarded
state, that we don't really

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:84%
stand a chance to open up
to this super sensory being

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.170 align:middle line:90%
that we truly are.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So just for our viewers'
sake, can you just

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.425 align:middle line:84%
circle back around and just
remind us some of the things

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:29.090 align:middle line:90%
that the first chakra is.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:33.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I can and maybe even go to
the first level of the field

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.520 align:middle line:10%
to start with as a concept.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:10%
So your energy field has
levels and these chakras

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.570 align:middle line:10%
are sitting in them.

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.650 align:middle line:84%
There's one cupped in each
of the levels that matches.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:84%
And the first level
of your energy field

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.557 align:middle line:84%
is only a half inch to an inch
outside your physical body.

00:25:48.557 --> 00:25:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Again, it interpenetrates.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little
beyond our linear--

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:52.832 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there's overlap, yeah.

00:25:52.832 --> 00:25:55.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, our linear thinking
can't quite take it it,

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
but we say interpenetrate,
and then you get it.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And that first level matches
your physical body to a T,

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's that
base chakra sitting

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.150 align:middle line:84%
right at the base
of the spine, in it.

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
ways to keep your base

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:90%
chakra alive and well--

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.300 align:middle line:84%
from any kind of
movement indoors,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
dancing or yoga or stretching,
or any kind of movement,

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
outside, any connection
to Mother Earth.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I am always urging people
to save some time out

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:84%
of the gym for outside,
because you really

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.920 align:middle line:84%
need some connection
to the horizon,

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to the sun, the moon, the
trees, and the ground.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:84%
We need that, and we're
getting away from it.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.720 align:middle line:84%
Especially children, they hardly
get any time outdoors anymore.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you're a gym
rat, just take 10 or 15

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.000 align:middle line:84%
minutes at the end
of your workout

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.590 align:middle line:90%
and save it for outdoors.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.902 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I couldn't agree more.

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
reminding people of that.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
We're so computered
up and video gamed in

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:84%
that we're unplugging
without even realizing.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.725 align:middle line:84%
We're never developing
those roots to begin with.

00:27:03.725 --> 00:27:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of Deborah
King's students

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.290 align:middle line:84%
have used Deborah's work
to heal themselves and have

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:90%
become healers as well.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.783 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at their stories.

00:27:12.783 --> 00:27:13.700 align:middle line:90%
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:10%
>> When I was a
senior in high school,

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.220 align:middle line:10%
my boyfriend at the time, we
were in a really horrible car

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.800 align:middle line:10%
accident that left him with
a traumatic brain injury

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:10%
so severe that the only thing
he could do was blink his eyes--

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.810 align:middle line:10%
one long blink for "no" and
lots of blinks for "yes."

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:34.660 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most traumatic
experiences I had in my life

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.220 align:middle line:10%
was going to the hospital
to see my sister.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:10%
I had no idea what
happened to her,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.480 align:middle line:10%
but I know she was attacked.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.520 align:middle line:10%
A few days later, I was
out getting groceries

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:10%
and on my way home, I
seen a cop car parked

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:10%
on the street in
front of my house.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And he informs me that they
had arrested my husband

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.620 align:middle line:84%
for sexually
assaulting my sister.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a really difficult,
the most difficult experience

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I've ever had in my life, to
see somebody suffering so much

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and not being able, no matter
how hard or what my intention

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
was, to take away his
pain or to heal him.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I knew that I
had to be in charge,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that I had to do
something to keep my family

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
safe and keep my family together
and figure out what I'm going

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:20.410 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:22.960 align:middle line:84%
And an answer
came, and I decided

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:90%
I was staying with my husband.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:29.590 align:middle line:84%
>> After the seven years, I
really wanted to get married

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.910 align:middle line:90%
and have children.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.810 align:middle line:84%
And I met my
husband, and I am not

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
surprised that at
32 years old, I

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.420 align:middle line:84%
woke up with a one-year-old
and three-year-old and breast

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I stayed home as a
stay-at-home mom for over 20

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.970 align:middle line:84%
years, making sure that my
kids had some type of an anchor

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.150 align:middle line:84%
of safety and support
from my presence,

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:84%
even though I had a great
deal to deal with during those

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.470 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking back, I know
that what had happened

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to my physical body was that
the emotions that I had stuffed

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:09.820 align:middle line:84%
deep down for so long, the
feeling of guilt for surviving,

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.150 align:middle line:84%
the feeling of shame for walking
on and deciding that I wanted

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.430 align:middle line:90%
to live my own life.

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I was having a recurring
issue with rages behind closed

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.290 align:middle line:90%
doors in my marriage.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with PTSD,
and then I started counseling.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And I knew that I
was desperate to heal.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.880 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to heal.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that there
had to be another way.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I
reached out and googled

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.520 align:middle line:90%
and searched how to heal.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:84%
And I came across
Deborah King's program.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember hearing Deborah
King on "Hay House Radio"

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and I listened to her
perspective on healing.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And I just started to
devour every course

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.040 align:middle line:90%
and every workshop.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.960 align:middle line:90%
>> She has this really--

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.210 align:middle line:84%
just this program of healing
that really, really works.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, through
Deborah King's program,

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I was able to speak my
truth about the trauma,

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:84%
and it's just completely
changed my life.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> I was able to reclaim
my sense of power.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I was able to be
joyful without guilt.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I was able to love
myself and give love

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:90%
in a much more balanced way.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.080 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing, Deborah.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I have some very
gifted graduate students.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.305 align:middle line:84%
>> You've been such a catalyst
for so many amazing healing

00:30:27.305 --> 00:30:28.105 align:middle line:90%
journeys.

00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:30.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but they do all
the hard work, you know?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.840 align:middle line:84%
They do the heavy lifting,
and I'm just the midwife.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we have one
of Deborah's students,

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.080 align:middle line:84%
who is now a healer
herself, with us today--

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Cathy Gabrielson.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Cathy.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'm so happy to be here.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you share with
us, specifically,

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.820 align:middle line:84%
what tools Deborah
has taught you?

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The tools came their way
to me when I needed them.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.130 align:middle line:10%
So particular things would come.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.480 align:middle line:84%
For instance, she has this
technique, or at least

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.110 align:middle line:84%
that's how I describe
it, as this journaling,

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.960 align:middle line:84%
meditating, connecting
with nature,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:90%
forgiving, and letting go.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.130 align:middle line:84%
And it was really--
what it enabled me

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.550 align:middle line:90%
to do was figure out who I was.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Because I was so wounded,
and part of my wounds were I

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.340 align:middle line:84%
just didn't know who
I was or how I felt.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.150 align:middle line:84%
So when I started to study under
Deborah and do her programs,

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I really, just piece by piece,
just beginning with journaling

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.230 align:middle line:84%
or meditating, I
just was becoming

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:33.820 align:middle line:84%
to know a little bit
more about myself

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:90%
so that I actually could heal.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.190 align:middle line:90%
So it was a process.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.990 align:middle line:90%
It was a process.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.930 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a symphony of things
that we have to draw together

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.230 align:middle line:84%
and start to
animate differently.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wanted to follow
up with something.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Years later, you developed
sepsis and almost died.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share a little
bit about what happened there?

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.900 align:middle line:90%
What was going on?

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I think by the time
the sepsis actually came,

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I think I had just been
filled with so much trauma,

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
so much pent up emotion that I
didn't even realize was stored

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:90%
in my body.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And that time, I was just away
on vacation with my family.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.347 align:middle line:84%
And it was actually seven
years after my breast cancer.

00:32:14.347 --> 00:32:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was on a beach
chair and then ended up

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.730 align:middle line:84%
with a massive
infection in my implant

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.220 align:middle line:84%
and ended up having
to have that emergency

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.860 align:middle line:90%
surgery to have it removed.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind
of the last bit

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.700 align:middle line:90%
that I think my body could take.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I knew when I was in
the hospital with sepsis

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:37.120 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't think I had any
more strength within me to do

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.230 align:middle line:90%
any more.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And I actually felt like I had
served enough and done enough.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.540 align:middle line:84%
And it would be OK
if I actually left.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But sure enough, I
came back, and I was--

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.220 align:middle line:84%
that's when I was the
most broken, I think.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I
told my husband, I said,

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.140 align:middle line:90%
I think I'm going down.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.093 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know who's
going to pick me up.

00:32:56.093 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting that I
said that, because in the end,

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.260 align:middle line:84%
no one would have been
able to pick me up.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.080 align:middle line:84%
I had to learn the
tools, like Deborah

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.960 align:middle line:84%
said, to do the work
ourselves to pick myself up,

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:84%
so that I could move on and be
who I need to be in this world.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, sometimes when it seems
there's no one there for us,

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.680 align:middle line:84%
it's because we're supposed
to recognize that we are more

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.103 align:middle line:84%
empowered than we
thought we were.

00:33:17.103 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
you had the tools

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:22.450 align:middle line:84%
to work with to be able to
translate that into a success.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:27.295 align:middle line:84%
Was there a relationship there
between your heart chakra

00:33:27.295 --> 00:33:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and your second
round of healing?

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.730 align:middle line:90%
And what was that relationship?

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Even though you
were cancer free,

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.570 align:middle line:84%
what do you feel
was still happening

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:41.830 align:middle line:84%
there that needed to unfold
for you to be completely whole

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:42.850 align:middle line:90%
and well?

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It was really, over the
course of all the years,

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:84%
it was the storing of the
emotions would just take bit

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:90%
by bit away from me.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And my heart was most
affected, because in all of it,

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I just hadn't forgiven
myself for being sick

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.670 align:middle line:90%
and for affecting other people.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my role, I
thought, in this world

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.360 align:middle line:90%
was to serve other people.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And here I am
constantly being sick

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and creating these
situations that

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.239 align:middle line:90%
impose on somebody else's life.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And then that was
like a double whammy.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:84%
You know, my heart
hurt even more.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you speak to us a little
bit about forgiveness on any

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:84%
level, self-forgiveness,
forgiveness of circumstances?

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.699 align:middle line:84%
I think this is such
a valuable aspect

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:29.440 align:middle line:84%
of what we have as a capacity
for self-healing to do.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Can you just speak
to our audience

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:35.199 align:middle line:84%
about the role of self-care
and self-forgiveness?

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.929 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a really
good thing to share.

00:34:37.929 --> 00:34:41.270 align:middle line:84%
forgiveness wasn't about
forgiving other people,

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.070 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.800 align:middle line:84%
It was about forgiving and
letting go the situation

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.000 align:middle line:84%
and what I was
carrying with it in me.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:84%
Kind of setting
ourselves free inside

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.150 align:middle line:90%
to allow the healing to happen.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Deborah, what was it
like to work with Cathy?

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, Cathy is just
stunning to work with,

00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and she's raised a couple
of things that are really

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.870 align:middle line:90%
important here.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.230 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest blocks
to moving an individual up

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:13.430 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, which is
really what I most excel at,

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.280 align:middle line:84%
is their inability to
forgive themselves.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.660 align:middle line:90%
It's just like this weight.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can see it.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I can sense it, and it
just gets in the way.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the main things

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I do is help people
pass that hurdle.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
thing I want to mention,

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and I'm sure Cathy
would back this up,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.650 align:middle line:84%
is that we work often with
people who are in no state,

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.750 align:middle line:90%
ready to be self-empowered.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to actually
step in and help them.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of clients
and students, who--

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.480 align:middle line:90%
they're pretty desperate.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.790 align:middle line:90%
And I understand that.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.590 align:middle line:90%
I've been there.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.970 align:middle line:90%
I know what that feels like.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:55.670 align:middle line:90%
So does Cathy.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And so we meet
them at that level

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and produce our own
energy that we're

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.440 align:middle line:84%
pulling from the
source beyond ourselves

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.890 align:middle line:90%
to transmit to this person.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about attracting,
conducting, and transmitting

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:13.960 align:middle line:84%
universal energy, the
God force, to someone

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:90%
who really, really needs it.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And then later, you
get them on their feet

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and start talking
about self-empowerment,

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.990 align:middle line:90%
but you don't start there.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.970 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
start looking at them

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.470 align:middle line:84%
pretty hard to see
if I can get them

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:27.928 align:middle line:84%
to self-forgiveness,
which is often

00:36:27.928 --> 00:36:29.560 align:middle line:90%
the cause of the whole problem.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.430 align:middle line:90%
We blame ourselves.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.658 align:middle line:84%
>> A rejection of
ourself in the world.

00:36:32.658 --> 00:36:34.450 align:middle line:84%
There's something not
right, and it must be

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.500 align:middle line:90%
me, that kind of disposition.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.980 align:middle line:84%
So Cathy, you have
obviously awakened

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.250 align:middle line:84%
to more and more and
more of your true self

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and are building the circuitry
to sustain that in your life.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're so grateful for you
sharing your experience with us

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:57.460 align:middle line:84%
today, because there are many,
many people out there that

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.610 align:middle line:84%
need to know that
this is possible,

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.200 align:middle line:90%
and you're making that easy.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for being with us today.

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:04.770 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:05.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank Deborah.

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, fun seeing you.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:90%
- Bye-bye.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:12.213 align:middle line:84%
So why do so many women
develop breast cancer?

00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:14.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, other than
the environmental causation,

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:17.560 align:middle line:84%
which is getting more
and more significant,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.100 align:middle line:84%
the most common issue I
see is we take on too much

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.540 align:middle line:90%
responsibility.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.210 align:middle line:84%
You know I'm going to
be the perfect mother,

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:30.190 align:middle line:84%
the perfect employee, the
perfect volunteer, and then

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:middle line:84%
the next thing you know,
boom, you kind of collapse.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's a weight
on the shoulders

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:39.250 align:middle line:84%
and the shoulders are
adjacent to the breasts.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's just too much.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:45.070 align:middle line:84%
It's just too much, too
much for the whole system.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.990 align:middle line:84%
>> We're taking on energies
that are not our authentic self.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:84%
If we're trying to be the
best this and the best that,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.760 align:middle line:84%
we're in constant
state of comparison.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're shutting down
our own authenticity.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Our true, heartfelt
version of life

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.690 align:middle line:84%
doesn't get to
have a life at all.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:84%
So these energies
get suppressed,

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:08.350 align:middle line:84%
and heart chakra-related,
as you're sharing.

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but I don't want
to oversimplify the way

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.580 align:middle line:84%
the chakras work,
because, of course,

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.070 align:middle line:84%
it can be a problem
with an adjacent chakra.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.860 align:middle line:84%
It isn't necessarily right where
the affected disease process

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> A confluence of energies
that are from our whole system

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:28.570 align:middle line:84%
at this layer of our being that
is either operating in unison

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and in integration or it's not.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And when it's not, it can
show up in so many ways.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you also
work with chelation.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:90%
Can you--

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Chelation is a kind
of an old-fashioned,

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I call it Energy Healing
101 sort of a technique.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.470 align:middle line:84%
I teach it because I like to
teach students every aspect,

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:53.290 align:middle line:84%
so they get a broad
spectrum of techniques.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, you're clearing,
charging, and balancing

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.990 align:middle line:90%
each chakra in sequence.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.260 align:middle line:90%
It just has a fancy name.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with our
viewers just a little bit

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:05.590 align:middle line:84%
about what chelation therapy
is, because many may not

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.540 align:middle line:90%
have been exposed to that?

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, again, it's the
practitioner using universal

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.660 align:middle line:84%
energy coming through themselves
and then their hands to clear,

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.630 align:middle line:84%
charge, and balance each chakra
in sequence from the bottom

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:21.430 align:middle line:90%
to the top.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So and there are other forms
of chelation therapy that are--

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Unrelated

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> --unrelated-- intravenous
expression of high doses

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin therapies and those
kinds of cleansing agents

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.210 align:middle line:90%
through the body.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:90%
So I just wanted to--

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.873 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you can always
spot the difference,

00:39:36.873 --> 00:39:38.620 align:middle line:84%
because in that
kind of chelation,

00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.410 align:middle line:84%
you're in a lounge chair
with a needle in your arm.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you definitely
know something different is

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.750 align:middle line:90%
happening right here.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:46.120 align:middle line:90%
It involves needles.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>> That is not energy healing.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It might be very
healing, though.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.485 align:middle line:84%
>> That will not slip
by your-- you will know

00:39:52.485 --> 00:39:54.370 align:middle line:90%
if that's what's happening.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:59.260 align:middle line:84%
So you've also mentioned
characterology.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.210 align:middle line:84%
One of your students
spoke about this.

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Could you just say a
little bit about that?

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I love to teach it.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It's in the psychology
field, actually.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.010 align:middle line:84%
But I teach it early
on in my program

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:13.690 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's so
helpful to just everyone.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's a really interesting
field that resurfaced in the US

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.360 align:middle line:90%
and in the West in the '50s.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.180 align:middle line:84%
But I tracked it all the
way back to the Vetas which

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.420 align:middle line:84%
is my field of expertise,
and then I saw it again

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:90%
in the Greeks and the Romans.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.340 align:middle line:90%
They knew about it.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:35.410 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's being able
to look at someone's body type,

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.980 align:middle line:84%
their body as an
adult, and figure out

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:44.140 align:middle line:84%
what defenses they used before
they were seven years old,

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.720 align:middle line:84%
and hence, their body looks the
way it does now as an adult.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we're kids, starting
when we're in the womb,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:58.715 align:middle line:84%
we are exposed to unpleasant
events, and we go into defense.

00:40:58.715 --> 00:41:01.930 align:middle line:84%
We decide to be someone we're
not to protect ourselves.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.240 align:middle line:84%
So these defenses
are not who you are.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.100 align:middle line:90%
They are who you are not.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.240 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so
interesting about them.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.830 align:middle line:84%
And the first one that
develops and, again,

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.620 align:middle line:84%
in the womb or right at
birth, due to a trauma

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:19.990 align:middle line:84%
like your mother is
having a difficult birth,

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.720 align:middle line:84%
there is some kind
of crisis going on

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.940 align:middle line:84%
in utero or at the birth,
like maybe a flood or a fire

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.250 align:middle line:84%
or an earthquake or a
war, something that's

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:84%
throwing the mother
totally out of balance,

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.950 align:middle line:90%
and hence, you, the infant.

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you remember
where you came from,

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.020 align:middle line:84%
because you just came from
there a few months before.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It hasn't been so long.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It hasn't been that long.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you know how
to go back there.

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:45.980 align:middle line:90%
So you go, I'm out of here.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And you go right up out
of your crown chakra,

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.520 align:middle line:84%
your consciousness, and
zoom back somewhere else,

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:90%
where you are unsafe.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:84%
And so you continue this
feeling of lack of safety.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.600 align:middle line:84%
You exaggerate it now by
not being present at all.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.280 align:middle line:90%
So the names of--

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.265 align:middle line:90%


00:42:06.265 --> 00:42:07.530 align:middle line:90%
they're states of mind.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And these defenses are taken
from the psychology world,

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.270 align:middle line:90%
so they're confusing.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:90%
So don't be offended.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:16.080 align:middle line:84%
They call that schizoid,
that first type.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.070 align:middle line:84%
But it just means that you've
spun out and you've split.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.290 align:middle line:90%
And those people tend to look--

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:84%
I can't do it
anymore, but I used

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.380 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do it really well.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.890 align:middle line:90%
They tend to have weak joints.

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:28.530 align:middle line:90%
They're hyperextensive.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.080 align:middle line:90%
They usually can pop joints.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.850 align:middle line:90%
They are elongated.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Their body's kind of elongating,
kind of airy looking.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
within, either in utero

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.100 align:middle line:90%
or within two weeks of birth.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.680 align:middle line:84%
The next one, the next
defense that you can develop

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.280 align:middle line:84%
is if you're deprived
in some way of what

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.300 align:middle line:90%
you think of nurturance.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:55.200 align:middle line:84%
It could be you're not nursed
enough or not often enough

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.570 align:middle line:84%
or on the wrong
schedule or somehow

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.880 align:middle line:90%
feel abandoned or rejected.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.170 align:middle line:84%
You know, maybe the
mother or other caregiver

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.570 align:middle line:90%
just isn't tuned into you.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's that
time of those days

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:13.720 align:middle line:84%
where they said keep the infant
down the hall in the crib.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Cry it out

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Let him cry, yeah,
something like that.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And those people typically end
up with very pleading eyes.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.220 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.540 align:middle line:84%
They're one of the easiest
to see as an adult.

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a wanting.

00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>> A very wanting look.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, please, fill me.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:32.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm not full.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm here.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.010 align:middle line:90%
Help.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:38.940 align:middle line:84%
>> While the first type's
message is it's not safe here.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.690 align:middle line:84%
The second one is screaming
there's not enough for me.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.620 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough for me.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:47.050 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to admit
it, to being it.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:84%
But the third type-- third
type's very popular, especially

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:90%
with men.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.715 align:middle line:84%
They love to stand
up and tell you

00:43:52.715 --> 00:43:54.275 align:middle line:84%
that they're the
psychopath, which

00:43:54.275 --> 00:43:55.650 align:middle line:84%
is the third type,
which develops

00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:57.510 align:middle line:90%
around the age of three to five.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And that type develops when
the parent of the opposite sex

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.130 align:middle line:90%
betrays you.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:03.780 align:middle line:90%
And this happens to kids.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.958 align:middle line:90%
We just forget.

00:44:04.958 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But the little girl thought
she was Daddy's girl,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.292 align:middle line:90%
and she was going to marry him.

00:44:08.292 --> 00:44:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And then she finds out, no,
he's going to stay with Mother.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.437 align:middle line:90%
The little boy thought he was--

00:44:14.437 --> 00:44:15.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Momma's favorite.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:18.950 align:middle line:84%
>> --Momma's favorite, and then
Momma has another baby or does

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:19.750 align:middle line:90%
something else.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.510 align:middle line:90%
And so he feels very rejected.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And that defense, they get
a puffed-up upper body.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And you know kind of a--

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.860 align:middle line:90%
man or woman.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.370 align:middle line:90%
A big chest look.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:34.660 align:middle line:84%
They look very, very
depleted in their lower legs.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Their message is it's
my way or the highway.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.900 align:middle line:90%
Kill or be killed--

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:90%
that's their favorite saying.

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:90%
And look out, look out.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, these
defenses only arise--

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.820 align:middle line:84%
most people don't live
in them in adulthood.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.170 align:middle line:84%
I could name some politicians
who do, but it's not common.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.312 align:middle line:84%
Most of us flit in
and out of them.

00:44:56.312 --> 00:44:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is if you

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.710 align:middle line:84%
become aware you're doing
it and just laugh about it,

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:02.530 align:middle line:90%
you should find it humorous.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.640 align:middle line:84%
That, oh, my god, there I
am again, kill or be killed,

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.440 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.338 align:middle line:84%
>> In an unconscious
kind of way.

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, become conscious
of it, you can get rid of it.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it just starts
to dissolve into you.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.485 align:middle line:84%
>> Interesting thing--
it can just disappear,

00:45:14.485 --> 00:45:16.400 align:middle line:90%
and your body shape will change.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so interesting
is I actually see people

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:middle line:90%
becoming less--

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.110 align:middle line:84%
more of themselves, more
authentic, and less looking

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:25.790 align:middle line:90%
like that body type.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:29.855 align:middle line:84%
Even after, in their 40s or 50s,
when it's pretty well-formed.

00:45:29.855 --> 00:45:31.480 align:middle line:84%
I'll go all the way
to the end, though.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's the third
type, the upper chest.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.350 align:middle line:84%
There are
disadvantages to acting

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:40.280 align:middle line:84%
in this inauthentic way, because
it affects us physically.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.880 align:middle line:84%
So if you're scooting
out of your consciousness

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.740 align:middle line:84%
all the time, you're more
likely to have accidents.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the first one.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're pleading
for help all the time,

00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:54.920 align:middle line:84%
that type is very
inclined toward diabetes.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.100 align:middle line:84%
The third type, the
psychopath, is very inclined

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.600 align:middle line:84%
to cardiovascular
events, heart problems.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.320 align:middle line:84%
The fourth type is the hardest
to spot, the masochist--

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.600 align:middle line:84%
they're very hard to see, but
they have a compressed look--

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.600 align:middle line:84%
usually short neck,
compressed upper body.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.490 align:middle line:90%
They just look very compact.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.650 align:middle line:84%
That's also around
the age of five,

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:22.040 align:middle line:84%
when the parent
won't allow autonomy.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.360 align:middle line:90%
You have to eat what I say.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:25.580 align:middle line:84%
You have to, every
moment, do as I say.

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.630 align:middle line:84%
That child feels
explosive but contains it

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.850 align:middle line:90%
and hence, looks kind of--

00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Like they're holding in.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, no they have the
top-down look, and again,

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:39.620 align:middle line:90%
unhealthy, inauthentic.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not who they are.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And they usually will react
by having a moment of rage.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And then the last time, my
personal fave, is your rigid.

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.122 align:middle line:90%
They always look great.

00:46:54.122 --> 00:46:55.080 align:middle line:90%
They always look great.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:90%
They have no clue how they feel.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They've divorced
themselves early on,

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.100 align:middle line:84%
usually before the
age of six or seven,

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.600 align:middle line:84%
when they were told to be an
adult. You know, Daddy died.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.518 align:middle line:84%
A little boy's been
told, be a man now.

00:47:09.518 --> 00:47:11.310 align:middle line:84%
He has to put away the
things of the child.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.810 align:middle line:90%
How unfair.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And so his reaction will be
to take his true feelings

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and completely divorce
himself from them

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and become this
perfect individual.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're very inclined
toward cardiovascular events,

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:30.875 align:middle line:84%
because they're so lonely
because they're so not in touch

00:47:30.875 --> 00:47:31.675 align:middle line:90%
with themselves.

00:47:31.675 --> 00:47:32.380 align:middle line:90%
>> They're not in the body.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.505 align:middle line:90%
>> But they look wonderful.

00:47:33.505 --> 00:47:35.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they're
not in the body.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:37.750 align:middle line:90%
They're just running the show.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:44.050 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a really
fun way to teach.

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.760 align:middle line:10%
It's very interactive,
and people really

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.540 align:middle line:10%
get a lot out of it.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.380 align:middle line:10%
They see themselves.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.170 align:middle line:84%
They see their significant
other, their mother-in-law.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.020 align:middle line:90%
They see everybody.

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And then you learn how better
to manage a relationship.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Because like, for
example, if you're

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:03.451 align:middle line:84%
dealing with someone who is
inclined to kill or be killed,

00:48:03.451 --> 00:48:06.580 align:middle line:84%
if they are pushed,
then don't push.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.550 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't push
that individual.

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:13.047 align:middle line:84%
>> And it also, for me, it
allows us to understand someone

00:48:13.047 --> 00:48:15.130 align:middle line:84%
has an operating system
that they're plugged into.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:18.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a defense mechanism
only because they're trying

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:19.990 align:middle line:90%
to survive something still.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So it allows compassion
to kind of roll

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.240 align:middle line:84%
into a scenario, where you
might previously have gotten

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.590 align:middle line:90%
offended by a way of being.

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:27.820 align:middle line:84%
You realize, oh, my
god, they're just

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.280 align:middle line:84%
doing that because they're not
in touch with who they really

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:30.550 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.800 align:middle line:84%
They're not in touch
with their true source.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And it allows us to remain
open and available as a healing

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.350 align:middle line:84%
presence instead of
being reactive to it

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.690 align:middle line:90%
and furthering it, you know?

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So where can people learn more
about what you have to share?

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, just drop
by deborahking.com.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Deborahking.com.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.840 align:middle line:10%
Fabulous.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:54.550 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much for sharing
your amazing information,

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.400 align:middle line:10%
your collection of wisdom
over your lifetime,

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.800 align:middle line:10%
and for being
intimate and sharing

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.300 align:middle line:10%
your deep personal process--

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.880 align:middle line:84%
>> --of how you came
to be all that you are.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.120 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I have great respect
for the work that we do.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.035 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that those of
you that are watching this

00:49:13.035 --> 00:49:15.940 align:middle line:84%
can understand the power
of energy medicine.

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.220 align:middle line:10%
As we begin to understand
the chakra system,

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:21.340 align:middle line:10%
we can see how our unresolved
traumas and emotions

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.440 align:middle line:10%
cause dysfunction.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.150 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
"Healing Matrix."

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:32.000 align:middle line:90%
