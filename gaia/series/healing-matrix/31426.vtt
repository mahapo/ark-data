[ Music ]

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:25.392 align:middle line:84%
We got into a lot of
very controversial things

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:28.461 align:middle line:84%
in our last talk including
the subject of transhumanism

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.431 align:middle line:84%
and maybe just do a quick recap
and the reason I ask you to do

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.199 align:middle line:90%
that is because we're talking

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
about things people really are
overwhelmed by oftentimes want

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.439 align:middle line:84%
to avoid and maybe just
don't want to go to the time

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.108 align:middle line:84%
and trouble of reading all
the labels but it's imperative

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:45.078 align:middle line:84%
that we understand the GMO story
so just recap what we talked

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.714 align:middle line:84%
about before and then we're
going to look at all the ways

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.583 align:middle line:84%
in which we can kind of
cleanse our bodies free

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.818 align:middle line:84%
of all these things that
we've been exposed to.

00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:53.953 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Definitely.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.522 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about GMOs,
where they're headed.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.691 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the studies
that have shown that the Round

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:01.194 align:middle line:84%
Up used in Round Up ready
crops that are being --

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:02.829 align:middle line:84%
that's being produced
in our stomachs

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.764 align:middle line:84%
when we eat these crops
has been linked to 34 --

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:09.401 align:middle line:84%
28 to 34 different associated
diseases from DNA damage

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.137 align:middle line:84%
and cancer and lymphoma
and etc.,

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.206 align:middle line:90%
etc. and where it's heading.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.675 align:middle line:84%
We talked about how not
only are they looking

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:19.446 align:middle line:84%
to genetically modify crops and
organisms now in the food supply

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.182 align:middle line:84%
but in the very near future
they're looking to modify

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.216 align:middle line:84%
and they're already
doing so in some cases,

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
our very genetic nature of
humanity and they're talking

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.924 align:middle line:84%
about creating these artificial
bodies and everything like that

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:35.195 align:middle line:84%
to where the entire humanity
process is cancelled out

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.764 align:middle line:84%
and they substitute it
for genetic modification.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.733 align:middle line:84%
So it's important now
that we signal out GMOs

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
in our daily diet,
completely avoid them

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.673 align:middle line:84%
and do not fund Monsanto
and other major corporations

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.642 align:middle line:84%
that are supporting GMOs so we
can prevent them in the future.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.444 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Absolutely and we also --

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:52.879 align:middle line:84%
we ended with talking
about the fact

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.582 align:middle line:84%
that one way you can be
proactive is certainly go

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:56.782 align:middle line:90%
with organic.

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:58.685 align:middle line:84%
Locally produced
organic ideally,

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:90%
support your local farmers.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.456 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go to the
trouble go even a step further

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.391 align:middle line:84%
and have a little
backyard garden.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.927 align:middle line:84%
There are ways we can
inexpensively have control

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.128 align:middle line:90%
over our food sources.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.531 align:middle line:84%
Nothing for a packet of
seeds and little tending,

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:13.833 align:middle line:84%
little water, pull a
couple weeds now and then

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.702 align:middle line:84%
and you've got really
good food --

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Or even aquaponics.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: -- depending
on what you're going to buy.

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:19.305 align:middle line:90%
Or aquaponics.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Yes. A whole other
subject that's fascinating.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.542 align:middle line:84%
If you can go the
distance aquaponics.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.911 align:middle line:90%
So those are some of the things.

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:26.312 align:middle line:90%
Now there are also a lot

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.849 align:middle line:84%
of really inexpensive things we
can do just by way of knowledge.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.986 align:middle line:84%
We can even use water
as a means to heal a lot

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%
of what's going on in the body.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.422 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
that part of the story.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.292 align:middle line:84%
You're really big, first
thing in the morning,

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.327 align:middle line:84%
using water as your
greatest ally.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:42.161 align:middle line:90%
Let's start there.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Exactly.

00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So the quality of water
that you're getting

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.233 align:middle line:84%
on a daily basis will
determine how you feel.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.703 align:middle line:84%
Period. I mean if you're taking
in poor quality tap water,

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.005 align:middle line:90%
you're going to feel bad.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.307 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel
sluggish because your body --

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
think about it as
fuel for a vehicle.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.879 align:middle line:84%
If you're putting rocks into
your gas tank with a little bit

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.749 align:middle line:84%
of fuel itself, you
can maybe get somewhere

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.316 align:middle line:84%
but your car is going
to blow up eventually.

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:08.121 align:middle line:84%
So what I like to advocate is
get really high quality purified

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
water in the morning whether
it's through reverse osmosis

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.826 align:middle line:84%
and if that's the case you do
need to restore some minerals --

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:15.962 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- to
the water which can be done --

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:18.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
through Himalayan sea salt

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.332 align:middle line:84%
or apple cider vinegar,
something like that.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.667 align:middle line:84%
But in the very beginning
of your morning,

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.636 align:middle line:84%
even before you brush your
teeth, one of the coolest tricks

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.638 align:middle line:84%
that you can do -- and not
a lot of people know this --

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.473 align:middle line:84%
is to heat up some
purified water.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:28.408 align:middle line:90%
Just heat it up on the stove.

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:29.342 align:middle line:90%
Don't use the microwave.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:29.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.044 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Just heat up on the stove

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:34.347 align:middle line:84%
to about a lukewarm to a
slightly hot temperature.

00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:38.284 align:middle line:84%
Put it in about an 8-ounce glass
and squeeze an entire lemon

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.520 align:middle line:84%
in there and then put
a slice of the lemon

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.689 align:middle line:90%
in the water and sip it.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.391 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening now is
not only are you speeding

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.393 align:middle line:84%
up your digestion for
the rest of the day,

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:50.163 align:middle line:84%
enhancing your mental clarity,
enhancing the liver function --

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.599 align:middle line:84%
as we know the compounds
in lemon mixed

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.301 align:middle line:84%
with this amazing
purified water are doing,

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.503 align:middle line:84%
but you're also going
ahead and making sure

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:58.838 align:middle line:90%
that the first thing you get

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:02.108 align:middle line:84%
in your body is something
that's nutritionally powerful

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:03.509 align:middle line:90%
and healing.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.845 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen amazing effects
with people who are suffering

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.213 align:middle line:84%
from disease or even
those who are obese --

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:09.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
and want to lose weight.

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:11.184 align:middle line:90%
This is one of the best tips.

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.652 align:middle line:84%
I tell it to everybody
who emails me,

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:13.987 align:middle line:90%
saying how do I lose weight?

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:16.356 align:middle line:84%
This is the best thing you
can do, warm water with lemon.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.991 align:middle line:90%
Drink it in the morning.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.393 align:middle line:84%
Take your time but
drink the entire thing.

00:04:20.393 --> 00:04:21.861 align:middle line:90%
Even two glasses if you can.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you fill it up it
will still taste like lemon.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.832 align:middle line:84%
It will still have some
lemon citrus in it.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:26.566 align:middle line:90%
Tastes delicious.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It's great.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.701 align:middle line:90%
Everybody loves it who does it.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.304 align:middle line:84%
But then the key thing is
though, you drink it and 30

00:04:31.304 --> 00:04:34.007 align:middle line:90%
to 45 minutes later, you eat.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:36.909 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to actually be
drinking this lemon water while

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.512 align:middle line:84%
eating it's still okay
but what's happening is --

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:42.949 align:middle line:84%
what people don't understand,
they drink massive amount

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.018 align:middle line:90%
of beverage with their food.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.119 align:middle line:90%
Usually a soda.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:48.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: But
the fact of the matter is

00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.523 align:middle line:84%
that when you're
drinking with your food,

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.626 align:middle line:84%
you're diluting your
digestive ability to go ahead

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:58.264 align:middle line:84%
and assimilate that food into
energy and extract the vitamins

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.599 align:middle line:90%
and nutrients from it.

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.535 align:middle line:84%
So you're fighting against
yourself and everyone I talk

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:05.571 align:middle line:84%
to they say oh is that why,
you know, I start burping

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:90%
and passing gas when I eat food?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.743 align:middle line:84%
Well yeah, it is because
your body's saying stop

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:13.646 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know what it
means so you just keep doing it

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.248 align:middle line:90%
or people will say well what

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.083 align:middle line:84%
about when I can't
swallow my food,

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.751 align:middle line:84%
I have to drink something
with it.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.353 align:middle line:84%
Well you're not chewing
your food properly.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.587 align:middle line:90%
We get into that too.

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:23.089 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing everyone
should do in the morning

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.625 align:middle line:84%
if they want to lose
wait or anything is drink

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.027 align:middle line:84%
that warm lemon water and
you'll notice the difference.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:29.896 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You know,
[laughter] as you're talking

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:33.566 align:middle line:84%
about it, I'm flashing
back to somewhere more

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:36.903 align:middle line:84%
than 20 years ago waiting
for funding on a documentary

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:39.105 align:middle line:90%
so I went to work for a friend

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.475 align:middle line:84%
at their very nice cafe
behind the counter making

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:43.643 align:middle line:90%
espresso drinks.

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:45.044 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never done
anything like this.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:47.747 align:middle line:84%
It was really kind of a fun
thing to do and meet people.

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:51.050 align:middle line:84%
So I was drinking espressos
which I had just started doing.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.186 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't done it
in my youth at all.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:57.256 align:middle line:84%
And I'd be wiped out after
about three hours having just

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.059 align:middle line:84%
like a little mocha, a little
short mocha so I switched

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.328 align:middle line:84%
over because behind
the bar was a lot of --

00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:04.097 align:middle line:84%
there were a lot of
freshly sliced lemons.

00:06:04.097 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
I switched over to exactly what
you're talking about and boom,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.135 align:middle line:90%
my mind clarified immediately.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:11.904 align:middle line:90%
So I got pretty quickly this --

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:15.842 align:middle line:84%
starting the day with the coffee
thing is not working for me

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:18.778 align:middle line:84%
but the lemon added
a mental collar --

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:22.749 align:middle line:84%
that lemon and water added an
incredible mental clarity more

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:90%
so than when I came in

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.785 align:middle line:84%
and started drinking
anything at all.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I don't drink coffee.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.056 align:middle line:84%
I don't know anybody who
follows these practices that do,

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.724 align:middle line:84%
but I will tell you if
you drink coffee right

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.559 align:middle line:84%
in the morning you're
draining yourself right away.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:34.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Absolutely.

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:36.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You're
taking away the energy

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:37.964 align:middle line:90%
that you need throughout the day

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:39.532 align:middle line:84%
and also you're draining
yourself

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.801 align:middle line:84%
through the adrenal glands
and everything like that.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:42.802 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:43.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
And of course

00:06:43.903 --> 00:06:44.771 align:middle line:84%
in many cases people
don't just drink coffee,

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:46.472 align:middle line:90%
they drink sugar with coffee.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Oh yeah
and you drink milk with coffee.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:52.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Like your
quadruple espresso laden mocha

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:52.945 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:54.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right.

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:55.148 align:middle line:84%
With all the antibiotics in
the milk and the bacteria.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:57.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
you are waking up in the day

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:00.553 align:middle line:84%
and saying hey, I'm going to
go against myself this morning

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:01.988 align:middle line:84%
if you're drinking
something like coffee.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:03.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:03.956 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
You're saying I'm going

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.091 align:middle line:90%
to start my day off negatively.

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You
start out in a deficit.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You do.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.396 align:middle line:84%
And then so many people go to
work and 12:00p.m. comes around,

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.832 align:middle line:84%
afternoon they're
head's on their desk.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:13.933 align:middle line:90%
They're ready to go to sleep.

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Got
to have another one.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:15.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Got to have another one.

00:07:15.768 --> 00:07:16.836 align:middle line:90%
Got to have a coffee.

00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:18.104 align:middle line:84%
Get home and then
it's just like oh I'm

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.472 align:middle line:90%
out for the rest of the day.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:20.773 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:21.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You
don't have to be like that.

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:22.775 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well
now let's talk about tea

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure
people listening

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.746 align:middle line:84%
to this are saying okay, well
I start my day with a cup

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:30.383 align:middle line:84%
of green tea so it's
hot, it's herbal.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:32.485 align:middle line:84%
Now what is the advantage
to having hot --

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.621 align:middle line:84%
or warm water over a glass
of say hot herbal tea?

00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Well the
first thing you need to wonder

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.625 align:middle line:90%
about is the source of your tea.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
That is true.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Is
your tea coming from China?

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Well then you might not want
to purchase that tea anymore

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.332 align:middle line:84%
because we know what's
happening in the environment

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.801 align:middle line:84%
with the cancer groups over
there in China [inaudible]

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Talk about
this a little bit in green tea.

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:51.437 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:07:51.437 --> 00:07:52.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Sure

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:56.909 align:middle line:84%
so not only does tea naturally
go ahead and take fluoride in.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.644 align:middle line:90%
Now sodium fluoride in this case

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.546 align:middle line:84%
because of the mass
contamination.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:03.115 align:middle line:84%
But China is so chemically
polluted

00:08:03.115 --> 00:08:06.085 align:middle line:84%
that there are cancer clusters,
villages that are dying

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:09.789 align:middle line:84%
of cancer and it's
naive to think

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:12.792 align:middle line:84%
that this chemical pollution
doesn't extend to the crops

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:15.628 align:middle line:84%
and plants and everything
that are being grown in China

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:18.731 align:middle line:84%
so when they take out
something that has been grown

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.367 align:middle line:90%
in devastated environmentally --

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:22.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:23.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.937 align:middle line:84%
polluted areas in acreage
that is just decimated

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and not only do they do that,
but they package it improperly

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.442 align:middle line:84%
and it's been contaminated
with heavy metals,

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:30.843 align:middle line:84%
Then you have something
being shipped

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.246 align:middle line:84%
over to the United States and
you -- some people actually look

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:36.315 align:middle line:84%
and they say I only want the tea
from China because, you know,

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:39.619 align:middle line:84%
that's technically considered
to be the best place to get it.

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.553 align:middle line:90%
You don't want that.

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.722 align:middle line:84%
And then Japan is
another concern.

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:46.325 align:middle line:84%
So Japan the Fukushima incident
has really such a massive amount

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:49.195 align:middle line:84%
of radiation into the Pacific
Ocean specifically and Japan

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:53.466 align:middle line:84%
at large that I actually
advocate purchasing your tea

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:56.168 align:middle line:84%
from the United States
or local if possible.

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:58.304 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first thing to
consider but definitely tea

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.972 align:middle line:84%
in the morning is
actually a good thing

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.275 align:middle line:90%
because it's not cold.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:04.377 align:middle line:84%
People wake up in the morning
and they have a cold juice

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:06.479 align:middle line:90%
of orange juice -- cold glass

00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:08.281 align:middle line:84%
of orange juice they're
actually going

00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.416 align:middle line:84%
against themselves
in that capacity too.

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:12.685 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda speaks specifically
to this.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:13.819 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Yes, it does.

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:14.854 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: In
a very large capacity.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.156 align:middle line:84%
It's compared to
putting out the fire

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:19.025 align:middle line:84%
of your digestion
and it's very true.

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.227 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Your putting out the fire.

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.061 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up
you're fueling the fire

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.195 align:middle line:90%
with that hot water and lemon.

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.464 align:middle line:84%
It's burning hotter so
you can put food in it

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and you'll just -- you
know, power it up --

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:30.937 align:middle line:84%
but when you drink that cold
orange juice in the morning

00:09:30.937 --> 00:09:34.507 align:middle line:84%
or even cold freshly squeezed
juice or freshly juiced stuff

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.542 align:middle line:84%
in the morning you're
putting out that fire.

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:38.945 align:middle line:84%
That's why, for example, this
morning I had watermelon juice

00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
which I've been doing recently
because I think it's great

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.781 align:middle line:90%
to hydrate yourself --

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:43.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- in
that way, in that capacity

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:90%
after my warm water with lemon.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:09:46.052 --> 00:09:47.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: But
I keep the melons out.

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:48.120 align:middle line:90%
I don't put them in the

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.121 align:middle line:84%
fridge. I try not
to put anything

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.256 align:middle line:84%
in the fridge unless
you have to.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.425 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's EMF
concerns with that anyway

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.128 align:middle line:84%
but the melon is actually
lukewarm from being out.

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.364 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
I cut it up and I drink it

00:09:58.364 --> 00:09:59.332 align:middle line:84%
and it's just like
drinking warm water.

00:09:59.332 --> 00:10:00.533 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:01.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
it's a substitute as well.

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:02.835 align:middle line:84%
So always try and get that
warm water and remember

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.737 align:middle line:84%
to separate it between
meals for 45 minutes

00:10:04.737 --> 00:10:06.639 align:middle line:84%
and you will notice
amazing difference.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:07.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Absolutely.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.776 align:middle line:84%
And so tea's fine but look
at your sourcing on the tea.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:11.544 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:12.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:10:12.945 --> 00:10:14.714 align:middle line:84%
Okay. And with that substitute
would you suggest people still

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:15.514 align:middle line:90%
put some lemon in their tea?

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:16.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:17.216 align:middle line:90%
That'd be great.

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Or
go without the lemon?

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.884 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I mean --

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:19.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Either way?

00:10:19.852 --> 00:10:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Either way.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:21.921 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You can
still get that nice warm water

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:22.755 align:middle line:90%
to activate digestion.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:23.823 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I mean,

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
I would put the lemon
in there for sure.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:27.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I mean
that's definitely optimal.

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:28.127 align:middle line:84%
I mean it increases liver
function dramatically.

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.895 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
concerning things

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:32.798 align:middle line:84%
about our modern diet is
it destroys the liver.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:33.499 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:35.568 align:middle line:84%
I mean everybody has liver
problems in some capacity.

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:36.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:38.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: If you do
a liver cleanse right now you're

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:41.607 align:middle line:84%
going to see stones come
out of toxic materials

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.743 align:middle line:84%
or even just cholesterol
that's just built up in there.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.711 align:middle line:84%
There's people getting
their gallbladders removed

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:49.315 align:middle line:84%
because they're so clustered
full of stones of buildup

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:53.219 align:middle line:84%
from all the gunk they're eating
that the liver detoxifies it

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:56.122 align:middle line:84%
and then they wonder why they
feel so sluggish during the day

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:57.890 align:middle line:90%
after they eat, you know,

00:10:57.890 --> 00:10:59.225 align:middle line:84%
what they think might
even be healthy.

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:00.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:01.694 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
mean if they have something

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.496 align:middle line:84%
in the morning like pop
tarts or something like that

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.797 align:middle line:90%
or if they have a waffles --

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:05.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:07.066 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
and they wonder, you know,

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] well, why
do they feel so bad.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.534 align:middle line:90%
It's a light meal.

00:11:08.534 --> 00:11:09.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: [laughter]

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:10.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I've had people tell me.

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:12.338 align:middle line:84%
I mean I had someone the
other day, they really wanted

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:15.408 align:middle line:84%
to lose weight and they weren't
obese but they felt so sluggish.

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.977 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know what
to do and it turns

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:19.912 align:middle line:84%
out they thought they
were eating healthy

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.113 align:middle line:84%
but they were eating
all the wrong things

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:22.548 align:middle line:90%
at all the wrong times.

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:23.949 align:middle line:90%
So for example they'd wake up

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:27.053 align:middle line:84%
and they'd have a freezing
protein shake with ice --

00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:28.054 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:11:28.054 --> 00:11:28.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
And then later

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:31.757 align:middle line:90%
in the day they might have eggs

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:33.159 align:middle line:84%
but what do you do
with your eggs?

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:37.096 align:middle line:84%
They cook it with high heat
temperatures and fry them

00:11:37.096 --> 00:11:40.232 align:middle line:84%
in olive oil, which of course
becomes rancid at high heat,

00:11:40.232 --> 00:11:42.435 align:middle line:84%
which you should use coconut
oil instead for cooking

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:43.235 align:middle line:90%
at high temperatures --

00:11:43.235 --> 00:11:44.603 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:45.938 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- or
don't cook at high temperatures.

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:47.339 align:middle line:84%
So there's many things that
can throw people for a loop

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:49.942 align:middle line:84%
when they think they're
in the healthy zone --

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:51.844 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- that they perceive.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:52.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:11:52.778 --> 00:11:54.113 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:56.549 align:middle line:84%
It's something that is very,
very seldom ever spoken of.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.385 align:middle line:84%
I mean a few years ago trans
fats became the big deal just

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:02.121 align:middle line:84%
like they're now labeling
things gluten free,

00:12:02.121 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:90%
like almonds, gluten free.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:06.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: As if
they really means anything.

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:07.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: It
doesn't mean anything.

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:08.727 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Right.

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:11.597 align:middle line:84%
It's just -- they were doing
this probably maybe five,

00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:14.066 align:middle line:84%
six years ago pretty
heavily on trans fats.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:16.268 align:middle line:90%
No trans fats.

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:19.905 align:middle line:84%
But the little known factor is
the one you just brought up.

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:23.476 align:middle line:84%
You can take a beautiful
organic cold pressed oil

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:26.479 align:middle line:84%
that you've treated with
great care and refrigerated.

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.948 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you heat that
oil especially if it goes

00:12:28.948 --> 00:12:30.282 align:middle line:90%
to smoking point no matter what

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:33.652 align:middle line:84%
that oil is you have now
created your own trans fats.

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:34.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Exactly.

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:36.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: This is
-- no one speaks about this.

00:12:36.522 --> 00:12:37.223 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Well I wrote a book.

00:12:37.223 --> 00:12:38.324 align:middle line:90%
It's free now.

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:39.391 align:middle line:84%
It's called, "The New
Health Paradigm" --

00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:40.793 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:42.695 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- about a
year ago and the main focus is,

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:46.398 align:middle line:84%
everything we know about
health has changed.

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:49.468 align:middle line:84%
Everything that has worked
for thousands of years,

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:53.105 align:middle line:84%
thanks to technology is
now a whole new system.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.573 align:middle line:84%
It's a new health
paradigm completely.

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:55.274 align:middle line:90%
We live --

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:56.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:12:56.475 --> 00:12:57.843 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
in a new health paradigm.

00:12:57.843 --> 00:13:00.212 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you're going
to the store, you see an apple.

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:02.114 align:middle line:84%
You think that's
a healthy apple.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.517 align:middle line:84%
Five hundred years ago every
apple was a healthy apple.

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:05.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:06.952 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Or even
less than that, you know,

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:08.420 align:middle line:84%
decades ago every apple
was a healthy apple.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.724 align:middle line:84%
Now that apple has not only
be sprayed with pesticides

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:15.161 align:middle line:84%
and contains sodium fluoride
type pesticides, herbicides,

00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.029 align:middle line:84%
or Monsanto's number
1 best selling --

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:17.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.766 align:middle line:84%
Round Up herbicide but
it could be months old.

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:21.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:22.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It
could be deteriorating

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:23.502 align:middle line:90%
from the inside.

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.336 align:middle line:90%
It could be rancid.

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:26.071 align:middle line:90%
It could be disgusting.

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:26.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.275 align:middle line:84%
But decades ago we didn't
have to worry about that.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:84%
We could go out and pick
it off the tree and eat it.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.679 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: But now we
live in a new health paradigm.

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.714 align:middle line:84%
Like you said, where you can
take something like olive oil

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
which is very beneficial
to the body.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:40.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
We can take it --

00:13:40.252 --> 00:13:41.921 align:middle line:84%
not only has it been sitting
in the sun in many cases

00:13:41.921 --> 00:13:44.190 align:middle line:90%
from shipping since I mean a lot

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.825 align:middle line:84%
of the trucks are
95-degrees anyway.

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:48.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
It's grown in hot areas.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:48.894 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:49.929 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.297 align:middle line:84%
But then also we put
it in a frying pan

00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:54.066 align:middle line:84%
with our handy new
stove tops that heat

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:58.103 align:middle line:84%
up to umpteenth million
degrees and it turns rancid.

00:13:58.103 --> 00:13:59.338 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It
turns into complete garbage

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that is devastating your health
and clogging your arteries.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.675 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah
and if you even heat it

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:04.777 align:middle line:90%
above I think it's above 3 --

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
325-degrees you have
created trans fats.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are
ways to deal with it.

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:13.385 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a couple of cook books a
while back vegetarian in nature

00:14:13.385 --> 00:14:15.120 align:middle line:90%
that use that method of cooking.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.023 align:middle line:84%
So where you -- as long as it's
in the presence of some kind

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:22.628 align:middle line:84%
of fluid, any kind of fluid,
you cannot overheat the oil.

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:24.430 align:middle line:84%
It's not possible to
overheat the oil if it's

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.764 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of fluid.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:28.334 align:middle line:84%
So that's just something I'm
passing on as a little hint

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.735 align:middle line:84%
if you want to cook
with a little olive oil.

00:14:29.735 --> 00:14:31.737 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times you can go
ahead and cook it and then add

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.572 align:middle line:90%
that oil back in a later.

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.207 align:middle line:90%
Again, there are very few oils

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:36.542 align:middle line:84%
that haven't been
tampered with though.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.745 align:middle line:84%
And this is big, the subject
of healthy fats in general.

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:41.447 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
detoxification.

00:14:41.447 --> 00:14:43.716 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
role of healthy fats

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:47.152 align:middle line:84%
in the detox process of the
body such as liver cleanses.

00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:48.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Everyone is afraid of fat.

00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:49.722 align:middle line:90%
They think --

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.123 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Fat phobic.

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- that if
they take in fat they become fat

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:53.859 align:middle line:90%
but it's the opposite.

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:57.896 align:middle line:84%
You should be afraid of sugars
and artificial sweeteners

00:14:57.896 --> 00:14:59.732 align:middle line:84%
that are no better,
they're way worse.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.033 align:middle line:84%
New studies are actually
confirming

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:04.703 align:middle line:84%
that 100% now even the skeptics,
the so called skeptics.

00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:06.672 align:middle line:84%
We're really the
skeptics by the way.

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:09.742 align:middle line:84%
The so called skeptics that
debate us and question,

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:12.044 align:middle line:84%
you know everything that we
possibly say out of our mouth

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:13.345 align:middle line:90%
and use it against us.

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:16.115 align:middle line:84%
They're not really skeptics
they're really worshipers

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:19.051 align:middle line:84%
of corporate phony science that
says you know buy our products.

00:15:19.051 --> 00:15:21.086 align:middle line:84%
They're perfectly fine
like aspartame etc.

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:22.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:15:22.221 --> 00:15:23.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
But the concept of fat.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Coconut oil is a great source
of cooking material as well

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.195 align:middle line:84%
as something just to
eat in your daily life.

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:32.798 align:middle line:84%
I mean look at the
Alzheimer's patients who --

00:15:32.798 --> 00:15:34.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:35.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
they go ahead and they take

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.536 align:middle line:84%
in some coconut oil and they
have their mentality come back.

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:38.370 align:middle line:90%
Almost completely --

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes 100%
just from coconut oil.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.942 align:middle line:84%
And they're probably not even
buying raw organic coconut oil.

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:46.078 align:middle line:84%
They're probably buying, you
know, garbage coconut oil.

00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:47.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:15:47.413 --> 00:15:48.714 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: The
healing power of food is immense

00:15:48.714 --> 00:15:50.182 align:middle line:84%
and something that we
should really understand is

00:15:50.182 --> 00:15:51.283 align:middle line:90%
that fat is good.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:52.351 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:53.552 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Fat keeps fat off.

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:57.056 align:middle line:84%
Fat is the -- in some
senses it has been warped

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:90%
since our diet has changed

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.026 align:middle line:84%
but it's an excellent
method of fuel for the body.

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:04.363 align:middle line:84%
We think that carbohydrates are
so excellent but I guarantee you

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:06.498 align:middle line:84%
if you sit around
eating bread all day long

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:09.435 align:middle line:84%
versus eating something,
you know, like nuts.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:10.402 align:middle line:90%
You'll notice the difference.

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And I talk to people
about that too.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.172 align:middle line:90%
They're so afraid of fat.

00:16:13.172 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: They're
afraid of fat and also

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.608 align:middle line:84%
as you said it has gotten
warped because we're been able

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:18.811 align:middle line:84%
to introduce it very
easily into our diets now

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.212 align:middle line:90%
where it wasn't so easy.

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:22.881 align:middle line:84%
In the past, if you
lived in a village

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.249 align:middle line:90%
and say your village had --

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:26.852 align:middle line:84%
grew nuts or olives and
you would take your crop

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:29.755 align:middle line:84%
to the local mill and you'd
have it milled and you'd go away

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:32.825 align:middle line:84%
with maybe a little -- half
a pint or pint size jar

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.961 align:middle line:84%
that was your share of
the village's olive oil

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:41.700 align:middle line:84%
or nut oil supply and we used
it a little more judiciously.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.269 align:middle line:84%
But what was often
available especially

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:47.539 align:middle line:84%
in the western world
in Europe was dairy.

00:16:47.539 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
So there was goat.

00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:50.743 align:middle line:84%
You could have butter
from goats.

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.544 align:middle line:84%
You could have butter
from cows, for example.

00:16:52.544 --> 00:16:53.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
All raw of course.

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: All raw.

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.047 align:middle line:84%
And now let's talk about
that because you talk

00:16:56.047 --> 00:16:59.752 align:middle line:84%
about something being demonized,
butter has been demonized,

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:03.154 align:middle line:84%
yet ghee is at the basis of
Ayurvedic medicine and so forth.

00:17:03.154 --> 00:17:04.123 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about that.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I mean go --

00:17:05.224 --> 00:17:06.191 align:middle line:84%
and I just went to the
store yesterday try

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:07.759 align:middle line:90%
to get some almonds.

00:17:07.759 --> 00:17:09.061 align:middle line:84%
They've all been
steam pasteurized.

00:17:09.061 --> 00:17:10.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Well, yeah.

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:11.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Try and get some milk.

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.531 align:middle line:84%
Try and get some milk
it's all been pasteurized.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Try and get anything and
it goes into this kind

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.939 align:middle line:84%
of nanny state idea that
nothing you get should be

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.508 align:middle line:90%
in its true form.

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:25.978 align:middle line:84%
Everything needs to be
suited properly for those

00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:27.312 align:middle line:84%
who cannot take care
of themselves.

00:17:27.312 --> 00:17:28.781 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the
medical paradigm, really.

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:29.782 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:30.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I mean the idea

00:17:30.916 --> 00:17:32.317 align:middle line:84%
that you can't make your
own decisions and decide

00:17:32.317 --> 00:17:35.854 align:middle line:84%
for yourself what to eat goes
into this pasteurization process

00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:84%
which ultimately kills
everything good inside of it --

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- and
then allows for the creation

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:43.328 align:middle line:84%
of bacteria despite, you know,
killing off bacteria originally.

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:45.230 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like your body.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.868 align:middle line:84%
I mean if we go into your
gut and pasteurize your gut,

00:17:49.868 --> 00:17:52.905 align:middle line:84%
we kill the good and the bad
bacteria like an antibiotic.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:55.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
This is a perfect example.

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:56.141 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to take
a ton of antibiotics

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.177 align:middle line:84%
which people are
doing constantly,

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
it goes into your gut, it kills
the good and the bad bacteria,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.348 align:middle line:84%
the good being probiotic
bacteria.

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:06.919 align:middle line:84%
The good bacteria of course
is fueled by healthy things

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.688 align:middle line:84%
like healthy fats
and omega-3 oils

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:13.225 align:middle line:84%
and probiotic materials
found in fermented foods

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:16.061 align:middle line:84%
but what happens is the
antibiotics kill all

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.864 align:middle line:84%
that good bacteria so your
immunity therefore is lowered

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:20.866 align:middle line:84%
completely and the bad
bacteria is allowed

00:18:20.866 --> 00:18:23.001 align:middle line:84%
to flourish even though it
killed the good and the bad,

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.536 align:middle line:84%
the bad bacteria is
allowed to flourish.

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:25.904 align:middle line:90%
The same thing is true in milk.

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:84%
When you kill off all the
good bacteria that eats

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and feeds upon the bad bacteria,
the bad bacteria will flourish.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.412 align:middle line:84%
What do you think happens
in hospitals when they wipe

00:18:33.412 --> 00:18:35.447 align:middle line:90%
down the surgery equipment

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:38.116 align:middle line:84%
with this hard core
antibacterial Triclosan agent

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:40.018 align:middle line:90%
orange styled chemicals.

00:18:40.018 --> 00:18:43.222 align:middle line:84%
They go ahead and kill
all the good bacteria

00:18:43.222 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and the bad bacteria and
they don't use something

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.091 align:middle line:90%
like colloidal silver --

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:47.459 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:48.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- which
annihilates the bad bacteria

00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:53.799 align:middle line:84%
so it goes ahead and it creates
augmented mutated bad bacteria

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
which is how we get
things like MERSA --

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Staph.

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:56.835 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- and superbugs.

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:57.269 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:18:57.269 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Um-hmm.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Same
thing's going on inside

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.105 align:middle line:90%
of your body and with milk.

00:19:00.105 --> 00:19:01.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right and so

00:19:01.106 --> 00:19:02.508 align:middle line:84%
with butter Weston
Price Foundation,

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:05.911 align:middle line:84%
they're big proponents of using
raw natural fats including raw

00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.779 align:middle line:90%
natural butter in the diet.

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:10.782 align:middle line:84%
So that is an accepted -- I
mean it doesn't always have

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.551 align:middle line:90%
to be vegan is what I'm saying.

00:19:12.551 --> 00:19:16.321 align:middle line:84%
There is a place for
everything in its raw pure form

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.556 align:middle line:90%
if you're not overindulging.

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:18.824 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Here's
a question I ask people.

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:19.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:20.792 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
This pertains to pets

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.327 align:middle line:90%
but it pertains to us as well.

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:24.796 align:middle line:90%
I feed my dog 100% raw meat --

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:25.898 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:26.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- and they say ooh,

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:27.432 align:middle line:90%
how could you do that?

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:90%
Dogs aren't meant to eat that.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.535 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
They love it.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.103 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Do you think the wolves

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.504 align:middle line:90%
after they killed the deer,

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
they set up a little campfire
[laughter] and they put the deer

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.809 align:middle line:84%
on the campfire to roast it
and get it nice and crispy

00:19:37.809 --> 00:19:40.479 align:middle line:84%
so that it kills all the
potentially dangerous stuff?

00:19:40.479 --> 00:19:41.313 align:middle line:90%
Do you think they do that?

00:19:41.313 --> 00:19:43.615 align:middle line:90%
No. Do you think we did that?

00:19:43.615 --> 00:19:46.385 align:middle line:90%
No. It's always been raw.

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:47.152 align:middle line:90%
Everything's always --

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:48.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>>Anthony Gucciardi:
-- been raw.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.621 align:middle line:90%
This common

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
practice. I mean
sure we've used fire.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.391 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've used
lower heat --

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:53.091 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yep.

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:54.293 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:55.427 align:middle line:84%
but it's never been throw
it in the microwave --

00:19:55.427 --> 00:19:56.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: No,
no, no, of course not.

00:19:56.795 --> 00:19:57.996 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- and
then, you know, nuclear bomb it.

00:19:57.996 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And
it kills the enzymes too.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.098 align:middle line:90%
It kills all of that.

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:03.569 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to make that
point that all levels of fat

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
in their natural form are
generally okay for the body and,

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.474 align:middle line:84%
you know, the amounts
that are needed

00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.009 align:middle line:84%
for you personally
depending upon --

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:12.144 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:13.312 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: --
your amount of activity

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:14.613 align:middle line:84%
but they also play a
detox effect on the body.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:15.647 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: They do.

00:20:15.647 --> 00:20:17.883 align:middle line:84%
And I would also say
that particularly

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.551 align:middle line:84%
if you're exercising or
anything like that --

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.786 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:20:20.786 --> 00:20:21.553 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
you need to restore yourself

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:22.387 align:middle line:90%
with the central proteins.

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:24.222 align:middle line:90%
Protein means most important.

00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:25.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:20:25.591 --> 00:20:26.725 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I mean
it was during the Greek times

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:28.060 align:middle line:84%
where they determined it
was the most important.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:30.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Some people are saying now

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:33.098 align:middle line:84%
for every pound of bod -- every
pound in your body you need

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:34.366 align:middle line:90%
about two grams of protein.

00:20:34.366 --> 00:20:35.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:36.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
I mean we're prioritizing

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:37.836 align:middle line:90%
everything wrong.

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:41.473 align:middle line:84%
It's because of our
justification to addictions

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:42.708 align:middle line:84%
that we've gotten
to where we are.

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.042 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:45.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Back
in the day, as you mentioned,

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
scarcity was a major reason
as to why diets developed

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.084 align:middle line:84%
as they have and many of them
are healthy from eastern --

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.318 align:middle line:90%
look at the Mediterranean diet.

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:54.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:20:54.286 --> 00:20:55.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
But now look

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.122 align:middle line:84%
at what we call the
American diet.

00:20:57.122 --> 00:20:59.758 align:middle line:84%
Someone goes home and eats a
bunch of Twinkies and a Big Mac.

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.127 align:middle line:84%
It's not because they
think that's healthy it's

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:04.096 align:middle line:84%
because their addictions
are justifying it.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:06.331 align:middle line:84%
Or they go to McDonald's and
they say I'm getting a salad

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:10.402 align:middle line:84%
and of course it has [phonetic]
yoga mat chemical chicken inside

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.237 align:middle line:90%
of it and they're eating that up

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:13.472 align:middle line:84%
and they're thinking
it's healthy.

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:14.506 align:middle line:90%
That's the new health paradigm.

00:21:14.506 --> 00:21:16.208 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is as it seems anymore.

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You have to look into
what you're eating.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.244 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:20.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: We're
going to talk about how

00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:21.046 align:middle line:84%
to figure everything
out today pretty much.

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:21.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.148 align:middle line:90%
Okay. Now let's talk about --

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:25.417 align:middle line:84%
so you've taken in
various chemicals --

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:26.685 align:middle line:90%
we talked about the GMOs.

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:28.420 align:middle line:90%
We've talked about fluoride.

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.055 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about a
lot of other chemicals.

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:33.091 align:middle line:84%
Cadmium that our body has
taken in as we're detoxing.

00:21:33.091 --> 00:21:35.193 align:middle line:84%
Okay. First thing, start
the process in the morning

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:36.762 align:middle line:84%
with the hot water
with the lemon.

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:39.031 align:middle line:84%
Get everything open
and ready to do its job

00:21:39.031 --> 00:21:40.966 align:middle line:84%
and in breaking down
and cleansing.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:43.502 align:middle line:84%
Then we have to chew our
food to make sure we have all

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:45.937 align:middle line:84%
of those natural enzymes
and the moisture in there

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:48.940 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have to drink a
big gulp glass of, you know,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.544 align:middle line:84%
whatever, with it to get the
food down without choking.

00:21:52.544 --> 00:21:54.713 align:middle line:84%
And so we've covered
fats a little bit.

00:21:54.713 --> 00:21:57.949 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into something
that your fond of talking

00:21:57.949 --> 00:21:59.551 align:middle line:84%
about which is the
Nascent Iodine

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:02.854 align:middle line:84%
and what that's actually doing
in these fluoride cycles.

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:04.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right.

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:06.491 align:middle line:84%
So here is something really cool
that most people have no idea

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:09.594 align:middle line:84%
about and I've talked about this
with Dr. Stan Monteith on his --

00:22:09.594 --> 00:22:10.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:11.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- radio program.

00:22:11.463 --> 00:22:12.397 align:middle line:90%
And it was very informative.

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:13.365 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people really
enjoyed it

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.599 align:middle line:90%
and I've been talking about it.

00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:16.902 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to get one little
message out to everybody

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:18.704 align:middle line:84%
but the fact of the
matter is you can use this

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:19.905 align:middle line:90%
in your daily life.

00:22:19.905 --> 00:22:24.543 align:middle line:84%
So Nascent Iodine is the
preferred form of iodine.

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:25.911 align:middle line:84%
People will say there's
other forms.

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:28.447 align:middle line:84%
Okay, I understand that, but
if we take this form of iodine

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:30.916 align:middle line:84%
or at least another
super high quality form.

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.584 align:middle line:84%
What happens is something
amazing.

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:33.852 align:middle line:90%
Something very simple.

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.654 align:middle line:90%
Three drops on the tongue.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:39.991 align:middle line:84%
Goes into your body and it
actually turns sodium fluoride

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:43.228 align:middle line:84%
into calcium fluoride
which you can then urinate

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:44.863 align:middle line:90%
out of your body.

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:48.533 align:middle line:84%
So your detoxing the
fluoride that has been stored

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.602 align:middle line:90%
in your body for years.

00:22:50.602 --> 00:22:52.904 align:middle line:84%
I mean you're taking in fluoride
whether you know it or not

00:22:52.904 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:84%
if you're showering without
a fluoride shower filter

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.175 align:middle line:84%
which no one has unless
you have a home filter.

00:22:57.175 --> 00:23:00.212 align:middle line:84%
So everyone needs to
start taking this form

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:04.783 align:middle line:84%
of iodine every day on
the recommended amount

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:07.886 align:middle line:84%
of intake each day and
you'll be detoxing fluoride

00:23:07.886 --> 00:23:09.721 align:middle line:84%
out of your body and
it's that simple.

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:10.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Three
drops on the tongue.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:13.525 align:middle line:84%
Now first of all,
what is the difference

00:23:13.525 --> 00:23:15.794 align:middle line:90%
between Nascent fluoride and --

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
or iodine and some of the other
forms of iodine that you see?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.135 align:middle line:84%
I mean I was taking
one that was a --

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:27.439 align:middle line:84%
it was a nanotechnology
type of iodine

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:29.441 align:middle line:90%
for example for a while there.

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.343 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:33.278 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It really
comes down to the same type

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:35.113 align:middle line:84%
of question like
what's the difference

00:23:35.113 --> 00:23:39.351 align:middle line:84%
between a regular tincture
that's used glycerin or alcohol

00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:41.253 align:middle line:84%
or what's the difference
between a tincture that you find

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.555 align:middle line:84%
in the pharmacy versus
one that you find

00:23:43.555 --> 00:23:44.656 align:middle line:90%
from a high quality retailer?

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:45.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.291 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:46.291 --> 00:23:47.292 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
mean it really just comes

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:48.460 align:middle line:84%
down to production
for the most part.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:53.365 align:middle line:84%
I mean I use Dr. Groups
Nascent Iodine and --

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:54.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: He's --

00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
I know he is so diligent
in sourcing only the best

00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.704 align:middle line:90%
and cleanest of everything.

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:01.273 align:middle line:84%
I have nothing but
respect for his work --

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:01.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:24:01.706 --> 00:24:02.774 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:03.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
-- and his products.

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:04.409 align:middle line:90%
I use some of his products too.

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:04.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:06.211 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:06.211 --> 00:24:06.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So you said
that's the best [inaudible]

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:07.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:08.780 align:middle line:84%
The Nascent is also
the most absorbable.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.383 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: The
absorbability is extremely high.

00:24:11.383 --> 00:24:13.985 align:middle line:84%
The general quality of
something like that is just --

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:15.854 align:middle line:90%
it's extremely high quality.

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:16.621 align:middle line:90%
I would --

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:17.856 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
go for something like that.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So just
look for Nascent Iodine.

00:24:20.158 --> 00:24:21.760 align:middle line:84%
And what are the iodines
to basically avoid

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.762 align:middle line:84%
that people commonly
think they can take

00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:25.797 align:middle line:84%
because they're doing some
benefit to their body?

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:27.499 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Anything
you find in the drugstore

00:24:27.499 --> 00:24:29.601 align:middle line:84%
or your grocery store,
baseline, don't get it.

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:24:30.969 --> 00:24:32.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I mean
it comes into researching it.

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:34.573 align:middle line:84%
There are a million
different forms of iodine --

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:35.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:36.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- but the
one thing you also don't want

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:84%
to get is the little
iodine tablets.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:41.179 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I'm
going to get flak for this

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.380 align:middle line:84%
because everyone sells it and
everyone makes a lot of money

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.282 align:middle line:84%
for it -- from it, but
the little iodine tablets,

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:46.718 align:middle line:84%
the emergency tablets --
okay, if it's an emergency,

00:24:46.718 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:84%
if there's nuclear
fallout happening, right,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.355 align:middle line:84%
and there's a nuclear
bomb outside

00:24:50.355 --> 00:24:52.157 align:middle line:84%
and all you have are the
little iodine tablets --

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:53.525 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yep.

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:55.026 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- that
the DHS gives out, go ahead.

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:57.062 align:middle line:84%
But the point is
those tablets are

00:24:57.062 --> 00:25:00.365 align:middle line:84%
so low quality why do you
think they store forever

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:02.334 align:middle line:90%
and are so cheap?

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.736 align:middle line:84%
Because of the quality
fact and their little --

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:06.838 align:middle line:84%
I don't really like
tablets anyway.

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:08.206 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:09.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I think
a tincture is the best form

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:10.508 align:middle line:84%
of taking pretty much
anything these days

00:25:10.508 --> 00:25:12.811 align:middle line:84%
since we have the
technology to do spagyrics, --

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:13.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:15.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- which is way better,

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:16.448 align:middle line:84%
but those little tablets,
I would avoid those.

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:18.083 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.752 align:middle line:90%
So now let's talk about the gut.

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:22.988 align:middle line:84%
I mean the calcium fluoride
we're now eliminating

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:24.222 align:middle line:90%
that out of the body -- Yes.

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:25.023 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Oh.

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.358 align:middle line:90%
One important thing as well.

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:29.160 align:middle line:84%
When you take the iodine and
it turns the sodium fluoride

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.796 align:middle line:84%
into calcium fluoride you're
leeching calcium from your body

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:33.398 align:middle line:84%
so you're going to
need to restore that.

00:25:33.398 --> 00:25:35.166 align:middle line:90%
There's interesting information,

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:38.336 align:middle line:84%
research that shows pretty much
every single calcium supplement

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:39.037 align:middle line:90%
is dangerous.

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:39.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:40.906 align:middle line:90%
I've been reading about it.

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Believe it or not.

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:43.308 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get calcium
intake from your foods.

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:44.676 align:middle line:90%
It's also interesting to note

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.945 align:middle line:84%
that calcium is highly
alkalizing.

00:25:46.945 --> 00:25:48.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:50.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So it's
aiding you in multiple ways

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:53.785 align:middle line:84%
and some of the best calcium
food sources are all alkaline

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:56.121 align:middle line:84%
in nature so continue to
eat your nuts and everything

00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:57.756 align:middle line:84%
like that that are
high in calcium and try

00:25:57.756 --> 00:26:00.191 align:middle line:84%
to avoid any supplements
that are pure calcium.

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:00.959 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:01.927 align:middle line:90%
That's a very good point.

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:03.995 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So absorption
of nutrients.

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:06.031 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk about
that and the acid

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:07.432 align:middle line:90%
in the lining of the guts.

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:09.567 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the lack
of mental clarity,

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.636 align:middle line:84%
right and it really
does start in the gut

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:13.571 align:middle line:84%
and let's start making
this relationship

00:26:13.571 --> 00:26:15.240 align:middle line:84%
between the gut and
the brain now.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.641 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Sure.

00:26:16.641 --> 00:26:19.144 align:middle line:84%
So not only does your overall
health really begin in the gut,

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:22.981 align:middle line:84%
but research has found
using different models

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.785 align:middle line:84%
that really your mental health
starts in the gut specifically.

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:28.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:26:28.086 --> 00:26:31.122 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So we
see people that are crazy.

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:32.324 align:middle line:90%
Mentally unstable.

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:33.591 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Lots now.

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Lots
and it's due to the stress

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.296 align:middle line:90%
that affects their gut health.

00:26:38.296 --> 00:26:39.998 align:middle line:84%
It's due to the fact
that they're on a number

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:43.935 align:middle line:84%
of pharmaceutical drugs like a
ton of antibiotics that go in

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:46.938 align:middle line:84%
and destroy the good
probiotic bacteria in your gut

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:48.106 align:middle line:90%
so you have an imbalance.

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:49.841 align:middle line:84%
Think about it with
the yin-yang symbol.

00:26:49.841 --> 00:26:50.976 align:middle line:90%
All the black is taking over.

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:53.044 align:middle line:84%
It's just one big
black circle now.

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:55.947 align:middle line:84%
So the bad bacteria
has infested the gut

00:26:55.947 --> 00:26:59.084 align:middle line:84%
and in response your mind
just can't handle it.

00:26:59.084 --> 00:27:02.854 align:middle line:84%
The gut affect transports
to your brain.

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:05.724 align:middle line:84%
So when someone's gut is
imbalanced, their mind,

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:08.827 align:middle line:84%
their mentality, their
perception is imbalanced.

00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:10.428 align:middle line:84%
You ever meet someone
that's just kind of off?

00:27:10.428 --> 00:27:12.397 align:middle line:84%
Like they're just -- they
can't get it together,

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:14.699 align:middle line:84%
they can't organize anything,
they can't hold a job --

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Sure.

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:16.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- or
even they're literally insane.

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:18.470 align:middle line:90%
They're literally schizophrenic.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:21.539 align:middle line:84%
We're finding that by
changing the gut health

00:27:21.539 --> 00:27:24.776 align:middle line:84%
of these people they can
live in an entirely new life

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:26.945 align:middle line:84%
without antidepressants
that are linked

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.546 align:middle line:90%
to suicide and hostility --

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:29.914 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:31.349 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- without
these various mental health

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:33.518 align:middle line:84%
drugs that one in ten
people will be put

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:35.687 align:middle line:90%
on in their lifetime.

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Apparently also 50% of
Americans will be diagnosed

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.359 align:middle line:84%
with a mental health
problem in their life.

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:42.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
what does that tell you?

00:27:43.194 --> 00:27:44.462 align:middle line:90%
There's something wrong.

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:46.798 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] People aren't
just magically turning crazy.

00:27:46.798 --> 00:27:48.133 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:49.534 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
it's not the better diagnosis

00:27:49.534 --> 00:27:52.437 align:middle line:84%
because the diagnosis is based
on a profit driven model.

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.939 align:middle line:84%
The antidepressant market
alone is billions upon billions

00:27:54.939 --> 00:27:55.907 align:middle line:90%
of dollars.

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:57.609 align:middle line:84%
So what it turns
into now is we need

00:27:57.609 --> 00:27:59.210 align:middle line:84%
to take our health
into our own hands.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:01.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: We need

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.113 align:middle line:84%
to start understanding
how probiotics work.

00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:03.515 align:middle line:84%
You can take a probiotic
supplement.

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:06.651 align:middle line:84%
Make sure it's high quality like
a Latero Flora type supplement.

00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:09.587 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately fermented
foods is the answer.

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:12.557 align:middle line:84%
You want stuff like
kimchi or even raw milk

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.926 align:middle line:84%
if you can get a hold of
it before going to jail.

00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:15.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: I know.

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:16.795 align:middle line:90%
It's illegal in most states.

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:17.862 align:middle line:84%
I mean what they've
done to [inaudible]

00:28:17.862 --> 00:28:19.664 align:middle line:84%
in California has
just been amazing,

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:22.534 align:middle line:84%
raiding him like he was
a crack lab or something

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.969 align:middle line:84%
for having raw milk
around in the shop.

00:28:24.969 --> 00:28:25.403 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right.

00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:26.504 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:27.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
I know it's terrible.

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:28.473 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Well it's crack

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:29.274 align:middle line:84%
for your health but
also Kombucha --

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:30.675 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:31.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- is a
good option and people love it.

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:32.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Talk about Kombucha.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.645 align:middle line:90%
>>Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:34.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Most
people don't know that.

00:28:34.646 --> 00:28:36.014 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Check this out.

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.582 align:middle line:84%
So if you like soda and can't
get off of it, try Kombucha.

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:41.753 align:middle line:84%
It's fermented tea and
basically it tastes somewhat

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:43.288 align:middle line:90%
like a good type of soda.

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: It
has a very alcoholly kind

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.259 align:middle line:84%
of off gassing on
the breath afterward.

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:49.394 align:middle line:84%
There's some people
I've known --

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:50.228 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
We're not talking

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:50.995 align:middle line:90%
about alcoholic Kombucha though.

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
There's a difference.

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:53.865 align:middle line:84%
We don't want alcoholic
Kombucha.

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:55.266 align:middle line:90%
No matter how you slice it,

00:28:55.266 --> 00:28:57.268 align:middle line:84%
sure the research shows alcohol
can benefit you in some ways.

00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:58.436 align:middle line:90%
It's a neurotoxin.

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:00.271 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
And at the end

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:01.039 align:middle line:90%
of the day it's a neurotoxin.

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:90%
I don't drink any alcohol.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.074 align:middle line:90%
I don't advocate it.

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:03.875 align:middle line:90%
Even wine.

00:29:03.875 --> 00:29:05.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I mean it has benefits

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:07.011 align:middle line:90%
but it's a neurotoxin.

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.279 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So let's
talk about the difference

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:09.481 align:middle line:84%
in those Kombuchas though
because that's what a lot

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:11.549 align:middle line:84%
of people I know have been
drinking and it smells

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:12.917 align:middle line:84%
like they've had
beer for breakfast.

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:14.185 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right.

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.286 align:middle line:84%
Well if you're having an
alcoholic Kombucha basically you

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:17.555 align:middle line:84%
are having beer, so
I don't advocate that

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.557 align:middle line:84%
but basically the
fermentation process

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:22.127 align:middle line:84%
for Kombucha can
be non-alcoholic

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:24.062 align:middle line:84%
and what you get is you
get this fermented tea

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:27.398 align:middle line:84%
that has a large amount of
probiotic activity inside of it

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:30.301 align:middle line:84%
so when you're consuming it
you're restoring the probiotic

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:32.170 align:middle line:90%
bacteria to your stomach.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.037 align:middle line:90%
To your gut.

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:34.506 align:middle line:90%
Now one interesting thing is

00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:37.408 align:middle line:84%
that all the fermented foods
have to be refrigerated

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:39.511 align:middle line:84%
to keep the bacteria alive
so you have to fit this

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:42.313 align:middle line:84%
in with your schedule, make sure
you're drinking the warm water

00:29:42.313 --> 00:29:43.915 align:middle line:84%
beforehand and everything
like that.

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:46.951 align:middle line:84%
With the Kombucha it is cold
and it will be a challenge

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:49.454 align:middle line:84%
to consume it with your
meal as you may have

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:52.457 align:middle line:84%
found if you're sitting there
drinking some cold Kombucha

00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:54.259 align:middle line:84%
with your meal you're not
going to digest it very well.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:55.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You might
have a stomach ache now.

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:56.261 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.629 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to need
to drink it between meals.

00:29:57.629 --> 00:30:01.099 align:middle line:84%
But I mean you can get
fermented probiotic rich foods

00:30:01.099 --> 00:30:02.367 align:middle line:90%
in so many ways.

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:03.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Well,

00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.570 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about the whole
explosion of kefir everywhere.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.438 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's been
co-opted I think

00:30:07.438 --> 00:30:11.709 align:middle line:84%
by the large corporations now
but let's talk about good kefir,

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:14.979 align:middle line:84%
bad kefir and again I know
it comes down to raw kefir --

00:30:14.979 --> 00:30:15.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Yeah it does.

00:30:15.947 --> 00:30:17.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
-- in the end.

00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:18.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I mean it really does.

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:19.017 align:middle line:84%
And it also comes down
to any of those juices.

00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:19.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:20.852 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You want

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:22.453 align:middle line:84%
to be optimally be
making it yourself

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:24.022 align:middle line:84%
or at least have some
-- there's people

00:30:24.022 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
who make their own
Kombucha, for example.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.824 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:30:26.824 --> 00:30:27.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And they
know the quality is there.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:28.927 align:middle line:90%
They don't use fluoride.

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:32.597 align:middle line:84%
What's actually cool about the
fermentation process for kefir

00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:34.599 align:middle line:84%
and Kombucha and things like
that is they usually have

00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.869 align:middle line:84%
to use distilled water so
there's no fluoride in it

00:30:37.869 --> 00:30:38.736 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:30:38.736 --> 00:30:40.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:41.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: We've
tested the Kombucha products

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:43.575 align:middle line:84%
like GTs and stuff there's
pretty much no fluoride in there

00:30:43.575 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:84%
so that's a good thing
to know for all those

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.778 align:middle line:90%
who were concerned about that.

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:47.979 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: But
yeah, the kefir and all

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.782 align:middle line:84%
of it I mean they turn it
into a corporate gimmick --

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:53.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And they've
got squeezy tubes of yogurt

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:55.787 align:middle line:84%
for your kid's gut
health, you know.

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:56.287 align:middle line:90%
It's blue.

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:57.088 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:30:57.088 --> 00:30:58.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:30:58.022 --> 00:30:58.856 align:middle line:84%
And the probiotic
activity in most

00:30:58.856 --> 00:31:00.058 align:middle line:90%
of those is like nonexistent --

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:01.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:02.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- and
they say oh it's so great

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.828 align:middle line:84%
for you but -- and then
they have the yogurt

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:06.197 align:middle line:84%
like I just saw it the other
day talks about the probiotics

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:08.967 align:middle line:84%
on the front and then
it has aspartame in it.

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:10.168 align:middle line:90%
Aspartame is made

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:12.737 align:middle line:84%
from genetically
modified fecal bacteria.

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:16.341 align:middle line:84%
There's a 1998 independent
report that talks

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:18.610 align:middle line:84%
about with a Monsanto
representative inside

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.913 align:middle line:84%
in the article discussing how
they created the genetically

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:24.849 align:middle line:84%
modified bacteria waste
that was ultimately made

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.951 align:middle line:90%
to grow aspartame.

00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So what you're doing when you're
eating something like yogurt

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.955 align:middle line:84%
that has probiotics
in it with aspartame

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:34.626 align:middle line:84%
as well is you're completely
going against the entire idea,

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:37.095 align:middle line:84%
the concept behind
probiotics the to begin with.

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:38.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Yes, absolutely

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:40.465 align:middle line:84%
and then this would
be true of anything

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:42.300 align:middle line:84%
that says pretty much
any package thing

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.468 align:middle line:90%
that says sugar free on it.

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:45.637 align:middle line:84%
Now a few of them have
switched over to Stevia

00:31:45.637 --> 00:31:48.139 align:middle line:84%
but it will usually advertise
that pretty loudly on the label.

00:31:48.139 --> 00:31:50.174 align:middle line:84%
So if it says sugar
free you're getting

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.609 align:middle line:90%
into the zone of aspartame.

00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:52.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
you talk about Stevia.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.811 align:middle line:84%
There's difference
in quality there.

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.280 align:middle line:84%
I understand there's some
negative effects there,

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.548 align:middle line:84%
etc. but if we did
something overnight

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and we switched all
sugar and everything

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:02.353 align:middle line:84%
to a natural sweetener
like Stevia, we would --

00:32:02.353 --> 00:32:04.289 align:middle line:84%
diabetes would not
exist anymore.

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:05.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Absolutely.

00:32:05.523 --> 00:32:06.958 align:middle line:84%
And our gut health would
improve almost immediately.

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.092 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:10.528 align:middle line:84%
and sugar is number one
destroyer of gut health.

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:12.664 align:middle line:84%
All of us struggle
with sugar addiction --

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:13.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:14.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- to some extent.

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:15.667 align:middle line:90%
It's been shown in research

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:17.168 align:middle line:84%
that it's actually more
addicting than crack.

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:18.136 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:19.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
I believe that.

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:20.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
It's been shown.

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:20.838 align:middle line:84%
Actually it might
have been cocaine.

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:21.973 align:middle line:90%
There's a difference.

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.341 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a drug user so
I don't know the exact.

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:25.476 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Either
way I believe sugar is more

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:26.477 align:middle line:90%
addictive personally.

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:27.412 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:28.646 align:middle line:84%
It actually has been
shown to be.

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:30.381 align:middle line:84%
And there's researchers who
have said hey, you know,

00:32:30.381 --> 00:32:33.551 align:middle line:84%
we shouldn't have certain
levels of sugar in our foods

00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:36.387 align:middle line:84%
because what happens is
just like fat and salt,

00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:39.791 align:middle line:84%
like potato chips, the reason
you want more than one is

00:32:39.791 --> 00:32:42.960 align:middle line:84%
because instinctually
if we were surviving

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.699 align:middle line:84%
out in the wilderness right now
as we did quite some time ago,

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:50.234 align:middle line:84%
what would happen is if we found
something like that we'd want

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:52.870 align:middle line:84%
as much as we possibly could
because it's an amazing source

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.005 align:middle line:90%
of minerals and nutrients.

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:57.442 align:middle line:84%
We want salt because we
crave certain minerals.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:33:00.211 align:middle line:84%
Well sugar is like a
treat to the brain.

00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:01.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
It's like nothing else.

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:04.315 align:middle line:84%
You know, generally you get a
little bit of sugar and fruits

00:33:04.315 --> 00:33:05.650 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.353 align:middle line:84%
They have through technology
taken this to the next step.

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:11.055 align:middle line:84%
There's literally candy
treats that are just sugar --

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:12.457 align:middle line:90%
>>Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:13.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- in a
little pouch and you just put it

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:16.994 align:middle line:84%
on your mouth like those little
Pixie things or whatever.

00:33:16.994 --> 00:33:17.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:18.363 align:middle line:90%
Pixie straws.

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:19.063 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:20.198 align:middle line:90%
They're just pure sugar.

00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's messing with our
psychology completely.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.301 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.302 align:middle line:90%
People literally --

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:25.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: So let's --

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:26.738 align:middle line:84%
I mean, let's talk about
it going back to the gut.

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:29.006 align:middle line:84%
So what it does -- what
is it doing in the gut

00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:30.408 align:middle line:84%
that is then affecting
the brain?

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:33.378 align:middle line:84%
We need to have very -- we
need to be reminded constantly

00:33:33.378 --> 00:33:36.080 align:middle line:84%
because so many people
do struggle

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.315 align:middle line:90%
with this particular addiction.

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:39.550 align:middle line:84%
We have to be reminded
almost daily.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.918 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
they get addicted to sugar.

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:43.888 align:middle line:84%
They become depressed they want
sugar as a comforting food.

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:44.956 align:middle line:90%
They eat it.

00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:46.224 align:middle line:84%
It goes in and destroys
the good bacteria

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:49.427 align:middle line:84%
in our gut disrupts the entire
digestive system balance

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:52.864 align:middle line:84%
and then what happens is their
mental strain increases extra,

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:55.066 align:middle line:90%
you know, beyond what it was.

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So then the next day they have
even increased mental strain

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:02.807 align:middle line:84%
reduced clarity and they want
to seek a response so they go

00:34:02.807 --> 00:34:04.041 align:middle line:84%
and get the sugar and
they think it's going

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.175 align:middle line:90%
to make them feel better.

00:34:05.175 --> 00:34:06.644 align:middle line:84%
The reality is, you have
to understand you have

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:09.480 align:middle line:84%
to have their perception
that's not the answer.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.983 align:middle line:84%
That is like you have your arm
cut off and you put a band-aid

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.619 align:middle line:84%
on it, you know, you
need some serious help.

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:17.288 align:middle line:84%
What you need to do is avoid
all sugars as much as you can

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and use natural sweeteners
like Stevia, for example,

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.529 align:middle line:84%
or have some fruit that
has beneficial compounds

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.798 align:middle line:84%
and nutrients and minerals
in it that combat --

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:27.665 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Phytochemicals all of it.

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:29.032 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:29.032 --> 00:34:30.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- yes
that combat the sugar and not

00:34:30.101 --> 00:34:30.968 align:middle line:84%
to mention it's a
natural form of sugar

00:34:30.968 --> 00:34:32.302 align:middle line:90%
so it's actually healthy.

00:34:32.302 --> 00:34:33.905 align:middle line:84%
So what you can do is
you could have juice.

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:36.074 align:middle line:84%
That's what I offer to people
who are addicted to sugar.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Try

00:34:38.108 --> 00:34:41.479 align:middle line:84%
in the morning having some
watermelon juice each day

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.014 align:middle line:90%
from your juicer or -- and then

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:45.049 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon
try some apples.

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:46.584 align:middle line:90%
Some green apples and then

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:48.553 align:middle line:84%
after that you can start
incorporating vegetables

00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:49.720 align:middle line:90%
like celery into this.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.722 align:middle line:84%
You can juice apples
with vegetables.

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:54.292 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't add most
fruits with vegetables --

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:55.526 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:34:55.526 --> 00:34:56.327 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
but you can juice apples --

00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:56.861 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Apples.

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:57.962 align:middle line:90%
Right. Yeah.

00:34:57.962 --> 00:34:59.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- with vegetables.

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:00.565 align:middle line:84%
So you can try something like
juice for example or Kombucha

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:01.933 align:middle line:84%
like I said, which is
very low sugar in Kombucha

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.902 align:middle line:84%
but it tastes kind of like a
[phonetic] sodaie drink that's

00:35:04.902 --> 00:35:06.604 align:middle line:84%
actually healthy so
there's many alternatives

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:08.706 align:middle line:84%
to concurring that
sugar addiction.

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.175 align:middle line:84%
and also the detox
piece of the story.

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:16.013 align:middle line:84%
Once your body is populated
with this unbeneficial bacteria

00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.949 align:middle line:84%
that the sugar brings
with it and allows to feed

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:20.384 align:middle line:84%
on you really aren't
going to detox anything.

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:24.121 align:middle line:84%
I sounds like it's virtually
impossible to do a real detox

00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:26.691 align:middle line:84%
of your body and I'm not talking
a harsh one just day-to-day

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:29.627 align:middle line:84%
gentle detoxing if
you're eating sugars.

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:31.596 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right,
well nothing's impossible.

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:34.031 align:middle line:84%
You can detox right away while
you're still having these sugar

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:34.832 align:middle line:90%
addictions --

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:35.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.068 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
but you're right 100%.

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:37.869 align:middle line:84%
I mean the sugar is
devastating your body --

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:39.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:40.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- to
the point where you're trying

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:43.908 align:middle line:84%
to heal it while also dumping
rocks as fuel like I mentioned.

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:45.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: But you
can start doing things also

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.580 align:middle line:84%
like if you eat more
fruits and vegetables

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.115 align:middle line:90%
in the sense start juicing

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:53.651 align:middle line:84%
or start taking higher
quality probiotic supplements,

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:58.089 align:middle line:84%
stuff like that, you'll
fill your mineral deficiency

00:35:58.089 --> 00:36:00.925 align:middle line:84%
that is requiring you to
eat things like salty foods

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:03.094 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes in my
cases, sweet foods.

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:04.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So when
you have the real substitute,

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.232 align:middle line:84%
when you're craving sugar
and you eat apples instead --

00:36:08.232 --> 00:36:09.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You're
fulfilling your body in a way

00:36:10.434 --> 00:36:12.003 align:middle line:90%
that you have not yet realized

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:13.971 align:middle line:84%
because you don't understand
what it's telling you.

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.072 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
And ultimately your

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.708 align:middle line:84%
over all health will
increase and your immunity

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:20.811 align:middle line:90%
since your gut proliferation

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:23.080 align:middle line:84%
of good bacteria is
really what stands

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.315 align:middle line:90%
for your overall immunity.

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:25.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Absolutely.

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:26.918 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I was told
that many years ago.

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:31.022 align:middle line:84%
I was doing an interview
back in the very early phases

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:90%
of the energy technology.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.726 align:middle line:84%
This was in Germany with a
well known physicist of the day

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:38.796 align:middle line:84%
and that was the one thing
that stuck out that he told me

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.331 align:middle line:84%
about he was talking about
[phonetic] bowson stew

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:42.934 align:middle line:84%
which were not really
public and even the world

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
of science wasn't familiar
until decades later

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:50.341 align:middle line:84%
but the profound thing was all
health starts in your intestines

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:53.210 align:middle line:84%
and in your colon and we
must take care of those first

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:54.745 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
will follow that.

00:36:54.745 --> 00:36:55.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
That's exactly right.

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:56.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
And that is true.

00:36:56.814 --> 00:36:58.749 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So let's talk
about the kimchi

00:36:58.749 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and some of the other things.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you make your own
sauerkraut in kimchi?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.988 align:middle line:84%
I mean these are
good sources of --

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:05.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
-- probiotics, right?

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.592 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:08.426 align:middle line:84%
Those are excellent
sources and consider this

00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:09.660 align:middle line:90%
to get some more motivation too.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.795 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: It
just stinks, kimchi stinks.

00:37:10.795 --> 00:37:11.562 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.198 align:middle line:84%
Some of the fermented foods
aren't exactly the best that's

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:84%
why we talk about Kombucha
and stuff that actually --

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:17.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- is good.

00:37:17.868 --> 00:37:19.437 align:middle line:84%
Or you know any form of your
own fermentation pickles.

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:20.571 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
If you like pickles --

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:22.473 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:23.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
they're great as well.

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:24.542 align:middle line:84%
But think about this as a
form of motivation as well.

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:26.110 align:middle line:90%
We know bird flu.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:29.647 align:middle line:90%
We know deadly mutations

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:32.083 align:middle line:84%
of various diseases
have been hitting.

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:33.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Well your first line

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:36.654 align:middle line:90%
of defense isn't a vaccine.

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:37.788 align:middle line:90%
Quite the opposite.

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:40.858 align:middle line:84%
It's your probiotic
activity in your body.

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:42.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:45.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It's
the cellular level of defense.

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:46.998 align:middle line:90%
So when you have something

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:49.066 align:middle line:84%
like that that's
devastating people it's

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:53.070 align:middle line:84%
because their gut health is not
in ball -- it's not in balance.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.605 align:middle line:90%
It's imbalanced not in balance.

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:55.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:56.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So what
we have to do is restore it

00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:57.942 align:middle line:90%
with these fermented foods.

00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:59.343 align:middle line:84%
So if you see something
like that

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:00.244 align:middle line:90%
and you don't know what to do --

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:02.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: There
are natural cures and herbs

00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:05.750 align:middle line:84%
for certain ailments but
overall, any disease,

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.519 align:middle line:84%
it has to come through this
probiotic layer of defense.

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.955 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
it's selectively permeable.

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So
let's talk about yogurt.

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:16.727 align:middle line:84%
If your yogurt is pasteurized
milk -- even if it's organic --

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:17.862 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right.

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:18.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: But
if it's been pasteurized

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:21.966 align:middle line:84%
and then had the
probiotic elements,

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the bacteria strains added to
it is it still fairly beneficial

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.005 align:middle line:84%
or are you going to say
that's a compromise.

00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:29.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You
really have to weigh the --

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:30.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
[phonetic] Incompromise.

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:31.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- the pros and cons.

00:38:31.008 --> 00:38:32.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
mean it's a big compromise.

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:36.847 align:middle line:84%
It comes down to -- if it's 100%
organic and locally, you know,

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.149 align:middle line:90%
created and Everything like that

00:38:38.149 --> 00:38:40.551 align:middle line:84%
and it has probiotic
activity added to it

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.819 align:middle line:90%
but it's still pasteurized --

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:43.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:44.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- I
don't know, I don't really --

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:45.923 align:middle line:84%
I would not consume any
pasteurized dairy at all.

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:46.891 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:47.658 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Personally.

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:49.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:38:49.026 --> 00:38:50.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: But yeah
there is some benefit to it

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:50.728 align:middle line:84%
since there is probiotic
activity.

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:51.829 align:middle line:90%
I think you should look

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.197 align:middle line:84%
for other fermented
foods though instead.

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:54.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So away
from the dairy fermentations.

00:38:54.598 --> 00:38:55.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:55.866 align:middle line:90%
Asian food --

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:56.567 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:57.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:38:57.635 --> 00:38:58.969 align:middle line:84%
has a lot of fermented
inclusions in it.

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:00.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well
in eastern European as well

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:02.306 align:middle line:84%
because as you say, you
know, you start a meal

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:04.008 align:middle line:84%
in a traditional
eastern European

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:84%
or even German household
you have these little trays

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.846 align:middle line:84%
of pickles and all these
things that are set out.

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.748 align:middle line:90%
I mean I assume that is by --

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:14.552 align:middle line:84%
that's my understanding
throughout the family history

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:16.587 align:middle line:84%
and the history of the
culture that these are things

00:39:16.587 --> 00:39:19.990 align:middle line:84%
that help bring digestive
benefits to the diet right?

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And then
we wonder why everything's

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:23.327 align:middle line:84%
so bad when we eat
out of a box all day.

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:24.528 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:25.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
mean like we were talking

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:90%
about earlier, there's a reason

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.300 align:middle line:84%
that cultures have
instituted the various diets --

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:39:30.434 --> 00:39:31.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- like we know what --

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:32.436 align:middle line:84%
if I were to say Chinese
food, you know what it is.

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:33.838 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.172 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You know
the Americanized version anyway.

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:36.307 align:middle line:84%
If I were to say Mediterranean
diet you know what it is.

00:39:36.307 --> 00:39:37.274 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:38.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
German food.

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:38.876 align:middle line:90%
Anything, you would know --

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:39.877 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:39:39.877 --> 00:39:40.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- what it is.

00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:41.979 align:middle line:90%
But American food --

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:43.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: You
don't know what it is.

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:44.081 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
it's consider to be either --

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.216 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Fast food.

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:45.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- nothing or burgers.

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:46.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.118 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:48.219 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:48.919 align:middle line:84%
So all these cultures
have created a diet

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:49.720 align:middle line:90%
that fits their type --

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.421 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:53.157 align:middle line:84%
but also incorporates a lot
of probiotic activity --

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:53.858 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Absolutely.

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:54.925 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
into the diet and we
have abandoned that.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.363 align:middle line:84%
Enter this new kind
of horrible ideology

00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:00.898 align:middle line:90%
that nutrition doesn't matter.

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: That
there's not a place for anything

00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:06.003 align:middle line:84%
and also if you can cram as
many healthy foods into our diet

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:06.971 align:middle line:90%
as possible then we'll be fine.

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:07.671 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
It'll compensate

00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:08.773 align:middle line:90%
for all the crap foods.

00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:10.441 align:middle line:84%
You know in the Balkans,
the people are known

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:13.110 align:middle line:84%
for their longevity and
that's because of their yogurt

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.380 align:middle line:84%
but that's from their
cows that they milk

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.115 align:middle line:84%
and they do their
own processes on.

00:40:18.115 --> 00:40:19.617 align:middle line:90%
The stuff is not pasteurized.

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:22.219 align:middle line:84%
It was not historically and
still is not pasteurized.

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:23.721 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
bring that up again.

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:27.224 align:middle line:84%
If you have a cow or access
to a cow which in California

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:28.425 align:middle line:90%
when we were living there --

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It's
actually not that hard.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: It's not.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.195 align:middle line:84%
It's not hard at all
to make those things.

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:32.596 align:middle line:90%
I have some friends doing that

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.198 align:middle line:84%
and making their
own sauerkrauts.

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean this has become a kind

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.802 align:middle line:84%
of a popular theme
right now, right?

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:39.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Worst case
scenario, you can go to a store

00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:41.872 align:middle line:84%
and get fermented foods
that aren't pasteurized.

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:42.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I mean there is

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.876 align:middle line:84%
at Whole Foods even there
is a fermented food section.

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:47.211 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:48.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You know,
it is relatively simple --

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
[laughter] Yeah.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:53.551 align:middle line:84%
to do and also when you're
drinking the juice from fruits

00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:56.754 align:middle line:84%
and everything like that there's
enzymatic activity that's still

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:58.055 align:middle line:90%
highly beneficial.

00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.323 align:middle line:84%
I mean enzymes are going in
and breaking down the food

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:00.391 align:middle line:90%
that you're eating as well.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:01.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:02.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
It's virtually,

00:41:02.193 --> 00:41:03.027 align:middle line:90%
essentially the same thing.

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:04.495 align:middle line:90%
So you want all forms of this.

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:07.932 align:middle line:84%
In fact organically at a base
level when you're turning

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:11.702 align:middle line:84%
to these foods that are
not filled with pesticides

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:14.238 align:middle line:84%
and everything and are
actually organic and local,

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:18.242 align:middle line:84%
you're already accomplishing
99.9% of the goals you need --

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- when
it comes to healthy eating.

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:21.545 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:22.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Sometimes it just takes

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:25.249 align:middle line:84%
that little extra conscious push
toward the probiotic area --

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:26.617 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:41:26.617 --> 00:41:27.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- to
get enough in your daily life

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and you'll notice a
difference mentally.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.622 align:middle line:84%
But I will say also
a prediction.

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:34.425 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing a little bit with
people talking about probiotics

00:41:34.425 --> 00:41:37.995 align:middle line:84%
and how great they are right
now but as Vitamin D was

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:41.131 align:middle line:84%
about a year ago, this huge
sensational phenomenon that,

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.800 align:middle line:84%
you know, Vitamin D
is excellent and is --

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:45.669 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
probiotics are the next step.

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:46.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.372 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: People
are going to realize soon

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:51.642 align:middle line:84%
that probiotics is really the
answer to so many conditions.

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Really everything.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:54.111 align:middle line:90%
It's the baseline community.

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
If it heals the guts,

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.547 align:middle line:84%
it heals the body,
it heals the brain.

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:57.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:58.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
It makes total sense.

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:00.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: In fact
if you were not even going

00:42:00.117 --> 00:42:01.986 align:middle line:84%
to eat anything organic
or eat crap all day long

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:03.821 align:middle line:84%
and there was one
thing you had to do,

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:06.090 align:middle line:84%
it would be to restore
your probiotic activity

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:08.125 align:middle line:84%
because the probiotics
and the enzymes can go in

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.261 align:middle line:84%
and when you're eating food,
when you're chewing food,

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.595 align:middle line:90%
if you're eating McDonald's

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.764 align:middle line:84%
and you're chewing it
slowly 45 times at least --

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.032 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.166 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
until it's mush in your mouth,

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.201 align:middle line:84%
the enzymes are going
in and already breaking

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.603 align:middle line:84%
down the negative
ingredients inside.

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:23.073 align:middle line:84%
So before it even goes into
your gut it's being broken down

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:25.609 align:middle line:84%
and assimilated into nutrients
and getting rid of all

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.111 align:middle line:84%
that garbage that
you don't want.

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:29.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
So right there and then,

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:30.047 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's highly beneficial.

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:31.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And then
when it gets into your gut

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:33.884 align:middle line:84%
if you have enough
probiotic bacteria in there

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:36.987 align:middle line:84%
and enzymes it will break it
down and it'll assimilate it

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:39.890 align:middle line:84%
into nutrients somehow even
though there are none really

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.793 align:middle line:84%
in it but it will be
your line of defense.

00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:44.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:46.263 align:middle line:84%
So let's say -- let's say
we're still eating maybe a half

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:49.600 align:middle line:84%
conscious, half unconscious diet
and now we're going to be --

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.736 align:middle line:84%
ideally we're taking in some of
these naturally fermented foods

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:54.471 align:middle line:84%
but let's say we don't
even want to go that far --

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.739 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Sure.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:57.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: -- and
we want to go to the store

00:42:57.007 --> 00:42:58.242 align:middle line:84%
and we want to find a pill
that says probiotic on it

00:42:58.242 --> 00:42:59.443 align:middle line:90%
and maybe even go

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:01.345 align:middle line:84%
to the refrigerated
section that says probiotic.

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:04.815 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the more
conscious useful probiotics

00:43:04.815 --> 00:43:08.018 align:middle line:84%
that exist in, you know,
capsule or powdered Form?

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:08.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: All right.

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.754 align:middle line:90%
So baseline for supplements.

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:13.357 align:middle line:84%
Avoid anything with
magnesium stearate in it.

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:14.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:43:14.658 --> 00:43:17.094 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Avoid
anything that is a major,

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:19.496 align:middle line:90%
major brand like Now Foods.

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:20.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:43:20.864 --> 00:43:22.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I'm sure
I'll get some flak for that.

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:25.669 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is
basically a store brand.

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:26.503 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:27.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: CVS brand.

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:28.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:28.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Anything like that.

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.240 align:middle line:90%
Walgreen's.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.409 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that there's
no titanium elements on it.

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:33.777 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the ingredients
are very simple.

00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:35.179 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It should
really just be probiotics maybe

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.750 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of vegetable
glycerin for any reason of --

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:41.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
manufacturing and that's it.

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:42.553 align:middle line:90%
Latero Flora.

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:43.687 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:44.855 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- is a universal brand.

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:45.956 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:46.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
That's what I take.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.358 align:middle line:90%
That's what I --

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- would use.

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:50.127 align:middle line:84%
You take it in the
morning before you eat

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:50.995 align:middle line:90%
with your lemon water.

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.329 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:53.564 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
then during the 45 minute wait

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:55.366 align:middle line:84%
period, 30 to 45 minute wait
period between the water

00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:57.835 align:middle line:84%
and eating anyway, you're
supposed to wait 20 minutes

00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:58.602 align:middle line:90%
with the Latero Flora.

00:43:58.602 --> 00:43:59.837 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
you take it in the morning,

00:44:01.105 --> 00:44:02.206 align:middle line:84%
three in the morning or if
you're severely deficient

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:04.575 align:middle line:84%
and your mind is
all over the place

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.443 align:middle line:84%
and you don't know what
to do, take a bunch.

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:07.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You know.

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:08.912 align:middle line:84%
Take more than the
suggested amount.

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:09.847 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad.

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.215 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's probiotic
bacteria.

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:12.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I think
some people think oh but what

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:15.152 align:middle line:84%
if I end up with diarrhea
and I have to go to work.

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:15.953 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: No.

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:16.987 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't really happen.

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:17.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
I know it doesn't,

00:44:17.688 --> 00:44:18.989 align:middle line:90%
I'm just bringing it up.

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.324 align:middle line:84%
There are people concerned
about that and so I just --

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.525 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You
don't have to worry about that.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: --
want you to address that.

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.327 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:24.094 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
worry about that.

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:25.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:26.096 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
And another thing is too,

00:44:26.096 --> 00:44:26.897 align:middle line:90%
like for a liver cleanse --

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:27.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:28.298 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:44:28.298 --> 00:44:29.633 align:middle line:90%
it's highly suggested

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:30.667 align:middle line:84%
that during a liver cleanse
you take a bolstering amount

00:44:30.667 --> 00:44:32.069 align:middle line:90%
of probiotic bacteria.

00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:33.303 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:34.672 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Because what's happening is

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:37.241 align:middle line:84%
when you're detoxifying your
body, your liver is releasing --

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:37.941 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:42.513 align:middle line:84%
the toxic accumulations into the
body and guess what has to get

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:45.182 align:middle line:84%
in and take care of that, I
mean it's the probiotic activity

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:46.583 align:middle line:84%
in your body and the
enzymes and everything

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:48.218 align:middle line:90%
like that, the baseline defense.

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:50.354 align:middle line:84%
So no matter how you splice
it, if you're detoxing,

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:52.056 align:middle line:84%
if you're eating garbage,
if you're eating great,

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:53.824 align:middle line:90%
you need probiotics period.

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
I'm telling you that's going

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.995 align:middle line:84%
to be the new wave of
natural health science

00:44:57.995 --> 00:44:59.163 align:middle line:90%
in the coming years.

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:01.932 align:middle line:84%
They're going to say
probiotics are the answer

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:04.334 align:middle line:84%
and the mainstream medical
establishment is going to say

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:05.569 align:middle line:90%
that nutrition means nothing.

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:06.403 align:middle line:90%
Continue it.

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:07.771 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Of course.

00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:08.739 align:middle line:84%
Of course because that pretty
much invalidates your whole

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:11.442 align:middle line:90%
field of antibiotics etc., etc.

00:45:11.442 --> 00:45:13.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
not to say that sometimes --

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.079 align:middle line:84%
not to say that if
you're, you know,

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:16.013 align:middle line:90%
suffering from a horrible --

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:17.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: No.

00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:18.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
bacterial infection --

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.016 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Sometimes you need --

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:20.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:21.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
-- to have antibiotics

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.586 align:middle line:84%
but I'm saying is this is
the first line of defense

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:23.520 align:middle line:84%
in medicine rather than
the last line of defense.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.855 align:middle line:90%
That's the issue.

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:25.522 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And you
can take this while you're

00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:26.323 align:middle line:90%
taking antibiotics.

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:26.857 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.125 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:29.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It
doesn't interrupt them at all.

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:30.294 align:middle line:84%
You should take excessive
amounts

00:45:30.294 --> 00:45:31.328 align:middle line:90%
when you're taking antibiotics.

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:32.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
I have done that.

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:36.066 align:middle line:84%
And it does help avoid some
of the other side effects

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.534 align:middle line:84%
of taking antibiotics
when I had to take them.

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:39.937 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
an interesting fact as well.

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:41.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:42.439 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Garlic has been found

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:46.443 align:middle line:84%
to kill antibiotic resistant
bacteria way more effectively

00:45:46.443 --> 00:45:49.480 align:middle line:84%
than antibiotics and in fact
there was even a prominent

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.383 align:middle line:84%
researcher who went and did the
study and he was saying like,

00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:55.252 align:middle line:84%
you know, garlic can
really be the answer

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:58.622 align:middle line:84%
to antibiotic resistant bacteria
because of the way that it goes

00:45:58.622 --> 00:46:01.592 align:middle line:84%
in and it doesn't develop
resistances to garlic.

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:02.593 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.293 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Garlic just goes

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.361 align:middle line:90%
in and just crushes it.

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking a
couple cloves a day.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:07.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Just natural, fresh.

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:08.832 align:middle line:90%
Because a lot of people --

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:11.268 align:middle line:84%
again when that first came
out about ten years ago,

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:14.471 align:middle line:84%
garlic can do this, people
started buying pills.

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:15.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: No.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.273 align:middle line:90%
Not a good idea with garlic.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.708 align:middle line:90%
Probiotics, sure.

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:18.842 align:middle line:90%
But garlic?

00:46:18.842 --> 00:46:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're looking at
a food that's healing.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.212 align:middle line:90%
We're not looking at extracts.

00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:24.248 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are
certain sulfur related --

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:25.382 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: That's
what I was going to ask, yeah.

00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:26.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- compounds.

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.418 align:middle line:84%
There are sulfur related
compounds inside of garlic

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that are thought to
be the reason for it.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.422 align:middle line:84%
But it's kind of like
when we look at Vitamin D

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:34.424 align:middle line:84%
when they take it into a
pill form of Vitamin D2

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:38.195 align:middle line:84%
and they say it's the same thing
as the sun related Vitamin D.

00:46:38.195 --> 00:46:39.730 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to take
Vitamin D by the way,

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.664 align:middle line:90%
make sure it's Vitamin D3.

00:46:40.664 --> 00:46:41.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: 3.

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:42.332 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:43.333 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Natural version.

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:44.735 align:middle line:84%
But they take Vitamin
D2 and they're

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:46.436 align:middle line:84%
like oh it's the same thing and
then of course it's really toxic

00:46:46.436 --> 00:46:49.039 align:middle line:84%
on all of the organs
and your body hates it.

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:51.408 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend -- why
not just eat garlic anyway.

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:52.676 align:middle line:90%
[laughter] I mean, you know.

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:53.977 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: But aren't
there some people onions

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:56.480 align:middle line:84%
and garlic that whatever the
compound maybe the sulfurs

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.284 align:middle line:84%
compound in it actually
creates not only intestinal

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:04.254 align:middle line:84%
and digestive disturbances
but even energetic.

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:04.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:06.156 align:middle line:90%
It's possible.

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:10.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean garlic is a pretty strong
food but at the same time,

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.897 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know somebody who's
very sensitive to everything.

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:16.833 align:middle line:84%
They can't eat certain spices
or they'll just throw up.

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:17.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:18.902 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
But what happens is

00:47:18.902 --> 00:47:20.237 align:middle line:84%
when you combine
garlic in something

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:21.605 align:middle line:90%
like a bountiful salad --

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:22.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:47:22.839 --> 00:47:23.607 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
with a number of vegetables

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:24.808 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that,

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:26.176 align:middle line:84%
that kind of cancel it
out, like a sweet pepper.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: To blunt it.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:27.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:28.879 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:29.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
It's actually easy

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.848 align:middle line:90%
to digest at that point.

00:47:30.848 --> 00:47:34.084 align:middle line:84%
Also, you might want to
examine your probiotic content

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:34.918 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:36.053 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Oh I see.

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: If
you can't digest garlic.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:37.955 align:middle line:84%
If you can't digest
anything, really --

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:38.889 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Raw onions

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.190 align:middle line:84%
and raw garlic for
a lot of people.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- you
might want to consider --

00:47:41.458 --> 00:47:43.093 align:middle line:84%
because I'll tell you something,
when I had Lyme disease

00:47:43.093 --> 00:47:44.995 align:middle line:84%
and I was given steroids
ultimately I was given

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:46.597 align:middle line:84%
antibiotics at a
certain point --

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:47.598 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:48.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- and for --

00:47:48.832 --> 00:47:49.933 align:middle line:84%
when I was very young I
had multiple ear infections

00:47:49.933 --> 00:47:51.235 align:middle line:84%
and I was brought to
the mainstream doctor

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:53.003 align:middle line:84%
who gave me antibiotics
every time.

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:56.139 align:middle line:84%
I was on antibiotics for
years, pretty much everyday.

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.474 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:47:57.474 --> 00:47:58.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
when I grew a little bit older

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:01.812 align:middle line:84%
and I started eating raw
foods, I couldn't digest them.

00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:05.082 align:middle line:84%
If I had a banana or
if I had a raw tomato

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:06.884 align:middle line:84%
or anything I couldn't
digest it.

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:07.985 align:middle line:90%
I would get acid coming up.

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:10.821 align:middle line:84%
I had horrible acid
reflux type symptoms.

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:12.089 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:12.889 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It
wasn't really even acid reflux.

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:14.258 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:15.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I can't
tell you exactly what it was

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:17.928 align:middle line:84%
but the antibiotics went in,
destroyed all the good bacteria

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:21.398 align:middle line:84%
and destroyed the very
lining of the body --

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:22.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:23.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:24.201 align:middle line:84%
that what happens is
enzymes start coming

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:25.602 align:middle line:84%
out when it's being
digested and going

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:27.704 align:middle line:90%
down through the body processes.

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:29.172 align:middle line:90%
So I was so stripped of that.

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:31.808 align:middle line:84%
It's like coming in and ripping
the paint off of everything.

00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:32.876 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's coming in

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:35.479 align:middle line:84%
and destroying all
the regular processes

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:38.215 align:middle line:84%
but what happened was once
I started taking apple cider

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:40.684 align:middle line:84%
vinegar is another good one
that's full of probiotic --

00:48:40.684 --> 00:48:41.652 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:42.886 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- content.

00:48:42.886 --> 00:48:44.821 align:middle line:84%
I started taking probiotics,
eating fermented foods,

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:47.224 align:middle line:84%
I was able to digest
them perfectly fine.

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:50.560 align:middle line:84%
So if you have issues digesting
things that are Beyond,

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.829 align:middle line:84%
you know, anything even
food sensitivities.

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:54.264 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: That's
what I was just going to ask.

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.433 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people feel that
they're either sensitive to

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.568 align:middle line:84%
or allergic to so
many things now,

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.003 align:middle line:84%
is that because it's
the destruction

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:01.738 align:middle line:84%
of the beneficial
flora in our guts?

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:03.073 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It
happens to do with that.

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:04.708 align:middle line:84%
It also happens to
do with the fact

00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:07.911 align:middle line:84%
that in multiple vaccines they
use -- for example, I mean,

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:11.882 align:middle line:84%
they use pet related things in
vaccines and your body fights it

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:14.217 align:middle line:84%
and then they wonder why they're
allergic to various pets.

00:49:14.217 --> 00:49:15.519 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:16.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: The
same thing can be happening

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.121 align:middle line:84%
with the vaccinations in
the compounds that the --

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: I see.

00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:20.791 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
foods that they're related to.

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:23.460 align:middle line:84%
But also I think it's mostly due
to that probiotic deficiency --

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.594 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:25.829 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- because I was told

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:28.432 align:middle line:84%
that I had food sensitivities
to all these things

00:49:28.432 --> 00:49:29.433 align:middle line:90%
when I couldn't digest them

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:30.434 align:middle line:84%
and they told me
just don't eat them.

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:31.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:32.769 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Like
I have to eat raw stuff.

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:34.738 align:middle line:84%
They're like well you're
obviously sensitive to,

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:37.007 align:middle line:84%
you know, raw banana,
raw tomatoes, everything.

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:37.774 align:middle line:90%
Every raw item --

00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:39.009 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:40.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
ever and I just couldn't see

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:41.712 align:middle line:90%
that being acceptable.

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:44.181 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're created to
eat these raw foods --

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:45.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:46.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- I
cannot just say oh I'm sensitive

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.585 align:middle line:90%
to them, I can't have them.

00:49:48.585 --> 00:49:50.087 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to try
the probiotic thing

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.188 align:middle line:90%
and it worked out

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:53.056 align:middle line:84%
fine. Now I can digest
everything properly.

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:54.124 align:middle line:90%
So I would encourage everyone

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.992 align:middle line:84%
to really examine
their probiotic levels

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.394 align:middle line:90%
if that's the case.

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: No that's
really interesting especially

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:01.131 align:middle line:84%
if you have healing
allies such as garlic

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:02.699 align:middle line:90%
that your body can't handle.

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:03.734 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:04.534 align:middle line:84%
You know, it doesn't
really make sense.

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:05.635 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure that some people --

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:06.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well
you're -- Italian --

00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:07.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
really do have allergies.

00:50:07.537 --> 00:50:08.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: --

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:09.439 align:middle line:84%
Gucciardi, come on
you got to be Italian.

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:11.174 align:middle line:90%
Of course you can eat garlic.

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:11.975 align:middle line:90%
[laughter]

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.111 align:middle line:84%
I've never really had
a problem with garlic.

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.345 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] But for
some reason yeah,

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:16.780 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't eat anything
raw and I found out that --

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:18.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- it
really had to come down to --

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:19.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Interesting.

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:20.817 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:21.518 align:middle line:84%
probiotic activity and I
think that's the answer

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:22.319 align:middle line:90%
to a lot of the things.

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
People say --

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:25.655 align:middle line:84%
and they kind of use it
as a crutch sometimes

00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:27.991 align:middle line:84%
like I have a food
sensitivity to blah, blah, blah,

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:29.326 align:middle line:90%
everything in that category.

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.294 align:middle line:84%
I have a food sense -- someone
told me they were allergic

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:33.363 align:middle line:84%
to vegetables and fruits
so what should I do?

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.165 align:middle line:84%
[laughter] Well I would
really question that.

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:35.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:36.833 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:37.801 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
would really question that.

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:38.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
The guts have

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:39.403 align:middle line:90%
to be shut down pretty much.

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:40.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:41.872 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well I
have to say, I mean a lot

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:42.939 align:middle line:84%
of people -- and I think
it happens more as we age

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.441 align:middle line:84%
because we've been
exposed to more toxins

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:46.843 align:middle line:84%
if we have poor eating
habits and so forth is

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:49.045 align:middle line:90%
that we have leaky gut.

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:50.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
That's an epidemic.

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:52.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yes.

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Leaky gut
is an epidemic and people are --

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.152 align:middle line:84%
their blood panels are coming
out saying that they're allergic

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:57.587 align:middle line:84%
to this and allergic to that
because the antibodies are there

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:59.856 align:middle line:84%
but that's because the stuff's
leaking out from their guts

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:03.226 align:middle line:84%
into their system
and I know I went

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:04.127 align:middle line:90%
through that a few years ago.

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:05.195 align:middle line:90%
It was so suddenly.

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:06.997 align:middle line:84%
Never had any allergies
in my whole life.

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:10.400 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly allergic to this
whole common panel of things

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.403 align:middle line:84%
and I went ahead and
through some processes

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:17.707 align:middle line:84%
of some certain enzymes and
also through with a glutamine

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:19.443 align:middle line:90%
and such and healed my guts up.

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.243 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:21.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:22.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: And so
I wasn't actually allergic

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:23.947 align:middle line:90%
to any of those things.

00:51:23.947 --> 00:51:26.683 align:middle line:84%
It was just a matter
of leaky gut syndrome.

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.285 align:middle line:84%
So maybe talk about
that for a second.

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:29.486 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:30.487 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: That's
a big one and important.

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:31.288 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
And you say that

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.189 align:middle line:90%
and I found the same thing.

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:33.857 align:middle line:90%
I mean I have a dog now.

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:34.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:36.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
But when I was a kid,

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:39.062 align:middle line:84%
I could never have a dog because
as soon as I was near a dog

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:42.933 align:middle line:84%
or a cat my eyes would become
horribly red my nose would run.

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.835 align:middle line:84%
I would sneeze and I
would just, you know, cry.

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:45.969 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I was like very little.

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.473 align:middle line:84%
But now I have a dog
and I have no problems.

00:51:49.473 --> 00:51:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Well why is that?

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:52.676 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what happened?

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.945 align:middle line:84%
Well what happened was a few
years ago I did the same thing

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:56.046 align:middle line:90%
as you did and I decided --

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:58.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
to take charge of my life

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.216 align:middle line:84%
as everyone listening
can do right now

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:00.650 align:middle line:84%
and overcome pretty
much anything.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.553 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is definitely
as you're saying it turns

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.921 align:middle line:90%
into an immune response.

00:52:04.921 --> 00:52:08.024 align:middle line:84%
How your body handles things
is determined by what you put

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:10.961 align:middle line:84%
into it and how you
want to handle it.

00:52:10.961 --> 00:52:12.195 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.296 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
mean, really if you're going

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.764 align:middle line:84%
to have a defeatist
attitude, that you know,

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:16.800 align:middle line:84%
I can't ever have a pet
again, or I'm allergic

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.169 align:middle line:84%
to these certain foods and
I can never eat them again,

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:22.372 align:middle line:84%
versus putting the probiotic
content into your body --

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:23.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:52:23.573 --> 00:52:24.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
taking charge of your gut.

00:52:24.674 --> 00:52:25.642 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
That makes total sense

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:27.043 align:middle line:84%
because what happens
instead in a lot

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:28.912 align:middle line:84%
of situations is people will say
oh jeez I'm gluten intolerant,

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.881 align:middle line:84%
and egg intolerant,
peanut intolerant

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:34.251 align:middle line:84%
and all these different things,
these intolerances so they buy,

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:38.021 align:middle line:84%
you know, a gallon size
of Tums or Rolaids.

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:39.122 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right.

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:41.725 align:middle line:84%
Right. [laughter] And
how about antacids?

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
That's what I'm saying.

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.527 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:44.661 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: They
go and destroy the acid

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:48.131 align:middle line:84%
in your stomach which is
what you need to digest

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:52.969 align:middle line:84%
and the people also that
are saying that you --

00:52:52.969 --> 00:52:54.704 align:middle line:90%
acid reflux Is too much acid --

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:55.939 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:56.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
it goes against everything.

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:58.308 align:middle line:84%
It goes against the
basic principle

00:52:58.308 --> 00:52:59.743 align:middle line:84%
that you need more
acid to digest.

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:00.510 align:middle line:90%
You need more enzymes --

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:01.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:02.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- and
everything to digest the food.

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:03.713 align:middle line:90%
Too much is not the issue.

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:04.781 align:middle line:90%
Too much bad bacteria --

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:05.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:06.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.118 align:middle line:84%
is the issue but not enough is
usually the issue for the gut.

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:10.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So if
you're doing a spectrum

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:15.392 align:middle line:84%
of the fermented foods
doing probiotics,

00:53:15.392 --> 00:53:18.528 align:middle line:84%
does it also restore
digestive function?

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:21.898 align:middle line:84%
I'll just -- in terms of
your -- as you get older,

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:24.000 align:middle line:84%
hydrochloric acid and
such starts decreasing

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.037 align:middle line:84%
and as you say cold water
and these various things

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:30.574 align:middle line:84%
and antacids and such reduce
it even further the ability --

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:31.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Oh yeah.

00:53:31.541 --> 00:53:32.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
-- to digest.

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:33.777 align:middle line:84%
Will the fermented
foods actually aid

00:53:33.777 --> 00:53:36.780 align:middle line:84%
in rebuilding the digestive
function of the body?

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.681 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:38.882 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:39.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
mean just in the same way

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:40.517 align:middle line:90%
that cold water destroys it --

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:41.651 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:42.852 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
probiotics build it up.

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:44.221 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: So
if you had little pickles

00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.089 align:middle line:84%
like the Germans, if you had
some pickles at the beginning

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:48.358 align:middle line:84%
of the meal, not necessarily
super sweet pickles either,

00:53:48.358 --> 00:53:49.159 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: I mean
but pickles in general.

00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:54.264 align:middle line:84%
Or a little bit of sauerkraut
and the Asian table, the kimchi.

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:57.200 align:middle line:84%
All these little
fermented foods fed first.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.436 align:middle line:84%
That sounds to me like it's
one of the smartest ways

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:02.439 align:middle line:84%
that we can accustom
our taste buds to it.

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:03.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Right.

00:54:03.406 --> 00:54:04.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
To start a meal.

00:54:04.541 --> 00:54:05.175 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Or mix it in to stuff.

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:06.142 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:06.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Or mix it in.

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:07.711 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:08.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
can't stand the taste --

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:09.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:10.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- of some of it --

00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:11.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:12.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- so I mix it in.

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:13.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Okay.

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.851 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Or
everyone worst case scenario,

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:15.919 align:middle line:84%
you know, you can't stand the
taste of Kombucha or something

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:16.853 align:middle line:84%
like that, which I
find hard to believe.

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:17.687 align:middle line:84%
Everyone seems to
really like it.

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.155 align:middle line:90%
Mix it in with some juice.

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:20.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:21.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You
know, take some apple juice,

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:24.661 align:middle line:84%
freshly made through
your juicer, mix it in.

00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:25.595 align:middle line:90%
Mix in the actual --

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Good idea.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:27.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
fermentation of the Kombucha

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.232 align:middle line:90%
and put it into the apple juice.

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.033 align:middle line:90%
You drink it.

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:31.101 align:middle line:90%
You won't taste it.

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:32.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You'll,
you know, maybe feel it go

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.138 align:middle line:84%
down because it is a
little fermented --

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:35.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.143 align:middle line:84%
leaf thing but when you drink it
the affects will still be there.

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:41.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Well the
other thing is Kombucha can be a

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:43.079 align:middle line:90%
little expensive.

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.781 align:middle line:84%
The really good stuff can
be a little expensive.

00:54:44.781 --> 00:54:45.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: You
can make your own though.

00:54:45.548 --> 00:54:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:47.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
If cost is an issue,

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.685 align:middle line:90%
you can make your Kombucha.

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: But
what I'm saying is if you --

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.722 align:middle line:84%
even if you're getting the
bottled stuff even if it is

00:54:52.722 --> 00:54:55.325 align:middle line:84%
like $5 a bottle and you
have to have, you know,

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:57.627 align:middle line:84%
ideally you drink a
bottle a day, as you say,

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:59.629 align:middle line:84%
you can break it down two
or three times and put it

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:01.564 align:middle line:84%
in little vegetable juice
or fruit juice or whatnot --

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:02.699 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Exactly.

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: --
and make it work for you

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.801 align:middle line:90%
without spending a fortune.

00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:07.203 align:middle line:84%
If you cap it back up and
leave some til the next day.

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:08.004 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:08.772 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Exactly.

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.106 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:11.074 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I mean,
here's how Kombucha works.

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:12.042 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
liquid and generally

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:14.744 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom is
the fermented plant.

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:16.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:17.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And you
can take some of that plant

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:19.516 align:middle line:84%
like you're saying and put it in
your daily juice in the morning

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:20.617 align:middle line:90%
and then -- you don't even have

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:22.619 align:middle line:84%
to drink the liquids
if you don't want to.

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.554 align:middle line:90%
The benefits are still there.

00:55:24.554 --> 00:55:27.824 align:middle line:84%
Or even just throwing in
any type of fermented food

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.426 align:middle line:90%
into a mixture of something.

00:55:29.426 --> 00:55:31.594 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
necessarily taste it to even,

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:34.097 align:middle line:90%
you know, enjoy the benefits.

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:35.932 align:middle line:84%
Or even a probiotic
supplement in the morning.

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:37.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:38.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
mean sometimes my routine --

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:40.337 align:middle line:84%
I try to not take
really any supplements --

00:55:40.337 --> 00:55:41.671 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:42.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- to
try to get it all from food,

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:43.606 align:middle line:90%
which is a challenge these days.

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.574 align:middle line:84%
But in the morning take
some Latero Flora --

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:45.809 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
have your water with lemon,

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:51.648 align:middle line:84%
enjoy your juice as your
first meal during the process

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:54.551 align:middle line:84%
or your body's process of
removing the toxic substances

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:55.385 align:middle line:90%
in the very morning --

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:56.086 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.355 align:middle line:84%
which is what happens and
you drink the juice typically

00:55:59.355 --> 00:56:02.792 align:middle line:84%
vegetable or fruit then you
know what happens is your day is

00:56:02.792 --> 00:56:03.560 align:middle line:90%
started off --

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:05.562 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- completely better.

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:06.896 align:middle line:84%
And we can go throughout
the day.

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:09.632 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you're drinking water
that is powerfully charged

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.668 align:middle line:90%
through a purified system,

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:14.137 align:middle line:84%
you can get a good water
purification system --

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:15.105 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to drop any names

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:16.306 align:middle line:84%
because I have no
affiliations --

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:18.141 align:middle line:84%
but you can get a good
water purification system

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:20.176 align:middle line:84%
that gets rid of fluoride,
gets rid of the heavy metals,

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:21.177 align:middle line:90%
gets rid of the chlorine,

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:22.912 align:middle line:84%
gets rid of the bacteria
for 200 bucks.

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:24.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:26.082 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I mean,
if you buy bottled water,

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:28.118 align:middle line:84%
you're spending thousands
a year most likely.

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.452 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Especially
if you have a big family.

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.488 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:32.789 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
the bottled water is crap.

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:35.058 align:middle line:84%
I mean it's most likely tap
water that's been filtered

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:38.228 align:middle line:84%
which means nothing as we talked
about or it's been purified

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.964 align:middle line:84%
which is better but then
the bottled water has BPA --

00:56:40.964 --> 00:56:41.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:42.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- in it.

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:45.835 align:middle line:84%
It leeches into the water
and that's been known --

00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:49.038 align:middle line:84%
over 130 studies show it's
causing breast cancer.

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.943 align:middle line:84%
Okay. We have about five minutes
left so anything else in terms

00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:55.745 align:middle line:84%
of the things that you
feel are really critical.

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:58.081 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
Nascent Iodine early on.

00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:01.818 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about the -- all
of the effects of probiotics

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:05.789 align:middle line:84%
of all kinds, detoxing to
get the crap that has gotten

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:09.626 align:middle line:84%
into our bodies over the
decades out in a gentle fashion.

00:57:09.626 --> 00:57:12.862 align:middle line:84%
So what else do you do and do
you like to focus on in some

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.731 align:middle line:84%
of your other shows
and your articles.

00:57:14.731 --> 00:57:15.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Sure.

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.734 align:middle line:84%
So one thing too is get
a baseline shower filter.

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.035 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:20.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Even
if it's a $20 shower filter.

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:21.538 align:middle line:90%
It's very challenging --

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:24.174 align:middle line:84%
if you have the money you
can get a household filter --

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:25.441 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:57:25.441 --> 00:57:26.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
which gets rid of everything.

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.410 align:middle line:90%
Gets rid of the fluoride

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.078 align:middle line:84%
and everything even before
it comes into your faucet.

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:30.814 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
I mean that's ideal.

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.081 align:middle line:90%
That is pristine.

00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:34.818 align:middle line:84%
That removes virtually all
the toxins from the water.

00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:37.187 align:middle line:84%
But a baseline shower filter
even if it's 20 bucks,

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.355 align:middle line:84%
even if it's 50 bucks,
it's good.

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:40.190 align:middle line:90%
Put it onto your shower.

00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:41.558 align:middle line:90%
It gets rid of the chlorine.

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:45.461 align:middle line:84%
It gets rid of the negative
compounds that are in the water.

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:47.931 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it even gets
rid of the radiation

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.265 align:middle line:90%
that may be lurking --

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:50.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.167 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
-- in your water supply.

00:57:51.167 --> 00:57:52.302 align:middle line:90%
Houston had radiation.

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:54.604 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting rid
of thousands of toxins

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:56.573 align:middle line:84%
and let's say for example
you have a threshold

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:58.208 align:middle line:84%
of a certain hundreds
of thousands

00:57:58.208 --> 00:58:00.777 align:middle line:84%
of toxins per day
well you're reducing

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:02.412 align:middle line:84%
that amount just
by a shower filter.

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:03.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And in your toothpaste buy
a fluoride free toothpaste

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:08.852 align:middle line:84%
preferably organic,
very hard to find.

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.220 align:middle line:90%
So not a huge issue.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.689 align:middle line:84%
But if it doesn't have
any artificial sweeteners,

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:16.025 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have any titanium,
doesn't have any Triclosan,

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:18.728 align:middle line:84%
which is used in hand
soap which is a derivative

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:20.630 align:middle line:84%
of an agent orange
type chemical,

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:22.999 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have any
sodium Laurel sulfate,

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:25.902 align:middle line:84%
which gives you canker sores
and devastates your health.

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:27.937 align:middle line:84%
So you buy toothpaste
that's clean

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:30.073 align:middle line:90%
and you use water that's clean.

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:31.274 align:middle line:84%
Or for example, let's
say you're forced

00:58:31.274 --> 00:58:34.277 align:middle line:84%
to brush your teeth
without a filter.

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:36.412 align:middle line:84%
My bathroom doesn't
have a filter.

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:37.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:58:37.213 --> 00:58:37.881 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Okay.

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:39.282 align:middle line:90%
I can't afford that.

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:42.619 align:middle line:84%
So I have the toothpaste and I
just brush and I rinse my mouth

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:45.288 align:middle line:84%
out with a glass
of purified water.

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:46.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:47.056 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Real simple.

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:58:48.124 --> 00:58:49.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Takes two seconds.

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.526 align:middle line:84%
No exposure to the
fluoride whatsoever

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:53.129 align:middle line:84%
and the toothpaste is clean so
what's happening, believe it

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:56.032 align:middle line:84%
or not, dentists
are recommending --

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.166 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
patients a fluoride --

00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:58:59.235 --> 00:58:59.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --
because they say they're

00:58:59.903 --> 00:59:01.004 align:middle line:90%
fluoride deficient.

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.138 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Oh
I know, we talked --

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:03.072 align:middle line:84%
I talked with Mike Adams
for an hour about this.

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.407 align:middle line:90%
This is ridiculous.

00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:05.608 align:middle line:90%
Continue.

00:59:05.608 --> 00:59:06.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Well
it might have been based

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.444 align:middle line:84%
on my video because I made
this first video about this.

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.445 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:10.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
The toothpaste

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:12.849 align:middle line:84%
with 10,000 parts per
million which is 500,000% more

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:13.750 align:middle line:90%
than the drinking water --

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:16.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- which
Harvard research shows leads

00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:17.587 align:middle line:84%
to decreased IQ across
the board --

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:59:18.955 --> 00:59:19.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- and
damages children in the womb.

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So 10,000
parts per million will cause

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:23.493 align:middle line:90%
brain damage instantly.

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.894 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Right.

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:26.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So when
people have these toothpastes

00:59:26.095 --> 00:59:27.997 align:middle line:90%
and I found one there's a video,

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:30.667 align:middle line:84%
I made it of the
dentist told the girl

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.035 align:middle line:90%
that she was fluoride deficient

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:33.903 align:middle line:84%
and needed the 10,000 parts
per million toothpaste

00:59:33.903 --> 00:59:36.873 align:middle line:84%
which she used for six months
and I can only imagine what

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:37.974 align:middle line:90%
that did to her brain.

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Literally probably just
devastated her IQ --

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:41.811 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: It's so sad.

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:42.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
It's horrible.

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:45.315 align:middle line:84%
500,000 times --
percent more than what's

00:59:45.315 --> 00:59:46.616 align:middle line:90%
in the water right now.

00:59:46.616 --> 00:59:47.917 align:middle line:90%
So get rid of all the fluoride.

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:49.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Buy
baseline USDA organic baseline.

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:52.188 align:middle line:90%
It does mean something.

00:59:52.188 --> 00:59:53.389 align:middle line:90%
We talked about it last hour.

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:54.223 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:59:54.223 --> 00:59:55.291 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: People,

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.192 align:middle line:84%
you know give it crap
and say it's bad.

00:59:56.192 --> 00:59:57.226 align:middle line:90%
It's not perfect.

00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:58.294 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:59.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
But it's better --

00:59:59.128 --> 00:59:59.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:01.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:01.831 align:middle line:84%
than the contaminants you're
getting in your foods.

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:02.632 align:middle line:90%
So baseline USDA organic.

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.033 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.635 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: If you can
get 100% organic wild crafted

01:00:05.635 --> 01:00:08.871 align:middle line:84%
type stuff, go for it,
but baseline organic.

01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:11.007 align:middle line:84%
And even Whole Foods
has a purified water

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.542 align:middle line:90%
through reverse osmosis.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yes.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:14.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: And
if you get that it's good.

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
And most stores do.

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:17.847 align:middle line:84%
Most health food stores do
have a machine these days.

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:18.614 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:19.816 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:20.616 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
It's better to get that --

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:21.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.553 align:middle line:84%
and also if you skimp on
some money now to your food,

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.188 align:middle line:90%
if you save ten bucks a week

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:28.758 align:middle line:84%
or whatever buying bottled water
instead well the medical bills

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:32.562 align:middle line:84%
alone for when you have a
devastating chronic disease --

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:33.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:00:33.262 --> 01:00:34.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: --

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:35.598 align:middle line:84%
will trump anything
that you're saving --

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:36.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:38.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- from
buying lower quality foods.

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:38.868 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee you that.

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:39.836 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.237 align:middle line:84%
We have just a minute
or so left.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:43.906 align:middle line:84%
Multivitamins, people
look at multivitamins,

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:48.511 align:middle line:84%
again same advice I assume,
don't look at anything that is

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:50.279 align:middle line:84%
from a major brand
that's cheap that's

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:54.317 align:middle line:84%
on the grocery store shelves
in general and whole foods

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.652 align:middle line:90%
and go with whole foods?

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:57.954 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: I
would -- yeah, whole foods --

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.789 align:middle line:84%
ideally from foods -- I
thought you meant the store.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:00.623 align:middle line:90%
No. [laughter]

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:01.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: No, no, no.

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.125 align:middle line:90%
Whole food's vitamins.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:02.759 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:03.993 align:middle line:90%
Ideally from food

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.895 align:middle line:84%
but if anything a liquid
multivitamin that's mineral

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:06.696 align:middle line:90%
based --

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- is
actually the best carbon bound.

01:01:09.032 --> 01:01:09.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Oh interesting.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:10.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

01:01:10.266 --> 01:01:11.467 align:middle line:90%
So --

01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.268 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Do you
like the flora products?

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:12.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: Yeah.

01:01:12.935 --> 01:01:14.337 align:middle line:90%
They're pretty good.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.338 align:middle line:84%
But I also something that was
intraMAX is an excellent choice.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: intraMAX.

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:16.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: intraMAX.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:17.707 align:middle line:90%
It's a carbon bound.

01:01:17.707 --> 01:01:18.608 align:middle line:90%
It's expensive.

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:19.942 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:20.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: It's
expensive but something similar

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:21.544 align:middle line:90%
to a liquid multivitamin --

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:22.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: -- is way
more absorbable by the body.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.016 align:middle line:84%
Or for example, you can get most
of your vitamins from juicing.

01:01:27.016 --> 01:01:28.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Um-hmm.

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:29.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: So
something to consider for there

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.087 align:middle line:84%
but the minerals are
important as well.

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.422 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.723 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: That's
a whole another topic there

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.224 align:middle line:84%
but the minerals you need on
a daily basis can be taken

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:38.127 align:middle line:84%
from food but there are a
number of liquid supplements

01:01:38.127 --> 01:01:39.495 align:middle line:90%
that can help with that.

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Give us your
favorite before we sign off.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:41.798 align:middle line:90%
>> Anthony Gucciardi: intraMAX.

01:01:41.798 --> 01:01:42.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
Still intraMAX.

01:01:42.598 --> 01:01:43.166 align:middle line:90%
Okay. [laughter] All right.

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.567 align:middle line:90%
intraMAX it is.

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:45.868 align:middle line:84%
Anthony I want to
thank you so much.

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.236 align:middle line:90%
You're a walking encyclopedia.

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:51.574 align:middle line:84%
I am so excited that you are
here and speaking not only to

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:55.411 align:middle line:84%
but for your generation to
the generations before you

01:01:55.411 --> 01:01:57.447 align:middle line:84%
that are basing -- have
created all these troubles

01:01:57.447 --> 01:02:00.283 align:middle line:84%
and you guys what I love
about you guys is you'll go

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:05.388 align:middle line:84%
to the extreme to find truth
and purity in your food

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:08.091 align:middle line:84%
and your information and
everything and then reflect

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.559 align:middle line:90%
that back to the rest of us.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.693 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for your efforts.

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:11.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Anthony Gucciardi:
Thank you very much.

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:33.816 align:middle line:90%
