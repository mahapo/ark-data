00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
Dr. Gerald Cohen

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
was a young man
in Jerusalem when

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:90%
his life took an abrupt turn.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Learning of an aged
scholar and healer, Gerald

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.640 align:middle line:84%
had the depth of curiosity
to follow a path of mysticism

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:90%
in his quest to heal.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.390 align:middle line:84%
This in turn, led to the
ancient works of others

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
that he found to
have profound truths.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Today, he incorporates
homeopathy, light therapy,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.230 align:middle line:84%
and other scientific
breakthroughs

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.990 align:middle line:84%
into his practice that
views the person as a soul

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:90%
first and a body second.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.193 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Gerald.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It's lovely to
speak to you again.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It's been a couple of years
since our last conversation.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.770 align:middle line:84%
And I can't tell you how
much I appreciate the fact

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that your philosophy allows
for the multi-dimensional being

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
to sit in front of
you for evaluation,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:90%
rather than just the body.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:10%
I mean that is qualitatively
a completely different way

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.330 align:middle line:10%
to look at healing.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.205 align:middle line:10%
>>GERALD COHEN: Thanks
so much for having me.

00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:22.120 align:middle line:10%
It's just a pleasure.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.790 align:middle line:10%
And the last one was
a great interview.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.630 align:middle line:10%
And I'm really looking
forward to this one.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.710 align:middle line:10%
Well, we're ready to roll.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.355 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
the times in Jerusalem

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:32.980 align:middle line:10%
because that was
quite a long time ago.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:90%
You were a young man.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, yeah.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.693 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I want to know where
your story really begins.

00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it even begins
before that, curiosity wise.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It actually
began in New York.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And I used to stay up all night
listening to the Long John

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.690 align:middle line:90%
Nebel show.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And he had on his show
guests that were just

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:90%
extremely profound.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And one of them was
a Tibetan teacher.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:90%
And he talked about meditation.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:90%
I was 14 years old.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:90%
And I stayed up all night.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:90%
It went from 10:00 to 5:00.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And I meditated along with them.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And I said I got to share
this with everybody.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:90%
This can really change people.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.485 align:middle line:84%
And so next day I was at
the park, in New York.

00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
bunch of people I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:84%
knew that were not the
nicest people in the world,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:90%
that I was friends with.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Rough teenagers.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you want
to try something cool?

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.088 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first
meditation class at 14.

00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That was gutsy.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean to take it
at 14, to think

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
that you had enough authority
to carry that forward,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.140 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: They liked me.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.775 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They liked
you, obviously.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.575 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They liked
my poetry also.

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:33.375 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:34.583 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's really neat.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing is
when did you ever sleep?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean how did you do
school during those years

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.267 align:middle line:84%
or were you living
on these fumes?

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I wasn't going
to school that much.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
I was passing exams--

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was fun
enough not have to show up.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: --and working
in a restaurant,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.240 align:middle line:84%
and going to Greenwich Village,
and hearing music, and hanging

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:90%
out with creative people.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.910 align:middle line:90%
But I did graduate.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.327 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did you,
yes, of course.

00:02:56.327 --> 00:02:58.582 align:middle line:84%
So you went on to-- how did
you end up in Jerusalem?

00:02:58.582 --> 00:03:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And what was it
that happened there

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.750 align:middle line:84%
that really changed
things for you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.790 align:middle line:84%
and turned you
more into a mystic

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.228 align:middle line:84%
before you even went through
the medical trainings?

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.020 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, I started
with the mysticism

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:84%
from listening to the show and
seeing the profound changes

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:84%
that I was working with
people already as a teenager.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How did
those guys in the park

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.828 align:middle line:84%
work out, by the way, after
you exposed them to meditation.

00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:19.497 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They stopped
stabbing people.

00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did they really?

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.663 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:21.663 --> 00:03:23.247 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And they
went along with it.

00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:24.658 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They went
along with it.

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's amazing.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And some of them
ended up in the mafia,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
and some of them
ended up in Vietnam,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:90%
and we lost a few of them.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.450 align:middle line:90%
But they were different people.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so
what happened was

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:90%
I broke up with my girlfriend.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:90%
I was 17 years old.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:90%
She was a lot older than me.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And she told me, go travel
the world for two years

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.155 align:middle line:84%
and come back and see if you
still want to be with me.

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so I
started to travel.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the places I
stopped in was Jerusalem.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And I put on a black
coat and a black hat.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And I pretended to
be an Orthodox Jew.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.160 align:middle line:84%
And I started to study in
a place called Yeshiva Mir.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I heard
about this ancient teacher.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
And one of the students
there told me about him.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said that he
gives lessons at night,

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.777 align:middle line:90%
but you have to fight to get in.

00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Literally?

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.652 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Literally fight.

00:04:16.652 --> 00:04:19.660 align:middle line:84%
People would punch to get
in because it was so--

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.900 align:middle line:90%
you get bruised.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: How strange is that?

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.050 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Oh, it was bizarre.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You had to
punch it out with others

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
to get into a spiritual
mysticism training.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.800 align:middle line:90%
He was 94 years old at the time.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And all his students
had been killed

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:90%
in the Holocaust in Poland.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.292 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And they somehow got
him out before that happened.

00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And so there wasn't many
teachers in that time.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Now, there are in Jerusalem.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so I
sat there with him.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.165 align:middle line:90%
And I struggled with his accent.

00:04:46.165 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:90%
But I got enough out of it.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.490 align:middle line:84%
And he beautifully explained
how an intention manifests

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
in reality, and
that whole process,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:90%
and how perfect it was.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from a thought
from God or a creator.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And it steps down into duality,
and then individuality,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:90%
and then action.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And that all the world is an
expression of that process,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.203 align:middle line:84%
called the etz chaim,
which is the tree of life.

00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Didn't you
tell me off camera,

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:84%
if I remember correctly, that
in Hebrew the word thought

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:90%
and thing--

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --is the same thing?

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.817 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: That's right.

00:05:20.817 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
In biblical Hebrew,
but non-biblical.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Biblical Hebrew,
yes, which makes sense

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.060 align:middle line:84%
because what you're
saying, which we now

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.650 align:middle line:84%
know is true, that thoughts
manifest into things.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And the quality of the
intention behind the thoughts

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.667 align:middle line:84%
is critical because if
your intention is off,

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:41.750 align:middle line:90%
your thoughts will be off.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.375 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts are when they
break down into duality,

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
but before that you have to
have the spiritual intention.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Uh-huh.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: So I used to go to
Mount Zion and meditate there.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I got up there,
there was a memorial

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:90%
to victims of the Holocaust.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I got the
thought that, wait a minute--

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
and I was still 17
years old at the time.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
what went wrong?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:90%
This is a perfect system.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what went wrong?

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Why do people treat
each other this way?

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:90%
What about this destruction?

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.743 align:middle line:84%
Why is there so much
disease and unhappiness?

00:06:19.743 --> 00:06:21.410 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing in
the plan that I heard

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.317 align:middle line:90%
from this old, ancient teacher.

00:06:23.317 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It has to be that way.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.450 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: It wasn't.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the design.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:27.830 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: The design is--

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a corrupted
program, so to speak.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.180 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Coming from us.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And so that's when
I came up with the question.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So if it's broken,
can it be repaired?

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And if it's broken,
is it broken inside us

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:90%
or is it broken as a society?

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.698 align:middle line:90%
And it was just a question.

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And nobody can answer
that question for me.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.765 align:middle line:84%
And that became the
direction of my life.

00:06:52.765 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
came in contact

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.100 align:middle line:84%
with another philosopher,
as I understand,

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.145 align:middle line:84%
that had a very
big impact on you.

00:06:58.145 --> 00:06:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Well, I was at Mt.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.433 align:middle line:90%
Zion during the same time.

00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And there was a
spiritual teacher.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea who he was.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.940 align:middle line:84%
But there was a long line
of people wanted to see him.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.740 align:middle line:90%
So I got on line.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:90%
I was the last one on line.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And I had no idea where he was.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You didn't have
to punch your way in anyway.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.218 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Nobody was punching.

00:07:13.218 --> 00:07:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was very polite.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.260 align:middle line:84%
And when he got to
me, he looked at me.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, don't spend
your life looking for answers.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Spend your life looking
for the right questions.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And that was the beginning
of a lifetime relationship,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.693 align:middle line:84%
until he died in '94,
where we became friends.

00:07:32.693 --> 00:07:33.860 align:middle line:90%
He became a teacher of mine.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
But he also became a patient
of mine, where I treated him

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.450 align:middle line:90%
over a long period of time.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Interestingly,
one of the things

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.530 align:middle line:84%
that fascinated me about you
is when we were talking off

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:90%
camera a couple years ago.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.380 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Yeah.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We were just casually
discussing some teachings

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.840 align:middle line:84%
that you also do, aside
from your medical work

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:90%
that you do with people.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And included in your
client base, and people

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.067 align:middle line:84%
who were attending your more
mystical workshops and such,

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
were two other people that
I've interviewed, that I have

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:90%
a great amount of respect for.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:84%
Both of them
physicists, and really

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.487 align:middle line:84%
searching for answers
from the same quantum soup

00:08:10.487 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Exactly.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when I realized
they were your students,

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.984 align:middle line:84%
I thought, uh-huh, I'd
better pay attention.

00:08:16.984 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.480 align:middle line:10%
So let's talk about
where you started

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:10%
going from the mystical
into the world of science

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:10%
and medical treatments
such as homeopathy

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.475 align:middle line:10%
because you started
with homeopathy long

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:31.100 align:middle line:10%
before most people
had ever heard of it

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.790 align:middle line:10%
in the United States.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>>COHEN: Right.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.392 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually homeopathy had
been here in the United States.

00:08:36.392 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Most people
just hadn't heard of it.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.289 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Most of it
they had forgotten.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.289 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They had
forgotten, yeah, that's true.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.340 align:middle line:84%
It was one out of five
physicians at one time

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.290 align:middle line:90%
were homeopathic physicians.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.772 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: I had the
fortune of meeting

00:08:46.772 --> 00:08:48.320 align:middle line:90%
some of the older homeopaths.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically
because homeopathy

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.770 align:middle line:90%
couldn't be patented.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And when medical
education became uniform,

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.350 align:middle line:84%
there was no funding
for postgraduate work

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.610 align:middle line:90%
with homeopathy.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.630 align:middle line:90%
So it started to disappear.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.610 align:middle line:90%
But it actually was never--

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:09.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was presidents
of the United States, Thomas

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Edison, said he couldn't
have invented anything

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.910 align:middle line:90%
without homeopathy.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:84%
There was a senator from
New York, Aaron Copland,

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.820 align:middle line:84%
that was a homeopathic
eye surgeon that

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
treated the president,
treated Calvin Coolidge,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:90%
and later became senate.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
homeopathic pharmacopeia

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:84%
was grandfathered in, because of
his work when he was a senator.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also
the royal family.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.792 align:middle line:84%
It's well known the
royal family in England

00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:36.557 align:middle line:84%
uses almost
exclusively homeopathy,

00:09:36.557 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:84%
unless someone has to be rushed
to the hospital for something.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.598 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: Well, the
palace physician

00:09:40.598 --> 00:09:42.620 align:middle line:84%
has always been a homeopath,
for over 200 years.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right, right.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.310 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: And they actually
had a woman, when I started,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:90%
that was a palace physician.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.710 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk about
how you became involved.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
What is it about homeopathy
that you find so profound

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.200 align:middle line:84%
and that intrigued
you to the extent you

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.738 align:middle line:84%
started embracing it and
folding it into your practice?

00:09:59.738 --> 00:10:01.280 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: There was
an instinct that I

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:84%
had that the whole world
was going into macro doses.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Explain that
a little bit more.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: They were
going into taking

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical substances
to suppress symptoms.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And I early figured out from my
work with Kabbalistic medicine

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and talking to a
lot of physicians

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.240 align:middle line:84%
and traveling around that
suppression is not the way

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
to go if you want to be
healthy and if you want

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.910 align:middle line:84%
to have a life that
expresses your own purpose

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.960 align:middle line:90%
and your authenticity.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So I felt there had
to be a better way.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.050 align:middle line:84%
And the homeopaths talk
about predispositions,

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
they're called miasms, that
we come into the world.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.670 align:middle line:84%
And during that time,
I came of the opinion

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.670 align:middle line:84%
that homeopathy was a derivative
of Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:84%
It was a simplification
into a medical field

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.189 align:middle line:90%
that happened in 1796.

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: With Hahnemann?

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Hahnemann was
familiar with 14 languages,

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.150 align:middle line:90%
including Hebrew.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:84%
So he would have had access
to that Gillian philosophy

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:84%
of breaking something
down to its core,

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:90%
and that resonated with me.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.850 align:middle line:84%
And I started spending
time with homeopaths

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and eventually went and did a
PhD in the UK in homeopathy.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, I realized
that the pharmacology of making

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:84%
homeopathic medicines was really
the same thing the old man was

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.230 align:middle line:84%
talking about, was how a thought
manifests into a substance.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And that you didn't need
the actual substance

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.122 align:middle line:90%
to carry the information.

00:11:37.122 --> 00:11:39.372 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And maybe this
is a good time to talk about

00:11:39.372 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:84%
the whole process of
potentization and so forth,

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:45.020 align:middle line:84%
so people understand that this
is water carrying information

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.530 align:middle line:90%
essentially, or a medium--

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, whatnot--
carrying information.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.530 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, it's all changed
recently because of a French

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:57.410 align:middle line:84%
scientist, Nobel Prize winner,
Montagnier who received

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.610 align:middle line:84%
the Nobel Prize for
virology, for medicine,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:90%
for discovering the AIDS virus.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And he came out recently,
a few years ago,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and they're using, in an
institute in Shanghai,

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.870 align:middle line:84%
China, funded by the
Chinese government,

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
they're finding that you don't
need the molecule-- exactly

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:90%
what the homeopath said.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:84%
That what you need
is the signal,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
and he's written
scientific papers called

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
"Ghost DNA" was one of the
ones that was really exciting.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Where the body keeps
producing the enzymes,

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
once it has the signal, even
though there's nothing physical

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
there left anymore.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said one thing that
got a lot of controversy.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, the homeopaths
got it right, and he said,

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter
of time before we

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:90%
get to the high dilutions.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And when he wrote the
paper, it was 10 to the 18th

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:51.680 align:middle line:84%
which is 1 to 100 billion,
I think which is exactly--

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.160 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about-- it's how
our nervous system works.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.550 align:middle line:84%
That our nervous system,
brain-derived neurotrophic

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:04.170 align:middle line:84%
factor, has to be in a 1 to 100
billion dilution or the nerves

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:90%
die.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Really?

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And so our own brain
is working homeopathically,

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is what
they're discovering.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
That the solutions to many
of the chronic diseases

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
that are induced by the
chemicals and the stresses

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.400 align:middle line:84%
of modern living, the solutions
will be in the high dilutions.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
of time before we

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.220 align:middle line:90%
can measure that high.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.908 align:middle line:90%
They have the technology.

00:13:26.908 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
so when you have a homeopathic

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.420 align:middle line:84%
substance, the
original substance,

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.840 align:middle line:84%
a little bit is put
into the base solution,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.390 align:middle line:84%
whether it's alcohol,
water, whatnot.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:37.730 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Yeah.

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And it's potentized.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:90%
It's shaken, shaken, shaken.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.608 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: No,
there's three things.

00:13:41.608 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: It's micro-reduced.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Serially reduced.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: It's trituration,
which means it's mixed,

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:84%
at a certain frequency,
and then it's succussed.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, what the
scientists found out

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.930 align:middle line:84%
that you can use a centrifuge
and get the same result.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.107 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to succuss.

00:14:01.107 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:90%
Succuss means the shaking.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Shake.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.020 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And Benveniste
in the 1980s, in "Nature"

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.810 align:middle line:84%
magazine found the same
thing with antibodies,

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:15.230 align:middle line:84%
the same thing that Montagnier
found in regular substances

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
which means that life
is just a thought.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's all
just information.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.768 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: I don't know about
if it's all information,

00:14:23.768 --> 00:14:29.060 align:middle line:84%
but how it explodes into
potential possibilities comes

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:84%
from the original intention of
the information that's given.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:37.520 align:middle line:10%
The Information is the process
of going through the different

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.330 align:middle line:10%
stages of existence and what
happened with me in homeopathy

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:10%
was I realized that
the homeopaths--

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:10%
though none of
homeopaths knew this--

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.460 align:middle line:10%
were actually making--
the whole process

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:10%
of making homeopathic
medicines was

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.470 align:middle line:10%
going through the
process of tree of life.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.150 align:middle line:84%
And the whole frequency
is the tree of life

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:84%
which is mathematics, and
so that's what I discovered.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
Kabbalistic alchemy, which

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:84%
is the spiritual component when
it's reduced through a step

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:09.320 align:middle line:84%
down process,
becomes homeopathic,

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:13.980 align:middle line:84%
so the spiritual aspect which
is the law of questions,

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.570 align:middle line:84%
which is why each one
comes into this world.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Each one has to operate from
their own question coming

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.870 align:middle line:90%
from the spiritual realm.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
When it steps down, it becomes
the mental, the emotional,

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.440 align:middle line:84%
and the physical, and if
we go through that process,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:84%
we can take experience and make
it into an entangled, elegant

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely,
and I think at this point,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.230 align:middle line:84%
just in the grossest sense, I
think it's important to impress

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:84%
upon our viewers that
aren't already familiar with

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
homeopathy and don't
already understand this,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.890 align:middle line:84%
the difference between taking
substance, gross substance,

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
and throwing it at an ailment
versus using these subtle

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.050 align:middle line:84%
frequencies, these
matrices of information,

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:02.780 align:middle line:84%
mathematics and such,
and injecting that

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.520 align:middle line:90%
into the condition.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.370 align:middle line:84%
Talk qualitatively
about why, because it

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
seems that less is
more, when it comes

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.200 align:middle line:84%
to homeopathy and this kind of
treatment of the human being.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.120 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, it's the
same thing with nutrition.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
The laws of nutrition are
very similar to the laws

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.800 align:middle line:84%
of homeopathy, that we should
eat things that our DNA knows

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.640 align:middle line:90%
what they are.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.410 align:middle line:84%
There's a big component
of individuality there.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and I want to
get into the nutrition part

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.940 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: But the idea is what
I've seen part of the insanity

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.750 align:middle line:84%
is people taking
macro-doses, large doses,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.722 align:middle line:84%
that history has no
familiarity, thinking that's--

00:16:41.722 --> 00:16:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This would be
pharmaceuticals, for example?

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:44.570 align:middle line:90%
Or anything?

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Food?

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:90%
Anything?

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: This would
be synthetic vitamins.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Synthetic
vita-- oh, interesting.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.230 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Adulterated herbs.

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Things that people
think are natural and healthy.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.678 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that
makes sense when you take

00:16:55.678 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
into consideration that you're
really getting only micro

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.480 align:middle line:84%
doses, when you're eating the
food whole and intact food.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Which unfortunately, there's
not a lot of intact food

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:84%
out there, unless you go to
anthroposophical gardening,

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:09.685 align:middle line:84%
biodynamics, and
that kind of thing.

00:17:09.685 --> 00:17:11.060 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the food
is fairly dead,

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
but let's say we
have a living food.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
It is feeding us absorbable
micro-doses of all

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.150 align:middle line:90%
of these vitamins and minerals.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.233 align:middle line:90%
That's what you're saying.

00:17:19.233 --> 00:17:22.400 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Right, and the only
time you should use large doses

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.910 align:middle line:84%
is if you have a disease,
and it's life-threatening.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Because then you want to
suppress that, keep somebody

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.740 align:middle line:84%
alive, and then
rehabilitate them

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.560 align:middle line:90%
gradually with micro-doses.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.120 align:middle line:90%
So that's the place for drugs.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Drugs save lives in
certain occasions.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:84%
They override our
bodies inability

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.680 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to poisons
and stressors,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and they might keep us alive,
if they're the right drugs.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
question that there's

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:84%
a place for
pharmaceutical medicines,

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and there is actually
a small place

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:57.920 align:middle line:84%
for some synthetic vitamins,
in certain occasions.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
But for general health
and general recovery,

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:84%
never give somebody
more than their body

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:90%
is designed to handle.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about
natural compounds,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
like whole food
vitamins, for example,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
where you're deriving it
from the foods themselves?

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.770 align:middle line:84%
Are those a little safer
to take on a daily basis?

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: If they're
really made out of food.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.375 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: That's what
we use in my practice.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.235 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Right,
if they really are.

00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:22.527 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: If they really are,
most of the thing is that

00:18:22.527 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:84%
there's food to added
to the synthetic,

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and they call it
whole food vitamins.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.988 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, that's a scam.

00:18:26.988 --> 00:18:28.495 align:middle line:84%
How do you find
out the difference?

00:18:28.495 --> 00:18:30.912 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: The only company I
know that actually does whole

00:18:30.912 --> 00:18:33.070 align:middle line:84%
food, and that's not
available in the stores,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and we use it as
Standard Process.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.383 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:18:35.383 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Standard Process,
they're a good company.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Yeah.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.163 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Standard
Process, oh, good.

00:18:39.163 --> 00:18:40.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm making this note.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And that starts
from the work of Royal Lee,

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
who is an engineer
and a scientist,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:54.110 align:middle line:84%
the idea that we had changed our
inner chemistry to a point we

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:middle line:90%
were actually starving to death.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:84%
That we started using
a civilized diet,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
which was basically
processed foods,

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:84%
which were causing people to
really go into malnutrition,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and so he started the
formulas to counteract that.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.810 align:middle line:84%
That as we took
natural foods and put

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:84%
in a few synthetic
vitamins in it,

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:90%
people were actually starving.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.312 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the reason
why there's such a weight

00:19:17.312 --> 00:19:19.580 align:middle line:84%
gain among people,
because they're

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.170 align:middle line:90%
suffering from malnutrition.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about it in the
past, how many patients I

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.960 align:middle line:84%
have had that work out
two, three hours a day

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and eat very little,
and they gain weight.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.240 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different breakdown
in our inner chemistries

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.320 align:middle line:90%
and our inner problems.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.520 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people
listening to this

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.315 align:middle line:84%
can relate, and thank you
for sharing that information.

00:19:39.315 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: You're welcome.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.015 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I didn't
realize that.

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know it was just
one masquerading in the other

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.390 align:middle line:84%
when it came to
whole food vitamins.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:84%
I want to go into
another area here,

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:84%
before we start getting
into nutrition, cancer,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:90%
and some other subjects.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: OK.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that is you
really demand that there are--

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.280 align:middle line:84%
in your practice, you fold
in the scientific proofs

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.830 align:middle line:84%
that are bearing
out what you might

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.430 align:middle line:84%
spin into motion with
someone's diagnoses

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.110 align:middle line:90%
from a mystical standpoint.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.110 align:middle line:84%
So where do these two meet, and
how does the scientific bear

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.570 align:middle line:90%
out the mystical?

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.970 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, the mystical
deals with our purpose

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.390 align:middle line:84%
for being alive and the
fact that each one of us has

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.100 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to answer a
question and also to live

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
their life in a way
that expresses something

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
that's never been
expressed before or after,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.325 align:middle line:84%
but the science tells
us the mechanism.

00:20:34.325 --> 00:20:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So explain that.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
What's that look like, when
someone comes in your door?

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, many times,
I'm their last resort,

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.760 align:middle line:84%
whether they have cancer
or any chronic disease.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
People are breaking
down because of things

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.540 align:middle line:84%
like what we call POPs
which are Persistent Organic

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Poisons or pollutants,
particularly

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.540 align:middle line:84%
the organic phosphates,
the carbamate--

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:84%
there's so many of
the solvents that we

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:84%
don't have any genetics to
clear them out of our system.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.560 align:middle line:90%
They're called cytochrome P450s.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the budget, I
do a lot of laboratory testing,

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.815 align:middle line:84%
and I use that as measurements
to see where people are at

00:21:10.815 --> 00:21:12.440 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of
therapy we need to do.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
prioritize what we're

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.130 align:middle line:90%
going to do with everybody.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.550 align:middle line:90%
People are getting disabled.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.440 align:middle line:84%
There's MIT
predictions that we'll

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.020 align:middle line:84%
have a massive epidemic
of disabled people

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.180 align:middle line:84%
that are kept alive
through pharmaceuticals

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
but won't be able to
afford to actually live

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:33.770 align:middle line:84%
a day-to-day life, and they're
talking about that in a decade

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:34.640 align:middle line:90%
from now.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So we have to, have to find
ways to give people the tools

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
to take charge of
their life, so they

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.110 align:middle line:90%
don't lose this opportunity.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.368 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're suffering,
and you're unhealthy,

00:21:44.368 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:90%
it affects your thinking.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.060 align:middle line:90%
It affects your relationships.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:90%
It affects the choices you make.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.100 align:middle line:84%
It affects your perspective
of why you're alive,

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and you become a person
of suffering and disease,

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
instead of being a person
who's somebody really

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.920 align:middle line:90%
extraordinarily special.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's something very
critical for all of us

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.715 align:middle line:90%
to express in their lives.

00:22:08.715 --> 00:22:11.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Very true, and it
seems that when someone goes

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.820 align:middle line:84%
into that backup position
of pain and suffering,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:84%
the very last thing, if you
can still manage to originate

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.880 align:middle line:84%
a clear thought or two, is
any kind of spiritual practice

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.950 align:middle line:84%
or meditation, because
the focus isn't there.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:22.910 align:middle line:90%
The energy isn't there.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like that can wait
while you repair the body,

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:90%
but in reality, that can't wait.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:90%
That is the connection.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
So am I hearing you
correctly in saying

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
that every person is born not
with an answer but a question?

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Every person comes
in here because they had

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:39.920 align:middle line:90%
a question.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Their life becomes the
answer to that question.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.042 align:middle line:84%
And if they're living a life
of suffering and torment,

00:22:46.042 --> 00:22:47.750 align:middle line:84%
if you remember what
the Dalai Lama said,

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:84%
were drawn to what's
familiar because it's

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:90%
the most suffering and torment.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard him say that,
it made a lot of sense to me.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Our habits, some
people call it karma.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:84%
They call it cause and
effect, but basically, we

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.767 align:middle line:84%
get habituated to thinking
that, if we do something

00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:07.100 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, the same
thing, the next time we'll

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:07.930 align:middle line:90%
do it better.

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And I found in my
life that that doesn't work.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:84%
When something doesn't
work, it just doesn't work.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.715 align:middle line:90%
Let's look.

00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:16.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's examine.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I know, in my own life, I've
had a change my questions,

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and that's usually given me the
direction I needed, especially

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.873 align:middle line:90%
with patients.

00:23:24.873 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you've
talked about this.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.247 align:middle line:84%
We talked about in
our last interview

00:23:28.247 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
that when you're talking
about this question

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.570 align:middle line:84%
you're coming in with,
this thing that you're

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:35.240 align:middle line:84%
trying to solve or
find an answer to,

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
or perfect within your own
being, that that's often

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:84%
passed on through
generation after generation.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And I know this gets into
the area of epigenetics.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: It is.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.015 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And these same
questions may be the same

00:23:45.015 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:84%
question that our parents
and grandparents and great

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
grandparents had that have
not really been balanced,

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.160 align:middle line:90%
addressed, actualized.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.960 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Right.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right?

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Exactly.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.720 align:middle line:84%
What happens with epigenetics
is that the situation

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of your grandparents--
so if you're a male,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
it's your grandfather
at puberty,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and that causes a
lack of methylation.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.510 align:middle line:84%
Methylation means it's a
carbon and three hydrogen that

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.020 align:middle line:84%
attach to a gene,
and if you have that,

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:90%
the gene never gets expressed.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So all of us come in
with mis-transcriptions.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:84%
So epigenetically, on the
histones, it's like a coil.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.283 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: That goes around that.

00:24:26.283 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:10%
There's an attachment,
and what happens

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.620 align:middle line:10%
is that there's information
that's transferred

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.560 align:middle line:10%
from the previous generation.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:10%
And so if your
grandparent was starving,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:43.160 align:middle line:10%
you'll have a tendency to keep--

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.480 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.250 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
this, and I wonder.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take
a little short break,

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and I want to come
back and talk about one

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
of your clients that was going
through exactly what you're

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: We've had
many since then.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Many since then.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.252 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:54.252 --> 00:24:55.460 align:middle line:90%
You'll find this fascinating.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.895 align:middle line:90%
We'll be back in just a moment.

00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:10%
We're back, and
we're going to be

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.660 align:middle line:10%
talking about this
multigenerational influence.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:10%
We now call it epigenetics.

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.785 align:middle line:10%
I think Bruce
Lipton, who you know,

00:25:05.785 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:10%
has also a very
instrumental in getting

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:10%
a lot of that
information forward.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.972 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about,
there's one case

00:25:11.972 --> 00:25:13.055 align:middle line:90%
I just happen to remember.

00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:13.855 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: OK.

00:25:13.855 --> 00:25:16.125 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: About a Mexican
girl who, as you say--

00:25:16.125 --> 00:25:17.750 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Actually,
she was Guatemalan.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A Guatemalan girl
who was really not eating a lot

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:24.555 align:middle line:84%
of food and, she had no reason
to suffer from overweight.

00:25:24.555 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So let's start from
there, and then you

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.010 align:middle line:84%
can broaden it out into
some other clients,

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.780 align:middle line:90%
and what you're finding.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: When I met her, I
assumed she was eating a junk

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.150 align:middle line:10%
food diet, because
that's typical with kids.

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:41.140 align:middle line:10%
And I was surprised
and shocked when

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:47.350 align:middle line:10%
she came in with her mother,
and she was eating organic.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.430 align:middle line:84%
She was an A student, and she
was on the girls' soccer team

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:53.750 align:middle line:90%
and was a good soccer player.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:58.810 align:middle line:84%
She was exercising a
really healthy lifestyle,

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and no matter what she did,
she was gaining weight.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And she
wasn't closet eating.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.400 align:middle line:84%
You were pretty
sure of that, or.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't have been there?

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.050 align:middle line:90%
Right

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: She wasn't
closet eating,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.805 align:middle line:84%
according to her mother
and according to her.

00:26:07.805 --> 00:26:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK Yeah.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: It wasn't about
how much she was eating.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So it was a mystery.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:12.772 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, I've
had other cases.

00:26:12.772 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I had one woman that was 360
pounds that was eating a salad

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.800 align:middle line:90%
and exercising two hours a day.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we know the
mechanism of why that happens.

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:10%
It's not about the food
and how much you're eating.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.560 align:middle line:10%
It's about estrogen
dominance and toxins

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:10%
that your body can't release
being stored in the fat cells.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.800 align:middle line:10%
And the fat cells can
inflame up to 100 times

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.550 align:middle line:10%
their normal weight,
and you gain weight

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:36.730 align:middle line:10%
with the inflammation.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.990 align:middle line:10%
But this girl, she was
storing everything.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.540 align:middle line:10%
She wasn't utilizing.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:10%
And when I questioned
her mother,

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:10%
she said the girl's grandmother
had 12 children, and most

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.160 align:middle line:10%
of the time, there was
not enough food, so

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.752 align:middle line:10%
her great grandmother
with her grandmother.

00:27:01.752 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're
four generations out.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Exactly.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.295 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is
this fear of not enough.

00:27:06.295 --> 00:27:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: It wasn't a fear.

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a program.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: A program.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:09.550 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: It's a
biochemical pathway.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.300 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But doesn't
it start as a fear?

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.100 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: No.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Can I say that
it will seed as a fear?

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: No, because
there's no fear there.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:90%
That's what's so confusing.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: It's
not psychological.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.605 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: There's actually
a mechanism that affects

00:27:21.605 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:10%
the inside of the mitochondria.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:30.220 align:middle line:10%
It's called the nitric
oxide-peroxynitrite pathway,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.520 align:middle line:10%
and it's the same pathway we
use in the emotional centers

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.760 align:middle line:10%
to learn things that gets
hijacked for various reasons.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.955 align:middle line:10%
And so these tendencies
of fearing that I'm not

00:27:40.955 --> 00:27:41.830 align:middle line:10%
going to have enough.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.515 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to starve to death.

00:27:43.515 --> 00:27:44.890 align:middle line:10%
I'm not getting
enough nutrients.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:45.190 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: It's not about
eating the wrong nutrients.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.100 align:middle line:10%
It's not getting enough.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.620 align:middle line:10%
Even though, when
you get enough,

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.960 align:middle line:10%
you're still programmed--
unless you break that program--

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:10%
to store it.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.878 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So this is
happening multigenerational

00:27:56.878 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:84%
you're finding with
a lot of clients?

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:58.860 align:middle line:90%
You're finding the same story.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>>COHEN: It would
skip a generation.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it goes
back to the grandparents.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: It goes back to the
grandparents and sometimes

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:90%
the great-grandparents.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.587 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The
great-grandparents,

00:28:06.587 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:10%
that's interesting, because
just on a personal note,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.780 align:middle line:10%
in my bloodline, the
whole maternal side,

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.110 align:middle line:10%
everyone is very overweight.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Some have been even obese and
morbidly obese in a few cases,

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.270 align:middle line:90%
and it goes on and on.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And actually, at five, I
decided I couldn't do that,

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and I decided to not do that.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.670 align:middle line:84%
As a five year old, how
do you know what this is?

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:84%
So what happened in a case
like that, where then I

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.815 align:middle line:84%
became the first generation
to not carry that forward?

00:28:35.815 --> 00:28:37.690 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Well, what
does that tell you about

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.058 align:middle line:10%
your personality?

00:28:39.058 --> 00:28:40.225 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: I was determined.

00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:41.475 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: You were determined.

00:28:41.475 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:90%
What else?

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was able to
manifest my thoughts in the way

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:47.630 align:middle line:90%
I wanted.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.630 align:middle line:90%
What does it say, determination?

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.930 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: It means that you
were an independent thinker

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:10%
at a very early age.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.370 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:54.920 align:middle line:10%
There you go.

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And you noticed
that something wasn't working

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.270 align:middle line:10%
in the family.

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:02.560 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So you're saying
then this is the beginning

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.005 align:middle line:10%
of the shift for everyone to
recognize it and make a choice?

00:29:06.005 --> 00:29:08.130 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: This is the value
of starting a case with

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.320 align:middle line:10%
homeopathy, but I'm a
classical homeopath.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm trained in that.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.650 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: But then I
go into the nutrition.

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:16.350 align:middle line:10%
I go into the laboratory tests.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.560 align:middle line:10%
There's other steps after.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.110 align:middle line:10%
I teach people meditation,
and there's many, many steps

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:10%
in changing the lifestyle.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.350 align:middle line:10%
But the great power
of the homeopathy

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.660 align:middle line:10%
is it quiets down,
just like Montagnier

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.640 align:middle line:10%
found the work in Shanghai,
that it quiets down

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.840 align:middle line:10%
these tendencies.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.800 align:middle line:10%
This is all just reactions.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it's quieting
down that hidden program

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.900 align:middle line:90%
in your personal matrix?

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Yeah, simple signals
of kinases that signal the body

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:10%
to do certain things, and
then we release other signals,

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:10%
like cytokines.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:52.168 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:29:52.168 --> 00:29:54.940 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And so by
quieting that reactivity,

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.410 align:middle line:10%
saying you don't
have to do that,

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.570 align:middle line:10%
you give the
different information.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:10%
Then, you can start
making the changes,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:10%
and they'll start work.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.710 align:middle line:10%
Many people today are
suffering from these chemicals.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:10%
My most influential person in my
whole life was my Uncle Robert.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:10%
He was a mailman.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.320 align:middle line:10%
He was the last of the
roaring individuals.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.850 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: I loved the man,
and he taught me about life.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:10%
But when he was born, there was
only one chemical in his body,

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.960 align:middle line:10%
and that was lead from
the Industrial Revolution.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.160 align:middle line:10%
Today, the average baby,
through the latest statistics,

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.480 align:middle line:10%
is born with 91 foreign
chemicals in their body.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.284 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: An average human
being today has close to 260,

00:30:37.284 --> 00:30:41.410 align:middle line:10%
265 chemicals, no studies
how they interact.

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.820 align:middle line:10%
And some people that can't
clear them, or some people that

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.015 align:middle line:10%
are estrogen-dominant,
which doesn't

00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:49.390 align:middle line:10%
mean they have
too much estrogen.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:53.800 align:middle line:10%
It means they're under stress,
so their progesterone is

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.202 align:middle line:10%
converted into cortisol
to handle the stress.

00:30:57.202 --> 00:30:58.660 align:middle line:10%
And then they have
estrogen telling

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.080 align:middle line:10%
the body build and swell and
do all the things sitting out

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:10%
there, and eventually,
you run out

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.050 align:middle line:10%
of storage places
for the toxins.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:09.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
then what happens?

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.657 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Then, you
get a breakdown Then,

00:31:11.657 --> 00:31:13.990 align:middle line:84%
it's just a matter of time
that you get chronic disease.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.430 align:middle line:90%
You get your cancers.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.310 align:middle line:10%
Depending on your own
genetics and epigenetics,

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:10%
you'll come down with all
these chronic diseases

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.530 align:middle line:10%
we're seeing from
diabetes, to a lot

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.375 align:middle line:10%
of mental conditions, asthma.

00:31:26.375 --> 00:31:28.750 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
how you start clearing it,

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.650 align:middle line:10%
because I think, do you deal
not just with homeopathy?

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion of green
things, Chlorella and such?

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are doing a
lot of greens-- green juices,

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.350 align:middle line:84%
green powders,
algaes, and so forth.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:90%
What is your feeling on this?

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.550 align:middle line:84%
How do you recommend
people maybe start

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.462 align:middle line:84%
the process of clearing these,
and is green a way to go?

00:31:51.462 --> 00:31:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, you
have to first level--

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.977 align:middle line:90%
level of toxicity.

00:31:54.977 --> 00:31:56.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
technology out there.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.770 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of tests that
we do from MetaMetrics,

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.420 align:middle line:10%
and there's Cyrix.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:10%
Gluten is a big one for
one out of five people.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:04.690 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yep.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.930 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Not everybody.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:07.693 align:middle line:10%
It's not good to be
gluten-free, if you

00:32:07.693 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:10%
don't have a gluten problem.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What do you mean
it's not good to be gluten-free?

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Well, gluten is
very rich in phytonutrients.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.520 align:middle line:10%
So if you're depriving
yourself of--

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.350 align:middle line:10%
gluten is not a health issue.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.260 align:middle line:10%
It's a genetic issue.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.060 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.393 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: So it's a poison,
if your body can't clear it.

00:32:21.393 --> 00:32:23.740 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right, but if
your body can clear it,

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.750 align:middle line:10%
you're saying it actually
is a vital nutrient.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: It's a vital nutrient.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.690 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And now, you're the
first person I've heard really

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:90%
talk about this part.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.417 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And a lot of
people get misdiagnosed

00:32:31.417 --> 00:32:34.630 align:middle line:10%
as gluten-sensitive, because
they're really just allergic

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:35.770 align:middle line:10%
to proteins.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:37.990 align:middle line:10%
Their body's not
handling proteins,

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.750 align:middle line:10%
and so gluten is one of them.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:10%
So that's a whole
different problem.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.330 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.705 align:middle line:10%
What is the name
of that problem?

00:32:44.705 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:10%
It starts at a P. My
mind is blanking on it,

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:10%
when you're allergic
to the proteins.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:53.240 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Well, to me, it's
just that you see generally

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.280 align:middle line:10%
their body starts producing
antibodies to everything from

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.740 align:middle line:10%
soy, to milk, to wheat, to
eggs, and vegetable proteins.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.703 align:middle line:10%
I've even seen that.

00:33:03.703 --> 00:33:04.870 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So how does that--

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: That's why I
don't do allergy tests,

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.888 align:middle line:10%
only at the end of a
case, if I'm stuck.

00:33:08.888 --> 00:33:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how does
that get spun into motion,

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.150 align:middle line:84%
where you end up allergic
to that entire array?

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Break down the
immune system, you're gut.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.280 align:middle line:90%
You're gut's off.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.950 align:middle line:84%
You're tight junctions
are wide open,

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and everything is
flowing into the blood,

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:90%
and the liver can break it down.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So
leaky gut syndrome.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:22.888 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Leaky
gut is one of them,

00:33:22.888 --> 00:33:24.100 align:middle line:10%
but even there's many others.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.360 align:middle line:90%
You have to repair the gut.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.490 align:middle line:90%
So let's start at the base.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:27.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Literally.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: OK.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So if we
have toxicity issues,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.080 align:middle line:84%
say you even go to the extent
of having your blood work done,

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.330 align:middle line:84%
finding out what kind of
toxins you have in the body.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.580 align:middle line:84%
You know you're allergic to
these other things we just

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.100 align:middle line:84%
mentioned, because your
body's not handling them well.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.450 align:middle line:84%
You're getting tired, you're
bloating up, and all this.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.183 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin
to repair the guts?

00:33:46.183 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, if
somebody has a gut problem,

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and I think most conditions
start with the gut.

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:50.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.420 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: I'll do
an expanded GI test,

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:10%
and based on what that'll
tell me, or if it's--

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:10%
like I just had a referral
from overseas of two

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.230 align:middle line:10%
young girls, six and
eight, that are presently

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.650 align:middle line:10%
going into puberty.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:07.450 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Oh.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And so with them, so
the only medical treatment is

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.750 align:middle line:10%
to suppress the
hormone development,

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.840 align:middle line:10%
and you have to do something.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.308 align:middle line:10%
But I told them, I think
it's most likely heavy metals

00:34:20.308 --> 00:34:21.850 align:middle line:10%
that your daughters
are not clearing,

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:26.530 align:middle line:10%
because especially cadmium
will mimic zinc and hijack

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:10%
those pathways and you'll
become estrogen-dominant.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.939 align:middle line:10%
Estrogen tells the body to grow.

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:35.739 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:38.409 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Progesterone tells
the body what to grow into.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:10%
But if your progesterone
is converting immediately

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.530 align:middle line:10%
to cortisol, which is how
it works biochemically,

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.300 align:middle line:10%
you have estrogen
sitting out there,

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:54.710 align:middle line:10%
and that's a very profound
problem for so many people.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.910 align:middle line:10%
So the gut test you do
is not a blood test.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.360 align:middle line:10%
I mean, blood only tells
you what's in the blood.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.700 align:middle line:10%
That's like saying, if you
want to know what vegetables

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.250 align:middle line:10%
are available in
Whole Foods is you

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:09.060 align:middle line:10%
hijack some trucks
on the freeway

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.505 align:middle line:10%
and see what's in the trunks.

00:35:10.505 --> 00:35:11.380 align:middle line:90%
They won't tell you--

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are you talking more
stool samples or something?

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:13.570 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: No.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.220 align:middle line:84%
We do both saliva
and stool samples.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:15.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.830 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: The reason why we
do saliva is because a lot

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.830 align:middle line:10%
of the parasites hide.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:19.630 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.920 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And so the least
you can check for antibodies.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.962 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah, and a
lot of people I interview,

00:35:23.962 --> 00:35:26.260 align:middle line:10%
this is really agreed
upon as the way to go now,

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.222 align:middle line:10%
instead of blood.

00:35:27.222 --> 00:35:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, both
of them are valuable

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:30.900 align:middle line:84%
but they're for
different reasons.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.700 align:middle line:90%
I do both.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.150 align:middle line:90%
I do a lot.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.430 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So once you've
done the tests and so forth,

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.618 align:middle line:10%
now you see what you see.

00:35:35.618 --> 00:35:37.160 align:middle line:84%
They're allergic to
all these things,

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.680 align:middle line:84%
according to their blood, I
mean according to their saliva

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:90%
and their Stools.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.230 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin the
clearing process?

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: The clearing process
first is to identify what

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:46.740 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't be in your body.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.540 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.310 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And reduce
that exposure.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And the second
thing is pretty simple.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
It's how to get it
out the quickest way.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And many people are
too sick to get it out all

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.700 align:middle line:90%
at once.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:57.500 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.260 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: So I sometimes use
a very controlled medical

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:10%
cleanse, and I make adaptions,
depending if there is heavy

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:10.430 align:middle line:10%
metals or there is these
toxins and solvents and stuff.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:10%
They have to leach amount
of the body in a way

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.170 align:middle line:10%
that a person doesn't
get so sick that actually

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.420 align:middle line:10%
their life can be in jeopardy.

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: That's a mistake a
lot of new practitioners make.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.550 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Thinking
you need something,

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.830 align:middle line:10%
and it's good for somebody,
and they're very sick,

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:25.980 align:middle line:10%
so let's give it to them.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:26.780 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And you can only
do one thing at a time.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.060 align:middle line:10%
So it really depends
what we find.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.950 align:middle line:10%
And right now,
I'm finding things

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.190 align:middle line:10%
that I never found before.

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.990 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Like?

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.660 align:middle line:10%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.202 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: I had a
woman from Ukraine,

00:36:38.202 --> 00:36:42.080 align:middle line:10%
and we found they wanted
to cut out her gallbladder

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.220 align:middle line:10%
in the Ukraine.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And her whole family is here,
actually, in the United States,

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.700 align:middle line:10%
and I've treated
everybody in the family.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Once I helped one,
they all came in.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So they flew grandma in, and I
told them don't do the surgery.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:10%
And I found
Blastocystis hominis.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.410 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You found what?

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:01.400 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Blastocystis hominis.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.740 align:middle line:10%
What is that?

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.920 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: That's a
really bad parasite.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.253 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This is not something
that you'd seen before?

00:37:08.253 --> 00:37:09.053 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: No.

00:37:09.053 --> 00:37:11.700 align:middle line:10%
When I started doing this 30
years ago, we never saw that.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.740 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: So what's happening?

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Is it something that's adapted?

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.052 align:middle line:90%
Where's this coming from?

00:37:15.052 --> 00:37:16.380 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: We're not adapting.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.110 align:middle line:90%
We're not adapting.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: We're not adapting.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.208 align:middle line:84%
Our barrier systems
are broken down.

00:37:21.208 --> 00:37:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But are parasites
adapting, or is it--

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Yes.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They're adapting.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: They're adapting also.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.950 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of times, when
we find these things,

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.240 align:middle line:10%
it's because the barrier system.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.460 align:middle line:10%
That's why people are taking
these proton inhibitors that

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:10%
shouldn't be taking that.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:10%
Thinking that they're suffering
from acid reflux, when they're

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.990 align:middle line:10%
really suffering from they
can't digest the food,

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:47.460 align:middle line:10%
and the food is fermenting
and putrefying in their gut.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.180 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And so it feels
like you have too much acid,

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.795 align:middle line:84%
but when you're under stress,
your body stops making acid.

00:37:52.795 --> 00:37:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that's right
in guidance physiology.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.888 align:middle line:10%
That should be well known.

00:37:56.888 --> 00:37:59.180 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So what happens
when you start throwing acid

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.640 align:middle line:10%
reducers down there?

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.810 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: They can't
handle proteins.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.070 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Interesting.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: So proteins that
you need to rebuild your body,

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.380 align:middle line:84%
because your body has
to have a balance.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Every day you get a catabolic,
and every day get anabolic.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.445 align:middle line:10%
The good news, you get to
rebuild yourself every day.

00:38:17.445 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: If you don't throw
some monkey wrench in there

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.762 align:middle line:10%
to stop the process.

00:38:21.762 --> 00:38:23.720 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Or if you go
too much into catabolic.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.140 align:middle line:10%
You get into chronic stress,
your body needs energy.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:29.210 align:middle line:10%
That's the problem with
a lot of the cancers,

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.960 align:middle line:10%
and when it happens with
cancers, you get hypoxic.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.670 align:middle line:10%
In the energy parts of the
cell, you get oxygen-deprived,

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.840 align:middle line:10%
because the body is
fighting for its life,

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:45.600 align:middle line:10%
and so it converts into the part
of the body to produce energy.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:10%
So your body tears
yourself down,

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.470 align:middle line:10%
and you don't have enough
to repair yourself.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.432 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Is that a fundamental
truth of all cancers?

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, I don't
know about all cancers.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:57.850 align:middle line:84%
I work with a
cancer researchers.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.990 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: So his opinions.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:02.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not as extreme
as his opinion.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.640 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: But he found in his
research at Stanford that many

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:11.420 align:middle line:10%
of the cancer therapies,
particularly chemotherapy,

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.780 align:middle line:10%
actually drives precancerous
cells into cancer.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.770 align:middle line:10%
My opinion, there are cancers--

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:19.430 align:middle line:10%
and it's not a talk on cancer--

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.040 align:middle line:10%
that chemotherapy saves lives.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.630 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: With
certain specific ones.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:27.950 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Specific cancers,
it shortens life in different

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:10%
cancers.

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:31.820 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Do you feel
comfortable mentioning

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:33.963 align:middle line:10%
the cancers that can
successfully be addressed with

00:39:33.963 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:10%
chemo versus the rest?

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.180 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Well, we know them.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.130 align:middle line:10%
Everybody knows them.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:41.040 align:middle line:10%
They're all available--
leukemias, lymphomas, response.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.460 align:middle line:10%
Some of the ones that have a
pernicious anemia component

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.910 align:middle line:10%
have been found to
work with chemo,

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.980 align:middle line:10%
but many of the cancers
that people are having--

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.643 align:middle line:10%
the kidney cancers and stuff--

00:39:50.643 --> 00:39:51.560 align:middle line:10%
it's not saving lives.

00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.650 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of
it is a breakdown

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.650 align:middle line:10%
in these individual
pathways, and some of it's

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:58.970 align:middle line:10%
to do with genetics.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:00.410 align:middle line:10%
Now they are making
breakthroughs.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:02.570 align:middle line:10%
There's really good
stuff going on,

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.120 align:middle line:10%
but it's not keeping
up with the breakdown

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.780 align:middle line:10%
over our immune systems
from the toxic overload.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk
about, since it's not a talk

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.890 align:middle line:84%
on cancer, it's a talk on
restoring immune system

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:15.690 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Right.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Restoring
authenticity and integrity

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.200 align:middle line:84%
within the entire being, as we
started talking about to begin

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.260 align:middle line:90%
with.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a being that comes
in with this question

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.140 align:middle line:84%
that they're
uniquely positioned.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Right.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: To find the answer
to and express in this world.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:34.450 align:middle line:84%
Somehow that gets hijacked
along the way, in most cases.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:38.010 align:middle line:84%
We end up in positions
where we start also taking

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.720 align:middle line:90%
on these familial patterns.

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.520 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Right.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we've got
the familiar programming

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:43.610 align:middle line:90%
that's going on.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
We've got a load of toxins that
we're swimming in a sea of.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.710 align:middle line:84%
So with that, how do we
begin recovering ourselves

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.760 align:middle line:90%
in general?

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.240 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: In my opinion,
the first thing I've done--

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.760 align:middle line:84%
first of all, the immune system,
most people get it wrong.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.282 align:middle line:84%
They think that they're
having immune problems.

00:41:00.282 --> 00:41:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Their immune system
is not working.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.210 align:middle line:84%
It's suppressed,
when it's really

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.010 align:middle line:90%
an overactive immune system.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.457 align:middle line:90%
It's overreacting.

00:41:06.457 --> 00:41:08.040 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that
true in most cases?

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.950 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: In most cases,
it's the people that are real

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.990 align:middle line:84%
seriously sick that the
immune system doesn't react.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.415 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: And then what happens
is that the two things that set

00:41:17.415 --> 00:41:19.860 align:middle line:10%
off these chronic diseases
is always inflammation

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.700 align:middle line:10%
and irritation.

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.650 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.470 align:middle line:84%
So you have to reduce
the inflammation, which

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:28.170 align:middle line:84%
what are some of the most
fundamental ways in which we

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.090 align:middle line:90%
go about that, all humans?

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I know we're all wired
very differently.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you
can prescribe anything

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.025 align:middle line:90%
for any particular ailment.

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, it's not
only what you ingest.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.600 align:middle line:84%
It's taking away from
your diet, which was

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.850 align:middle line:90%
a question we didn't get to.

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:90%
You didn't ask me the question.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.258 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get to about greens.

00:41:43.258 --> 00:41:43.630 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
the green stuff.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Your diet,
everybody's diet,

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.903 align:middle line:90%
should be 80% micronutrients.

00:41:49.903 --> 00:41:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, really?

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:52.080 align:middle line:90%
That's a lot of green.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.440 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Not just greens,
all the micronutrients are

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.080 align:middle line:84%
the greens, particularly
the cruciferous,

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.580 align:middle line:90%
because they're high in indols.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you're lacking
certain genetic ability

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.400 align:middle line:84%
to produce certain
enzymes for clearing

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.710 align:middle line:84%
the cruciferous vegetables,
particularly the Brussels

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:10.230 align:middle line:84%
sprouts and kale,
are particularly

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:13.065 align:middle line:84%
powerful for overcoming
the genetic problems.

00:42:13.065 --> 00:42:14.190 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.075 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And then the next
one is for the methylation we

00:42:17.075 --> 00:42:20.440 align:middle line:84%
talked about, with the
epigenetics is onions

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and garlic.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What about some
people who can't do onions

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:23.620 align:middle line:90%
and garlic?

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just their
bodies don't like it.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.220 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, why
don't they like it?

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I don't know.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.620 align:middle line:90%
You tell me.

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:29.010 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Toxicity.

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.060 align:middle line:90%
Chemicals.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: It's leaching
out the chemicals,

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:34.220 align:middle line:84%
because when they leach out
the chemicals, that get sick.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:36.420 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:36.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Yeah.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:90%
They're already sick.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.770 align:middle line:90%
That's why it's hard.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.470 align:middle line:84%
It's embedded into your tissues,
particularly your fat cells.

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And then when your body
starts getting energy,

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:48.830 align:middle line:84%
it will leak come out, and
you'll get really sick.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And they call it a
healing crisis, which

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.030 align:middle line:90%
to me is there's no such thing.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.760 align:middle line:84%
You see a lot of
practitioners saying--

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.400 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not criticizing them--

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.250 align:middle line:84%
but I was taught the same
thing, that oh, they're just

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.740 align:middle line:90%
going through a healing crisis.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.540 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:02.770 align:middle line:90%
They're going through a crisis.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: There's
no healing crisis.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.510 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:06.630 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: So it's
not controlled.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I don't want
to get you off this path,

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.290 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of people are
writing right now, and so am I,

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:11.060 align:middle line:90%
taking notes.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:11.280 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: OK.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we've got
Brussels sprouts and kale.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Mushrooms.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:14.477 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Onions and
garlic, mushrooms,

00:43:14.477 --> 00:43:16.310 align:middle line:84%
any kind of mushrooms
or wild mushrooms?

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.268 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, I'm happy
people just eat them,

00:43:18.268 --> 00:43:22.273 align:middle line:84%
but the great ones would
be shiitake, maitake.

00:43:22.273 --> 00:43:23.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: The meatier ones.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Yeah.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.310 align:middle line:84%
If a woman eats one
mushroom a day--

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and I guess this is true for
men for prostate cancer--

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:32.550 align:middle line:84%
the rate of cancer
goes down 56%,

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and if they eat five
a day, breast cancer

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:36.870 align:middle line:90%
goes down over 80%.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:38.275 align:middle line:84%
So why aren't
people eating them?

00:43:38.275 --> 00:43:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And if they're
not eating them, I

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.030 align:middle line:84%
give it to them in
whole food supplements.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.656 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do they need to be
raw and intact or can you cook

00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:45.456 align:middle line:90%
them?

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.610 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: You can steam them.

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:47.210 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:48.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:90%
So now after mushrooms--

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.167 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: All cooking
is is pre-digestion,

00:43:52.167 --> 00:43:54.000 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of things
people can't break down.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.810 align:middle line:84%
They're not producing
the enzymes.

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:56.750 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Such as
cellulose and all.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:57.550 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.960 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: So then
there's the mushrooms,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:84%
and then the next thing you
want the beans and berries.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of this is modified
based on their blood type.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.977 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:10.977 --> 00:44:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And then the
last one is seeds and nuts.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.010 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And a lot of people
on a vegan diet are not getting

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:22.133 align:middle line:84%
enough proteins, and
I'm for a vegan diet,

00:44:22.133 --> 00:44:23.550 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not against
the vegan diet.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.425 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was a
vegetarian for many years,

00:44:25.425 --> 00:44:28.740 align:middle line:84%
and I did go into pretty much
a crisis from lack of protein.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.740 align:middle line:90%
I started breaking down.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.540 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Right.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: After
all those years.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: If you want
to be vegetarian,

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:90%
depending on your blood type.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a lot
of patients from India

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.700 align:middle line:84%
who are vegetarian because
of religious reasons.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.820 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: And they're O's.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.780 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is a
mediating blood type.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:44.660 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Well, it's
protein-dependent.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Protein.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Because their
body's designed to store.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.058 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: That's
why they get sick.

00:44:49.058 --> 00:44:50.183 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:44:50.183 --> 00:44:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Yeah, because
it's the oldest gene.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: A's, it's
a different problem.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:55.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: So that's a
stress-related gene.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:57.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.180 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you've
been taking notes,

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.147 align:middle line:84%
because we have all kinds
of things we can start

00:45:03.147 --> 00:45:04.230 align:middle line:90%
focusing a little more on.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: So let's
say 80% of your diet.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.380 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.970 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: The rest is your
proteins and your carbs,

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and of course,
from a historical,

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.630 align:middle line:84%
evolutionary standpoint, you
don't want to limit your simple

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:16.650 align:middle line:90%
carbs.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.420 align:middle line:10%
All that does is light the fire.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.970 align:middle line:90%
That's like the kindling.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:24.060 align:middle line:84%
The complex carbs-- the
latest stuff that we've gotten

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.790 align:middle line:84%
is we need 25,000
to 45,000 nutrients.

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:30.540 align:middle line:84%
We used to think, just
eat a healthy diet.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.750 align:middle line:10%
A year and a half
ago, scientists

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:37.110 align:middle line:10%
have found that we
need a wide variety.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And each nutrient
in our intestines,

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.910 align:middle line:90%
it's like think of a shaggy rug.

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Each villi-- which
is like a hair

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.320 align:middle line:84%
protuberance-- it's specific
for a specific nutrient.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.610 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't have
enough nutrients, a variety

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.447 align:middle line:10%
of nutrients attached
to it, your body

00:45:52.447 --> 00:45:54.780 align:middle line:10%
starts getting confused, and
you get autoimmune disease.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.757 align:middle line:90%
It starts attacking itself.

00:45:57.757 --> 00:45:59.340 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's so
incredibly complex,

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.200 align:middle line:84%
when it seems like
it should be so easy.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.060 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: It is easy.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:07.080 align:middle line:84%
It is eat what we're designed
to and what we evolve--

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:08.750 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And the simplicity of
it all is to live a life that

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:15.543 align:middle line:84%
has six components
every single day.

00:46:15.543 --> 00:46:16.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's
talk about those.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: OK.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.380 align:middle line:84%
The six components
is complexity.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have
every day for your brain

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.860 align:middle line:84%
and your nervous system
to keep developing.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You have to
keep your mind engaged.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: But it
has to be complex.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.590 align:middle line:90%
It can't be just repetitive.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.098 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: It has to
have many components.

00:46:32.098 --> 00:46:34.720 align:middle line:84%
You have to think about it and
figure it out and work with it.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So a
challenge for the mind.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: You've
got the second one.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.280 align:middle line:84%
You have to be challenged
to go a little beyond what

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.620 align:middle line:90%
you think you can.

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.410 align:middle line:90%
The next one is nurturing.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:51.960 align:middle line:84%
We're designed to be touched and
communal, and that's oxytocin.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.270 align:middle line:90%
That's not a sexual touch.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.390 align:middle line:84%
That's a loving touch that
has no sexual component.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.570 align:middle line:84%
That releases
oxytocin which enables

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.200 align:middle line:84%
us to feel a part of
things and with things.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.170 align:middle line:90%
The next is movement.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.750 align:middle line:10%
You have to move your
body every single day,

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:16.080 align:middle line:10%
and the next thing is
the right nutrition,

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.130 align:middle line:10%
and that's individual.

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody has
the same nutrition.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.620 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.210 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And the
right nutrition,

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and the third thing is a
purpose beyond yourself

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:90%
that's communal.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:30.900 align:middle line:10%
So eating a meal
that's calorie-dense,

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:37.080 align:middle line:10%
full of nutrients with a lot
of laughter and a lot of fun

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.700 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of feeling
a part of each other,

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:10%
that's going to add so
many years to your life

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.770 align:middle line:10%
and the quality of your life.

00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And then the ability to
care about each other

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:50.370 align:middle line:84%
is so important, and that
the purpose goes beyond.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:53.017 align:middle line:84%
And what happens,
it doesn't matter

00:47:53.017 --> 00:47:55.350 align:middle line:84%
what's going on outside you,
because it's all inside you

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.910 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:59.460 align:middle line:90%
You are your creator.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:05.342 align:middle line:84%
It's inside you, that
ability to create and heal.

00:48:05.342 --> 00:48:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Your nervous system
will continue--

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.000 align:middle line:84%
it's called
neosynaptic genesis--

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.463 align:middle line:84%
you'll keep producing synapses,
no matter how old you are.

00:48:13.463 --> 00:48:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see
people though, they

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.610 align:middle line:84%
won't have these chronic
diseases as they age.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:21.570 align:middle line:84%
They'll be very rare, if you
have those six components.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And then you have to
have a life of purpose.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So your life has to go through
the stages of attuning yourself

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:30.620 align:middle line:90%
to truth.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.710 align:middle line:10%
Truth never changes,
and when you always

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:38.340 align:middle line:10%
tell the truth, most
importantly to yourself,

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.590 align:middle line:10%
you start trusting yourself.

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you trust
yourself, then you

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.450 align:middle line:84%
can have gratitude
and appreciation,

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and that begets love, which we
all need, love and compassion.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we'd live a life that
is full of integrity, honor,

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:55.010 align:middle line:90%
respect.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: Which is
critical and integrity.

00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:02.818 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's a
beautiful formula.

00:49:02.818 --> 00:49:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> COHEN: And it's right
out of the tree of life.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:10.055 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and this is
just an observation I've made.

00:49:10.055 --> 00:49:11.430 align:middle line:84%
What you were just
talking about,

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:84%
eating these nutrient-dense
meals with other people

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:16.502 align:middle line:90%
and laughing.

00:49:16.502 --> 00:49:18.210 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
laughing and talking,

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.025 align:middle line:84%
it allows your food to
have time to even digest.

00:49:20.025 --> 00:49:20.825 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Yeah.

00:49:20.825 --> 00:49:23.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: One of the most
depressing things I see is

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:29.820 align:middle line:84%
there's been a kind of a
trend for people who are

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.960 align:middle line:84%
on their own, oftentimes, will
go to some of the larger health

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.500 align:middle line:84%
food stores that have an area,
a seating area restaurant with

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:84%
them, often go
there by themselves.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.820 align:middle line:84%
You can go into a lot of
these stores in the evening,

00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:43.480 align:middle line:84%
all these people
are dining alone.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.650 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
gloomiest places to be.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's going
there because they're

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:52.600 align:middle line:84%
trying to take in these
nutrient-rich foods,

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:55.600 align:middle line:84%
but it's just depressing
being in that environment.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Right.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.525 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Every person
sitting at their own table,

00:49:58.525 --> 00:50:01.200 align:middle line:84%
not talking to each other,
of course, not touching.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.330 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Right, and
that's a big problem,

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:09.120 align:middle line:10%
but the other problem is sharing
a meal with somebody that wants

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:10%
to share their
problems with you.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:11.390 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:12.190 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.820 align:middle line:10%
>> COHEN: Because then you
won't digest your food.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It should be fun and
light and enjoyable.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.520 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, Gerald,
on that note, OK,

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:10%
thank you for making that
demarcation between the two

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:24.870 align:middle line:10%
experiences.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate it, and I
thank you for your time

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:29.445 align:middle line:84%
and for your wisdom and
sharing it with us today.

00:50:29.445 --> 00:50:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> COHEN: Oh, I enjoyed it.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.120 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: For anyone who would
