>> Regina Meredith: The more
I research, the more I come

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:37.926 align:middle line:84%
to understand how divinely
equipped the body is

00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:41.263 align:middle line:84%
for healing itself once
we remove the impediment.

00:00:41.263 --> 00:00:43.865 align:middle line:84%
In the tradition of some of the
great physicists out of Germany

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and Austria during the 1970's
and 80's, Johan Boswinkel, too,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.172 align:middle line:84%
came to understand that the
body is uniquely equipped

00:00:51.172 --> 00:00:55.176 align:middle line:84%
to use its own cellular light to
rebalance itself energy systems.

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:57.379 align:middle line:84%
The end result is
the reversal of just

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.648 align:middle line:84%
about every known
disease, and we're going

00:00:59.648 --> 00:01:02.117 align:middle line:84%
to take just a moment or two
to look at a little video

00:01:02.117 --> 00:01:04.085 align:middle line:84%
that will set this
interview up, give you an idea

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:05.553 align:middle line:84%
of what we're going
to be talking about.

00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:14.629 align:middle line:90%
[ Music ]

00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:13.214 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was a nice little
set up, and I noticed

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:14.849 align:middle line:90%
that one little phrase in there

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:84%
that disease begins
with a lack of light.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we don't
think of our bodies

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.991 align:middle line:90%
in this way at all anymore.

00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:24.926 align:middle line:84%
We think we can throw
something at it.

00:03:24.926 --> 00:03:25.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Johan Boswinkel: Yeah -

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:26.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina Meredith: Yeah -

00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:27.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Johan Boswinkel:

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:30.231 align:middle line:84%
But [inaudible] body is the
most sensitive instrument

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:31.299 align:middle line:90%
of this planet.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.537 align:middle line:84%
And I would like to start with
a little bit of your own life

00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:37.238 align:middle line:84%
because this is quite
a journey for you.

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:40.075 align:middle line:84%
You had a lot of different
interests as a young man

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:42.610 align:middle line:84%
when you were still in the age
of going to the university,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.081 align:middle line:84%
and you studied many different
things, and every time,

00:03:46.081 --> 00:03:50.385 align:middle line:84%
you would stop because the
human factor was not taken

00:03:50.385 --> 00:03:51.619 align:middle line:90%
into account.

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.622 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea of that
part of your young journey.

00:03:54.622 --> 00:04:00.728 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, my father told me
to always question everything.

00:04:00.728 --> 00:04:03.331 align:middle line:90%
And when I studied the economy,

00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:07.402 align:middle line:84%
I was wondering why
economic plans never work,

00:04:07.402 --> 00:04:10.638 align:middle line:84%
and I came to the conclusion
that economic plans,

00:04:10.638 --> 00:04:12.941 align:middle line:84%
they cannot work,
economy cannot work

00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.576 align:middle line:84%
if they don't include
human factor.

00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:21.216 align:middle line:84%
And in order to find
out more about humans,

00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:26.287 align:middle line:84%
I studied medicine,
and I was very naive.

00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:33.027 align:middle line:84%
And I found that medicine, you
learn everything about diseases,

00:04:33.027 --> 00:04:35.763 align:middle line:90%
bacteria, viruses, drugs,

00:04:35.763 --> 00:04:38.700 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't learn
anything about humans.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.267 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I know.

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:40.101 align:middle line:90%
Is that amazing?

00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:41.402 align:middle line:90%
Psychology, same thing.

00:04:41.402 --> 00:04:43.938 align:middle line:84%
[multiple speakers] Everything
about pathology, drugs,

00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:46.841 align:middle line:84%
you know, and diagnosis, but
nothing about the human -

00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:47.976 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:50.145 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, there was a
point in this journey

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:53.481 align:middle line:84%
where something turned a
light on for you, literally,

00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:55.850 align:middle line:84%
that became the quest
that has resulted

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.953 align:middle line:84%
in this amazing technology
that'll last you a lifetime,

00:04:58.953 --> 00:05:00.088 align:middle line:90%
and what was that.

00:05:00.088 --> 00:05:01.723 align:middle line:84%
I know you had Fritz
Albert Pop in here.

00:05:01.723 --> 00:05:03.291 align:middle line:84%
Give us an idea of
what you discovered

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.492 align:middle line:90%
that really turned you on -

00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:07.796 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, I mean, at
one time, an acupuncturist

00:05:07.796 --> 00:05:11.599 align:middle line:84%
in New Zealand asked me to
translate a couple of articles

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.235 align:middle line:90%
from German into English,

00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:16.704 align:middle line:84%
and these German
articles were written

00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:90%
by Fritz Pop [inaudible] -

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.908 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:05:19.908 --> 00:05:22.777 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: And Brickard Helm.

00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:26.147 align:middle line:84%
He was a mathematician
with a proven medically

00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:84%
that we all lived
in 12 dimensions.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.856 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Wolfgang Ludwig, he was
specialist in magnetic fields

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:39.994 align:middle line:84%
and how they influence our body
and our being, and Fritz Pop,

00:05:39.994 --> 00:05:44.999 align:middle line:84%
of course, he discovered
the biophotos,

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.837 align:middle line:90%
and after my discovery there,

00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:54.042 align:middle line:84%
I realized that human
beings were light beings.

00:05:54.042 --> 00:05:57.679 align:middle line:84%
Something which was already
known by the ancient Egyptians

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:00.381 align:middle line:84%
because [inaudible] written
in the hieroglyphics,

00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:02.617 align:middle line:84%
and that those people
were light beings,

00:06:02.617 --> 00:06:05.687 align:middle line:84%
and they thought
with their heart.

00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:06.688 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:08.289 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And they thought
with the mind,

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.891 align:middle line:90%
which is really in the heart.

00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.359 align:middle line:90%
This is the brain.

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:12.594 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:06:12.594 --> 00:06:14.596 align:middle line:84%
Very good point because
it's now coming

00:06:14.596 --> 00:06:16.030 align:middle line:84%
around through other
technologies

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.467 align:middle line:84%
that the understanding
that part of the journey

00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:22.069 align:middle line:84%
of the human right now
is to learn to be able

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.938 align:middle line:84%
to access information
from the heart,

00:06:23.938 --> 00:06:26.507 align:middle line:84%
to listen to the heart
again, which is so clogged

00:06:26.507 --> 00:06:29.310 align:middle line:84%
up with pathways of other
information, disinformation.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.313 align:middle line:84%
Very difficult for us to
intuitively hear ourselves

00:06:32.313 --> 00:06:34.449 align:middle line:90%
in our own bodies anymore.

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:36.517 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:06:36.517 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:84%
Always have to listen
to yourself -

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.021 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:06:40.021 --> 00:06:42.023 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And we are taught to
listen to everybody else,

00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:43.925 align:middle line:84%
but we're not told to
listen to us, and -

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:44.959 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:46.094 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: We are the
only ones that know.

00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:47.362 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:06:47.362 --> 00:06:50.431 align:middle line:84%
I had the pleasure of
interviewing Wolfgang Ludwig,

00:06:50.431 --> 00:06:56.004 align:middle line:84%
you spoke about back in the mid
to late 1980's, around 1986,

00:06:56.004 --> 00:06:56.971 align:middle line:84%
and [inaudible] one
thing he said,

00:06:56.971 --> 00:06:58.172 align:middle line:84%
many things he said
stuck with me.

00:06:58.172 --> 00:06:59.173 align:middle line:90%
It's the first time I turned,

00:06:59.173 --> 00:07:01.042 align:middle line:84%
heard the term bozone
[phonetic].

00:07:01.042 --> 00:07:04.712 align:middle line:84%
No one was using the term
that I had heard of back then.

00:07:04.712 --> 00:07:07.048 align:middle line:84%
The other thing was he was
saying, and we're going to get

00:07:07.048 --> 00:07:11.052 align:middle line:84%
into this in your work that
it all starts in the guts.

00:07:11.052 --> 00:07:13.154 align:middle line:90%
The immune system starts -

00:07:13.154 --> 00:07:14.289 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No.

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.159 align:middle line:84%
The immune system starts
in the hormonal system.

00:07:19.527 --> 00:07:22.030 align:middle line:90%
All the hormonal glands.

00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:30.238 align:middle line:84%
They are guardians, and the
hormonal glands are also the

00:07:30.238 --> 00:07:32.940 align:middle line:84%
physical manifestation
of all the circuits.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.309 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:37.145 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And the circuits are
the gates to the outside world,

00:07:37.145 --> 00:07:43.951 align:middle line:84%
and if the hormonal system,
basically every function

00:07:43.951 --> 00:07:46.321 align:middle line:84%
in the body is going to
[inaudible] hormones,

00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:50.458 align:middle line:84%
and if the hormonal system is
off, then everything goes off.

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:54.194 align:middle line:84%
So in my work, too,
the first thing to do,

00:07:54.194 --> 00:07:56.731 align:middle line:84%
as we do is we [inaudible]
the hormonal system.

00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:58.132 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, that
makes perfect sense.

00:07:58.132 --> 00:08:00.001 align:middle line:84%
All the master glands
are giving the direction

00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:00.868 align:middle line:90%
for every other function -

00:08:00.868 --> 00:08:01.536 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes -

00:08:01.536 --> 00:08:01.936 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In the body.

00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:02.503 align:middle line:90%
So -

00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:03.304 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:08:03.304 --> 00:08:04.238 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And are you, I mean,

00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
there have to be
huge disturbances

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.208 align:middle line:84%
in the hormonal system
just looking around.

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:10.244 align:middle line:84%
By evidence alone, it would
appear the hormonal system

00:08:10.244 --> 00:08:14.916 align:middle line:84%
of even young seemingly healthy
people of a younger age group,

00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:16.517 align:middle line:84%
even there there are
a lot of disturbances

00:08:16.517 --> 00:08:17.418 align:middle line:90%
in the hormonal system.

00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:17.952 align:middle line:90%
So -

00:08:17.952 --> 00:08:19.187 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:08:19.187 --> 00:08:26.728 align:middle line:84%
Everybody really had the
vaccination, has disturbance

00:08:26.728 --> 00:08:28.663 align:middle line:84%
in it, hormonal system
[inaudible]

00:08:28.663 --> 00:08:33.834 align:middle line:84%
which is also very common
in the United States.

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:35.002 align:middle line:90%
It's whiplash.

00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:36.103 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Whiplash?

00:08:36.103 --> 00:08:37.637 align:middle line:84%
And how does that,
what's that have to do

00:08:37.637 --> 00:08:39.040 align:middle line:90%
with the hormones and -

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, if you, normally,
you have one [inaudible] body -

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:42.877 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:43.978 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: If you have
whiplash, you have two.

00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:45.747 align:middle line:90%
One here and one here -

00:08:45.747 --> 00:08:47.148 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh -

00:08:47.148 --> 00:08:49.283 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Here, it's nothing, and
here are two important glands -

00:08:49.283 --> 00:08:50.518 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh -

00:08:50.518 --> 00:08:52.053 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: The parathyroid gland
and the thyroid glands -

00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:53.121 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:55.823 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: If they don't
get energy, I mean,

00:08:55.823 --> 00:08:58.159 align:middle line:84%
it results in major
complications.

00:08:58.159 --> 00:08:59.861 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Is this just
because we're bad drivers,

00:08:59.861 --> 00:09:02.930 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting whiplash as
a result of that, or is it -

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.632 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: That is, might
be one occasion,

00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:10.038 align:middle line:84%
but the other occasion is the
incredible amount of sports.

00:09:10.038 --> 00:09:11.339 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, yes.

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:14.742 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Because you can get
the whiplash from anything.

00:09:14.742 --> 00:09:16.544 align:middle line:90%
From playing football.

00:09:16.544 --> 00:09:18.312 align:middle line:90%
From hockey.

00:09:18.312 --> 00:09:22.316 align:middle line:84%
Any fall or drop
can cause whiplash.

00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:23.851 align:middle line:90%
Even birth can cause whiplash.

00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:25.453 align:middle line:90%
Yoga can cause a whiplash.

00:09:25.453 --> 00:09:29.857 align:middle line:90%
So there are many reasons.

00:09:29.857 --> 00:09:34.362 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I believe that many
reasons for whiplashes,

00:09:34.362 --> 00:09:39.200 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that such a
whiplash condition might also

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.402 align:middle line:90%
result in thyroid problems.

00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:43.738 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:09:43.738 --> 00:09:50.011 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And thyroid problems
might, again, create tumors.

00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:55.116 align:middle line:84%
So and other hormonal
disturbance

00:09:55.116 --> 00:09:58.019 align:middle line:84%
because hormonal glands are
all in touch with each other.

00:09:58.019 --> 00:09:59.353 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:09:59.353 --> 00:10:01.589 align:middle line:84%
We talked off camera, and you
mentioned it a moment ago,

00:10:01.589 --> 00:10:04.826 align:middle line:84%
vaccines, and before
we get into the,

00:10:04.826 --> 00:10:06.761 align:middle line:84%
how you actually
discovered this technology,

00:10:06.761 --> 00:10:07.895 align:middle line:84%
because you've already
brought it up,

00:10:07.895 --> 00:10:09.997 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important
to go there.

00:10:09.997 --> 00:10:13.935 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we load
the body with these vaccines

00:10:13.935 --> 00:10:16.938 align:middle line:84%
in terms of, as you say,
this recognition system

00:10:16.938 --> 00:10:20.374 align:middle line:84%
for whether the body
is well or unwell?

00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:26.647 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, they are really
only I found two vaccines are

00:10:26.647 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:90%
always disturbing the body.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.886 align:middle line:90%
One is the polio vaccine.

00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:34.121 align:middle line:84%
The other one is the
anti-tetanus vaccination -

00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:35.857 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Tetanus, yes.

00:10:35.857 --> 00:10:43.364 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And the polio vaccination
job is to prevent paralysis,

00:10:43.364 --> 00:10:48.202 align:middle line:84%
but what it does do, it
paralyzes, and I don't know

00:10:48.202 --> 00:10:51.973 align:middle line:84%
if it's the only function or is
it the side effect, but polio,

00:10:51.973 --> 00:10:56.377 align:middle line:84%
we always find disturbing
your pituitary gland,

00:10:56.377 --> 00:11:00.181 align:middle line:84%
and your pituitary gland is
the chief gland of your body.

00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:07.121 align:middle line:84%
And the pituitary gland, one of
its functions is discrimination.

00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:08.322 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Discrimination -

00:11:08.322 --> 00:11:12.894 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yeah, between
what's good and what's bad.

00:11:12.894 --> 00:11:16.664 align:middle line:84%
And we also, we're all told not
to discriminate but tolerate,

00:11:16.664 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
but the body says
do exactly opposite.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.136 align:middle line:84%
It must discriminate
and not tolerate.

00:11:22.136 --> 00:11:23.271 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:25.540 align:middle line:84%
It has to be able to use
its own intelligence -

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:26.307 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: To disturb -

00:11:26.307 --> 00:11:27.575 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: To determine, yes -

00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:28.743 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: To [multiple speakers]
anything gone wrong -

00:11:28.743 --> 00:11:29.844 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:11:29.844 --> 00:11:32.513 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And the body
doesn't do that anymore.

00:11:32.513 --> 00:11:36.417 align:middle line:84%
The body, if this
pituitary gland is disturb,

00:11:36.417 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the body does not recognize
that it's being sick.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.355 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take any action.

00:11:41.355 --> 00:11:43.658 align:middle line:90%
The body lets everything go,

00:11:43.658 --> 00:11:48.162 align:middle line:84%
and acute situation
might turn chronic.

00:11:48.162 --> 00:11:51.299 align:middle line:84%
And [inaudible] body still
doesn't take any actions.

00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:55.603 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nowadays, I mean, how
often do you here about fever.

00:11:55.603 --> 00:11:57.338 align:middle line:90%
You don't hear about it anymore.

00:11:57.338 --> 00:12:00.408 align:middle line:84%
It's all being tolerated
[inaudible] fever is a

00:12:00.408 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:90%
body's reaction.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.546 align:middle line:84%
Increase white blood cells
is a body's reaction.

00:12:05.546 --> 00:12:08.249 align:middle line:84%
What's happening or
that's why doctors

00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:12.453 align:middle line:84%
in the blood work cannot
even discover infections

00:12:12.453 --> 00:12:18.693 align:middle line:84%
because humanity has
changed, but medicine has not.

00:12:18.693 --> 00:12:20.328 align:middle line:90%
Medicine is still in a state

00:12:20.328 --> 00:12:22.763 align:middle line:84%
that really it was
200 years ago -

00:12:22.763 --> 00:12:24.799 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, you give an example

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:27.168 align:middle line:84%
of tetanus that's
interesting along that line

00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:29.770 align:middle line:84%
about what tetanus was
originally developed

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.206 align:middle line:90%
for the anti-tetanus shots,

00:12:32.206 --> 00:12:36.177 align:middle line:84%
and then what its
extenuating effects are,

00:12:36.177 --> 00:12:37.845 align:middle line:90%
which is really quite horrible -

00:12:37.845 --> 00:12:38.779 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:39.413 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Please talk
about tetanus -

00:12:39.413 --> 00:12:40.648 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: The, yeah.

00:12:40.648 --> 00:12:43.384 align:middle line:84%
Tetanus was originally a
vaccination for horse dirt.

00:12:43.384 --> 00:12:44.051 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Horse dirt.

00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:44.785 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Horse dirt.

00:12:44.785 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.888 align:middle line:84%
We don't interface with
that by and large now -

00:12:47.888 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:55.329 align:middle line:84%
No, but the, at the time,
it was also street dirt.

00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:56.564 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Street dirt?

00:12:56.564 --> 00:12:57.932 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yeah, because horses
walked in the streets -

00:12:57.932 --> 00:12:59.266 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's common dirt, yeah.

00:12:59.266 --> 00:13:02.036 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So that's what they
started calling it street dirt,

00:13:02.036 --> 00:13:05.640 align:middle line:84%
and that, but, nowadays,
they [inaudible] horses

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.707 align:middle line:90%
in the streets anymore -

00:13:06.707 --> 00:13:07.842 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right -

00:13:07.842 --> 00:13:08.576 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: [Inaudible]
occasion of police horse -

00:13:08.576 --> 00:13:09.844 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:13:09.844 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And, but the thing
that if you step in a nail

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.019 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
get a tetanus shot,

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:20.087 align:middle line:90%
that's absolutely nonsense.

00:13:20.087 --> 00:13:22.923 align:middle line:84%
And what the anti-tetanus
vaccination does,

00:13:22.923 --> 00:13:24.392 align:middle line:90%
and this is known medically,

00:13:24.392 --> 00:13:28.029 align:middle line:84%
that it disrupts the
calcium metabolism.

00:13:28.029 --> 00:13:30.231 align:middle line:90%
So from that moment,

00:13:30.231 --> 00:13:32.433 align:middle line:84%
your calcium metabolism
will do everything wrong

00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:33.734 align:middle line:90%
with the calcium.

00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:36.771 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so how does this
show up as we age in life?

00:13:36.771 --> 00:13:40.508 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: This shows
up by gallstones.

00:13:40.508 --> 00:13:44.178 align:middle line:84%
Gallstones are wrongly
deposited calcium.

00:13:44.178 --> 00:13:48.349 align:middle line:84%
Kidney stone, arteriosclerosis,
hardening of the arteries.

00:13:48.349 --> 00:13:49.917 align:middle line:84%
Because that's calcium
deposit in the artery,

00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:51.419 align:middle line:90%
which shouldn't go there.

00:13:51.419 --> 00:13:53.154 align:middle line:90%
And osteoporosis.

00:13:53.154 --> 00:14:00.728 align:middle line:84%
So calcium metabolism draws
calcium from the bones,

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:02.797 align:middle line:90%
and puts it in everywhere else.

00:14:02.797 --> 00:14:09.937 align:middle line:84%
So giving people calcium
for osteoporosis is nonsense

00:14:09.937 --> 00:14:12.139 align:middle line:84%
because the body still
does the wrong things -

00:14:12.139 --> 00:14:13.474 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:14:13.474 --> 00:14:14.909 align:middle line:84%
It still doesn't have the
correct signal in terms of how

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:16.043 align:middle line:90%
to distribute it and use it.

00:14:16.043 --> 00:14:16.577 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No -

00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:17.578 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:14:17.578 --> 00:14:19.013 align:middle line:84%
So you're just throwing
more junk at it.

00:14:19.013 --> 00:14:20.047 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:14:20.047 --> 00:14:21.315 align:middle line:84%
You're throwing more
junk in the body,

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:25.386 align:middle line:84%
and the body dumps it
everywhere, leading,

00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:27.888 align:middle line:90%
for example, to Parkinson's.

00:14:27.888 --> 00:14:30.491 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That is incorrect calcium
metabolism or [inaudible] -

00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:31.358 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes, yes -

00:14:31.358 --> 00:14:32.727 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Parkinson's -

00:14:32.727 --> 00:14:35.029 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Real Parkinson's, yeah,
the body gets totally stiff.

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:38.599 align:middle line:84%
Gets calcified, and
that is what,

00:14:38.599 --> 00:14:40.901 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, real
Parkinson is.

00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:44.672 align:middle line:84%
There are many people who
have Parkinson symptoms.

00:14:44.672 --> 00:14:46.073 align:middle line:90%
This is not real Parkinson -

00:14:46.073 --> 00:14:50.144 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, when these little
babies are given these cocktails

00:14:50.144 --> 00:14:54.281 align:middle line:84%
of vaccines, does it still
include polio and tetanus -

00:14:54.281 --> 00:14:55.116 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:14:55.116 --> 00:14:56.083 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It does, it does still -

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:57.451 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:14:57.451 --> 00:15:00.554 align:middle line:84%
I believe kids in the US now
get 29 different vaccinations.

00:15:00.554 --> 00:15:02.757 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And, again, off camera
when we were earlier talking

00:15:02.757 --> 00:15:06.127 align:middle line:84%
about this, you said MMR,
measles, mumps, rubella,

00:15:06.127 --> 00:15:08.796 align:middle line:84%
that that doesn't seem to have
a long-term damaging effect

00:15:08.796 --> 00:15:09.330 align:middle line:90%
like the others -

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.397 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No.

00:15:10.397 --> 00:15:14.568 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that,
although rubella seems

00:15:14.568 --> 00:15:16.637 align:middle line:90%
to be the cause of MS.

00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:17.638 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh.

00:15:17.638 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a long-term
damage effect -

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.781 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And, but MMR,
[inaudible] don't exist anymore,

00:15:26.781 --> 00:15:31.252 align:middle line:84%
but now people get, children
get when they call the fourth,

00:15:31.252 --> 00:15:33.621 align:middle line:84%
fifth, and sixth
disease, and they look

00:15:33.621 --> 00:15:35.055 align:middle line:84%
on the Internet and
say [inaudible] -

00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I see.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.127 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: They have,
they say, well,

00:15:40.127 --> 00:15:42.429 align:middle line:84%
people can't get
these disease anymore

00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:45.666 align:middle line:90%
because they are vaccinated.

00:15:45.666 --> 00:15:47.368 align:middle line:84%
True. Still get the
same symptoms -

00:15:47.368 --> 00:15:48.469 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right -

00:15:48.469 --> 00:15:49.503 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And now they
call them fourth, fifth,

00:15:49.503 --> 00:15:52.807 align:middle line:84%
and sixth disease,
but it is the same.

00:15:52.807 --> 00:15:54.708 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When you came
into the building today

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:84%
by a wild coincidence, it turned
that one of the people you saw

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.116 align:middle line:84%
when you first started
developing this technology had

00:16:02.116 --> 00:16:05.586 align:middle line:84%
come back from Rome
with an infection,

00:16:05.586 --> 00:16:08.489 align:middle line:84%
and sought some alternative
technology

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:11.225 align:middle line:84%
out because nothing was really
working to take the fevers down,

00:16:11.225 --> 00:16:13.093 align:middle line:90%
and I said, wait a minute.

00:16:13.093 --> 00:16:15.362 align:middle line:84%
It was a man named Johan
from the Netherlands.

00:16:15.362 --> 00:16:17.331 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the same man
who's here in the building.

00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:20.301 align:middle line:84%
He said it was amazing how
well your technology worked.

00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:21.502 align:middle line:90%
Now this was back in '85 -

00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:22.837 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: In '85, yes -

00:16:22.837 --> 00:16:25.873 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And now my understanding
is you were using some of,

00:16:25.873 --> 00:16:29.210 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned the three men's
work before including this

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.945 align:middle line:90%
Albert Pop and the others.

00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:33.948 align:middle line:84%
You were using some of those
basic theories and such

00:16:33.948 --> 00:16:35.449 align:middle line:84%
when you put together
your first device -

00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:36.016 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes -

00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:37.151 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In 1983.

00:16:37.151 --> 00:16:39.286 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk about
what your thinking was

00:16:39.286 --> 00:16:42.723 align:middle line:84%
and the principle behind
the device you put together?

00:16:42.723 --> 00:16:45.359 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, from everything
I learned from the research

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:50.831 align:middle line:84%
that was done by Fritz Albert
Pop especially, [inaudible] were

00:16:50.831 --> 00:16:52.800 align:middle line:84%
that basically two
different light.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
You have coherent light
[inaudible] chaotic light.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:90%
And my understanding was and is

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.475 align:middle line:84%
that coherent light
is healthy light,

00:17:01.475 --> 00:17:06.479 align:middle line:84%
and the chaotic light
is unhealthy light.

00:17:07.614 --> 00:17:14.654 align:middle line:84%
So I search for ways to
split these light forms.

00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:15.355 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: To split them -

00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:16.023 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: To split them.

00:17:16.023 --> 00:17:17.524 align:middle line:90%
Coherent from the -

00:17:17.524 --> 00:17:19.226 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Incoherent,
chaotic, yeah -

00:17:19.226 --> 00:17:20.561 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Light.

00:17:20.561 --> 00:17:27.133 align:middle line:84%
And I found that there were
filters that could do that.

00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:33.507 align:middle line:84%
And then if that is the cause of
all disease, then the opposite

00:17:33.507 --> 00:17:37.011 align:middle line:84%
of the chaotic should
cure the disease.

00:17:37.011 --> 00:17:43.817 align:middle line:84%
So we introduce a system in
the old instruments, too,

00:17:43.817 --> 00:17:50.591 align:middle line:84%
which inverted the phase
of the chaotic vibrations,

00:17:50.591 --> 00:17:54.094 align:middle line:84%
and then send it
back to the body.

00:17:54.094 --> 00:17:57.364 align:middle line:84%
And because two opposite
waves neutralize each other.

00:17:57.364 --> 00:18:01.702 align:middle line:84%
The disease-causing wave was
automatically neutralized.

00:18:01.702 --> 00:18:05.706 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, it sounds
pretty perfect

00:18:05.706 --> 00:18:08.609 align:middle line:84%
because you're using
information,

00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:12.112 align:middle line:84%
and you're using light
to carry information.

00:18:12.112 --> 00:18:13.414 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:18:13.414 --> 00:18:15.316 align:middle line:84%
Well, the biophotons, in my
opinion, are information -

00:18:15.316 --> 00:18:16.717 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They are the infor,

00:18:16.717 --> 00:18:19.853 align:middle line:84%
just like the sun is delivering
a constant stream of information

00:18:19.853 --> 00:18:20.854 align:middle line:90%
to all living systems -

00:18:20.854 --> 00:18:21.488 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:18:21.488 --> 00:18:22.823 align:middle line:90%
The whole cosmos -

00:18:22.823 --> 00:18:25.659 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The whole cosmos
including every little cell

00:18:25.659 --> 00:18:27.061 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:31.498 align:middle line:84%
Now, when people hear this, one
of the things is, and you were,

00:18:31.498 --> 00:18:33.834 align:middle line:84%
you did understand
and also research some

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:35.936 align:middle line:84%
of the frequency
generation [inaudible]

00:18:35.936 --> 00:18:37.738 align:middle line:84%
such as the Rife
[phonetic] device,

00:18:37.738 --> 00:18:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and as people are listening
to this, they'll say, well,

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.477 align:middle line:84%
what's the difference between
using this biophotonic light

00:18:43.477 --> 00:18:47.481 align:middle line:84%
and, to reverse a symptom
versus uses Rife technology.

00:18:47.481 --> 00:18:50.217 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain the
difference between them?

00:18:50.217 --> 00:18:53.754 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, the
Rife technology,

00:18:53.754 --> 00:19:01.195 align:middle line:84%
Rife sought the frequency of his
bacteria and then bombarded them

00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:03.964 align:middle line:84%
with the same frequency,
thereby blowing them up.

00:19:03.964 --> 00:19:10.304 align:middle line:84%
That was Rife's idea,
and he could look

00:19:10.304 --> 00:19:11.972 align:middle line:84%
at all these different
frequencies

00:19:11.972 --> 00:19:15.509 align:middle line:84%
that would blow the bacteria
up, and there's microscope.

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:16.844 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Right, when
it was intact -

00:19:16.844 --> 00:19:18.879 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: When everything
was intact -

00:19:18.879 --> 00:19:19.813 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:19:19.813 --> 00:19:20.748 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Between the
Rife microscope,

00:19:20.748 --> 00:19:23.317 align:middle line:84%
they had not been
able to restore.

00:19:23.317 --> 00:19:27.888 align:middle line:84%
So and a lot of people
still go on Rife's

00:19:27.888 --> 00:19:29.490 align:middle line:90%
of frequency [inaudible].

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But, again, everything
has changed.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.362 align:middle line:84%
I mean, no bacteria
will stay the same -

00:19:35.362 --> 00:19:36.730 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right -

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.399 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: It changes every two
seconds or every one second -

00:19:38.399 --> 00:19:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And our bodies,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.136 align:middle line:84%
our cellular beings must
have changed since then -

00:19:42.136 --> 00:19:43.370 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:50.077 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and the frequencies,
for example, a bacteria.

00:19:50.077 --> 00:19:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Rife could see what
frequency would kill,

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.014 align:middle line:90%
blow up the bacteria.

00:19:54.014 --> 00:19:56.417 align:middle line:84%
He would see [inaudible]
in the microscope.

00:19:56.417 --> 00:20:03.724 align:middle line:84%
Now frequency is not
the same as information.

00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:05.959 align:middle line:84%
If you listen to
a radio station,

00:20:05.959 --> 00:20:09.663 align:middle line:84%
it broadcast this
particular frequency,

00:20:09.663 --> 00:20:11.899 align:middle line:84%
but if I generate
this frequency,

00:20:11.899 --> 00:20:13.901 align:middle line:90%
I don't get the same information

00:20:13.901 --> 00:20:15.569 align:middle line:84%
as I listen to the
radio station.

00:20:15.569 --> 00:20:16.804 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:20:16.804 --> 00:20:18.706 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Because the radio
station has this frequency.

00:20:18.706 --> 00:20:22.076 align:middle line:84%
This is a carrier wave,
and on top of that,

00:20:22.076 --> 00:20:26.180 align:middle line:84%
they modulate the music, and
the music is information,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.549 align:middle line:84%
which is very different
from the carrier wave.

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:29.683 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:20:29.683 --> 00:20:31.685 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So we don't deal
with the carrier wave.

00:20:31.685 --> 00:20:34.188 align:middle line:90%
We only deal with information.

00:20:34.188 --> 00:20:37.391 align:middle line:84%
Information must be neutralized,
not the carrier wave.

00:20:37.391 --> 00:20:38.659 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, and
it is interesting.

00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:41.295 align:middle line:84%
As you say, bacteria are
changing by the moment, no less,

00:20:41.295 --> 00:20:44.565 align:middle line:90%
from 1920, 30, and 40 -

00:20:44.565 --> 00:20:45.232 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes -

00:20:45.232 --> 00:20:46.333 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Up until now.

00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:49.336 align:middle line:84%
And so the calibrations
as a result of using

00:20:49.336 --> 00:20:52.673 align:middle line:84%
that pristine microscope
and that particular lens

00:20:52.673 --> 00:20:55.476 align:middle line:84%
on the universal scope, which
doesn't exist at this time,

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:58.779 align:middle line:84%
although there, it is being
redone now, apparently -

00:20:58.779 --> 00:20:59.313 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: They say, yeah -

00:20:59.313 --> 00:21:00.647 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:21:00.647 --> 00:21:02.349 align:middle line:84%
So, apparently, they are
recreating that and even better,

00:21:02.349 --> 00:21:05.018 align:middle line:84%
but until that time, we
can't see the new range

00:21:05.018 --> 00:21:06.854 align:middle line:90%
of bacterial frequencies.

00:21:06.854 --> 00:21:08.255 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No, you can't see them -

00:21:08.255 --> 00:21:10.324 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so what's happening
when you use a Rife device now?

00:21:10.324 --> 00:21:13.994 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I think they bombard
anybody with all kind

00:21:13.994 --> 00:21:18.165 align:middle line:84%
of frequency, and if they
hit something or not.

00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:20.434 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it's kind of a
broad-based explosive -

00:21:20.434 --> 00:21:21.435 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Well, I mean, yeah -

00:21:21.435 --> 00:21:22.703 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You know,
vibrational explosive -

00:21:22.703 --> 00:21:24.037 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah, and dynamite.

00:21:24.037 --> 00:21:25.339 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:26.974 align:middle line:84%
A little bit dynamite hoping
you get the ending that -

00:21:26.974 --> 00:21:28.442 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yeah, but if
you blow something up,

00:21:28.442 --> 00:21:29.676 align:middle line:90%
you get all the debris -

00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:31.078 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:21:31.078 --> 00:21:36.283 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now, you say that it's not
about blowing up the bacteria -

00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:37.417 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No -

00:21:37.417 --> 00:21:38.619 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I know a lot
of people have received,

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:41.021 align:middle line:84%
when it was done correctly
and calibrated correctly

00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:43.557 align:middle line:84%
for the body and bacteria
of the day, they were able

00:21:43.557 --> 00:21:46.193 align:middle line:84%
to cure cancer and reverse
all kinds of disease,

00:21:46.193 --> 00:21:47.895 align:middle line:90%
blowing up specific bacteria.

00:21:47.895 --> 00:21:50.964 align:middle line:84%
Not a whole minefield
of different bacteria,

00:21:50.964 --> 00:21:52.733 align:middle line:90%
but specific bacteria,

00:21:52.733 --> 00:21:58.539 align:middle line:84%
but you're saying using
our own biophotonic light,

00:21:58.539 --> 00:22:00.874 align:middle line:84%
we can actually change
the behavior

00:22:00.874 --> 00:22:03.143 align:middle line:84%
of even the most
aggressive, nasty,

00:22:03.143 --> 00:22:04.545 align:middle line:90%
life-threatening bacteria -

00:22:04.545 --> 00:22:05.379 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes.

00:22:05.379 --> 00:22:06.280 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And explain that to us.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.114 align:middle line:90%
Take some time -

00:22:07.114 --> 00:22:08.315 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Well, in the first place,

00:22:08.315 --> 00:22:12.486 align:middle line:84%
Louis Pasteur [inaudible]
he said don't bother

00:22:12.486 --> 00:22:14.154 align:middle line:90%
about the bacteria.

00:22:14.154 --> 00:22:15.155 align:middle line:90%
Look at the terrain.

00:22:15.155 --> 00:22:16.323 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:22:16.323 --> 00:22:17.157 align:middle line:90%
The blood.

00:22:17.157 --> 00:22:18.458 align:middle line:90%
The health of the blood and -

00:22:18.458 --> 00:22:19.459 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: The veins.

00:22:19.459 --> 00:22:20.961 align:middle line:90%
The body's own light -

00:22:20.961 --> 00:22:22.296 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:22:22.296 --> 00:22:25.165 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: You have to look at
that method at the [inaudible]

00:22:25.165 --> 00:22:31.471 align:middle line:84%
and convince that if you have,
for example, helio bacteria,

00:22:31.471 --> 00:22:34.074 align:middle line:90%
which are said to cause ulcers.

00:22:34.074 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Because they often are
seen together, and -

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.477 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What's it called?

00:22:37.477 --> 00:22:38.445 align:middle line:90%
Helio -

00:22:38.445 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Helio bacteria -

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.547 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Helio bacteria -

00:22:40.547 --> 00:22:41.081 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: [inaudible]

00:22:41.081 --> 00:22:42.015 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK -

00:22:42.015 --> 00:22:43.817 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: That's, but
they often find

00:22:43.817 --> 00:22:46.253 align:middle line:84%
in the stomach together
with all sorts.

00:22:46.253 --> 00:22:49.723 align:middle line:84%
And they say the bacteria
causes the stomach ulcer.

00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:52.793 align:middle line:84%
But the stomach ulcer
already exists,

00:22:52.793 --> 00:22:57.064 align:middle line:90%
and then attracts the bacteria.

00:22:57.064 --> 00:23:03.103 align:middle line:84%
And then to increase
the symptoms.

00:23:03.103 --> 00:23:07.007 align:middle line:84%
Because, but the symptoms
are, like, the flashing light

00:23:07.007 --> 00:23:08.709 align:middle line:90%
on top of a police car.

00:23:08.709 --> 00:23:13.413 align:middle line:84%
The flashing lights are there to
attract attention to police car,

00:23:13.413 --> 00:23:17.551 align:middle line:84%
and [inaudible] flashing
light, but you don't have

00:23:17.551 --> 00:23:20.821 align:middle line:84%
to [inaudible] the flashing
light because that does go away.

00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:22.689 align:middle line:90%
The police car is still driving.

00:23:22.689 --> 00:23:23.991 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:23:23.991 --> 00:23:26.326 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So you have to always
look what is underneath -

00:23:26.326 --> 00:23:28.829 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So the light goes
in with the information,

00:23:28.829 --> 00:23:32.132 align:middle line:90%
takes the bacteria like e-coli.

00:23:32.132 --> 00:23:32.699 align:middle line:90%
We -

00:23:32.699 --> 00:23:33.767 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:23:33.767 --> 00:23:35.068 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's one
thing you talk about -

00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:38.105 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: We, yeah, we tried in
the research at University

00:23:38.105 --> 00:23:40.240 align:middle line:90%
of Auckland, New Zealand.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:46.947 align:middle line:84%
We had a tissue culture, and we
put e-coli bacteria in there.

00:23:46.947 --> 00:23:51.118 align:middle line:84%
They started then doing
damage to the tissue.

00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:53.754 align:middle line:84%
Then we [inaudible]
treatment device.

00:23:53.754 --> 00:23:56.857 align:middle line:90%
We put electrodes in the tissue,

00:23:56.857 --> 00:23:59.493 align:middle line:84%
which opposite e-coli
information -

00:23:59.493 --> 00:24:00.627 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:24:00.627 --> 00:24:02.562 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And we did
two minute treatment,

00:24:02.562 --> 00:24:06.767 align:middle line:84%
and after two minutes, e-coli
bacteria was still there,

00:24:06.767 --> 00:24:08.669 align:middle line:90%
but were not damaging anymore.

00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:11.204 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So that's interesting
because we are made of bacteria.

00:24:11.204 --> 00:24:12.906 align:middle line:84%
[multiple speakers]
Bacteria's our friend as well.

00:24:12.906 --> 00:24:14.007 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Bacteria is our friend -

00:24:14.007 --> 00:24:14.941 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah -

00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: They have
to be in, I mean,

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.211 align:middle line:84%
if you look at your
intestinal bacteria -

00:24:18.211 --> 00:24:19.313 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:24:19.313 --> 00:24:20.614 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: They have to
be in your intestines.

00:24:20.614 --> 00:24:22.382 align:middle line:90%
They can't go anywhere else.

00:24:22.382 --> 00:24:23.684 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:24:23.684 --> 00:24:28.755 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: If they go anywhere
else because of infections.

00:24:28.755 --> 00:24:31.191 align:middle line:90%
Say if you have appendicitis.

00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:37.397 align:middle line:84%
It starts in the appendix,
but it doesn't stay there.

00:24:37.397 --> 00:24:41.001 align:middle line:84%
The moment it turns
chronic, it starts spreading

00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:44.504 align:middle line:84%
of the [inaudible]
small intestine.

00:24:44.504 --> 00:24:46.340 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, now, you have
some stories about that.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.176 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about, let's
take one antidotal case

00:24:49.176 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:90%
of that woman from -

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.178 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Belgium -

00:24:51.178 --> 00:24:51.745 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Belgium -

00:24:51.745 --> 00:24:53.013 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:24:53.013 --> 00:24:55.048 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and talk about
her situation so we can -

00:24:55.048 --> 00:25:00.854 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, she had
abdominal pain for 15 years.

00:25:00.854 --> 00:25:05.158 align:middle line:84%
And the normal medical
intervention and [inaudible],

00:25:05.158 --> 00:25:07.260 align:middle line:84%
they couldn't do
anything about it.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:15.001 align:middle line:84%
And somehow she came to me, and
at that time, I measured her,

00:25:15.001 --> 00:25:19.106 align:middle line:84%
and I immediately said, oh,
it's all up in the [inaudible].

00:25:19.106 --> 00:25:22.175 align:middle line:84%
And then [inaudible] I
talked for 15 years wrong,

00:25:22.175 --> 00:25:27.481 align:middle line:84%
and he couldn't believe
it because he research.

00:25:27.481 --> 00:25:30.851 align:middle line:84%
He did blood work, and he
couldn't find any number

00:25:30.851 --> 00:25:32.352 align:middle line:90%
of increased liposites.

00:25:32.352 --> 00:25:34.855 align:middle line:84%
There is no increase
[inaudible] according

00:25:34.855 --> 00:25:35.555 align:middle line:90%
to [multiple speakers].

00:25:35.555 --> 00:25:37.491 align:middle line:90%
There is no infection.

00:25:37.491 --> 00:25:38.925 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:25:38.925 --> 00:25:43.563 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: But I said it is, and
her appendix had gone from acute

00:25:43.563 --> 00:25:45.766 align:middle line:90%
to chronic to necrotizing.

00:25:45.766 --> 00:25:47.033 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, goodness, yeah.

00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:48.635 align:middle line:90%
So she was having a lot of pain.

00:25:48.635 --> 00:25:49.202 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:25:49.202 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:90%
I mean, and -

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.039 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But her doctor refused
to remove the appendix.

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:59.346 align:middle line:84%
You, didn't you suggest you
need to get this thing out?

00:25:59.346 --> 00:26:05.786 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: My experience shows me
that if this is the appendix,

00:26:05.786 --> 00:26:11.725 align:middle line:84%
and if it's necrotized until
here, this part is still alive.

00:26:11.725 --> 00:26:13.360 align:middle line:84%
I can heal the complete
appendix.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.628 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:26:14.628 --> 00:26:17.097 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: But I, because I
can see it's necrotizing,

00:26:17.097 --> 00:26:18.832 align:middle line:90%
but I can't see how much it is -

00:26:18.832 --> 00:26:19.933 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:26:19.933 --> 00:26:21.768 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So I had to, I
did five treatments,

00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:24.371 align:middle line:90%
and in five treatments,

00:26:24.371 --> 00:26:27.441 align:middle line:84%
I normally can clear
the complete appendix -

00:26:27.441 --> 00:26:28.542 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right -

00:26:28.542 --> 00:26:30.877 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: But in the, after
the sixth treatment,

00:26:30.877 --> 00:26:32.746 align:middle line:84%
it's still [inaudible]
then get it out -

00:26:32.746 --> 00:26:35.081 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's gone, yeah.

00:26:35.081 --> 00:26:39.853 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And I told this woman
that, and she went back

00:26:39.853 --> 00:26:43.457 align:middle line:84%
to her doctor, and he still
refused her, and by this time,

00:26:43.457 --> 00:26:46.226 align:middle line:84%
her whole appendix
area was swollen,

00:26:46.226 --> 00:26:49.496 align:middle line:90%
and he still refused it.

00:26:49.496 --> 00:26:51.898 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I wrote
a letter to his doctor.

00:26:51.898 --> 00:26:54.601 align:middle line:84%
I said this appendix
needs to come out now.

00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:57.771 align:middle line:84%
And then with this letter, she
took it back to the doctor,

00:26:57.771 --> 00:27:01.141 align:middle line:84%
and then [inaudible]
to take it out.

00:27:01.141 --> 00:27:04.611 align:middle line:84%
And when he took it out,
he was totally surprised.

00:27:04.611 --> 00:27:07.147 align:middle line:84%
He said a totally
[inaudible] appendix.

00:27:07.147 --> 00:27:08.381 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, gone.

00:27:08.381 --> 00:27:10.684 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Gone and [inaudible]
not showing anything.

00:27:10.684 --> 00:27:11.384 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: In the blood -

00:27:11.384 --> 00:27:12.786 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: In the blood.

00:27:12.786 --> 00:27:15.021 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's where blood
panels just totally fail -

00:27:15.021 --> 00:27:24.097 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: They fail completely, and
that, this doctor then went to,

00:27:25.165 --> 00:27:27.267 align:middle line:84%
because he was a
surgeon, he start looking

00:27:27.267 --> 00:27:30.070 align:middle line:84%
at other appendixes, and
he found that 70 percent

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.839 align:middle line:84%
of old people walk around
with a chronically infected

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.207 align:middle line:90%
appendixes -

00:27:34.207 --> 00:27:36.076 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Seventy percent have
chronically infected appendixes.

00:27:36.076 --> 00:27:38.979 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: That cause
a lot of allergy.

00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Like celiac disease,
like [inaudible] disease.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:41.615 align:middle line:90%
I mean, -

00:27:41.615 --> 00:27:43.016 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, there's an example.

00:27:43.016 --> 00:27:44.851 align:middle line:84%
One article I read on your work
was talking about a little girl

00:27:44.851 --> 00:27:47.187 align:middle line:84%
who was allergic to
60 different things.

00:27:47.187 --> 00:27:48.321 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes -

00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:49.789 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And her mother
found her way to you -

00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:53.693 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, at the
very, very, very end.

00:27:53.693 --> 00:27:57.898 align:middle line:84%
That's when the little girl
was about a week from dying.

00:27:57.898 --> 00:28:00.433 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the thing
is, just to say this,

00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:01.568 align:middle line:90%
that's how a lot of people are.

00:28:01.568 --> 00:28:02.802 align:middle line:84%
By the time they find
their way to you,

00:28:02.802 --> 00:28:04.304 align:middle line:84%
it's because they've
already exhausted everything,

00:28:04.304 --> 00:28:05.338 align:middle line:90%
and they're really sick -

00:28:05.338 --> 00:28:06.172 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes -

00:28:06.172 --> 00:28:07.107 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And you take those on -

00:28:07.107 --> 00:28:08.441 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Oh, yeah -

00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:09.142 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so this little
girl was [multiple speakers].

00:28:09.142 --> 00:28:10.644 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's all you get.

00:28:10.644 --> 00:28:11.578 align:middle line:90%
I mean, what a shame.

00:28:11.578 --> 00:28:12.779 align:middle line:84%
If you just can't,
if someone came

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:14.915 align:middle line:84%
and used these subtle
therapies to begin with,

00:28:14.915 --> 00:28:16.249 align:middle line:84%
you would never have
to get that bad -

00:28:16.249 --> 00:28:17.417 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: You'd never
have to get that bad -

00:28:17.417 --> 00:28:18.685 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:28:18.685 --> 00:28:20.287 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happened with this little girl.

00:28:20.287 --> 00:28:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, she'd been,
she was three years old.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:28.929 align:middle line:84%
She'd been sick for three
years from birth onwards,

00:28:28.929 --> 00:28:31.398 align:middle line:84%
and she was getting
more and more allergic.

00:28:31.398 --> 00:28:34.334 align:middle line:84%
She was allergic to 60
different food substance.

00:28:34.334 --> 00:28:36.937 align:middle line:84%
She could only eat food,
five different food,

00:28:36.937 --> 00:28:39.339 align:middle line:84%
and then she got the chicken
pox, and after chicken pox,

00:28:39.339 --> 00:28:40.507 align:middle line:84%
she couldn't eat
anything anymore -

00:28:40.507 --> 00:28:41.308 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, boy.

00:28:41.308 --> 00:28:42.275 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:42.275 --> 00:28:47.447 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And that when
her mother heard

00:28:47.447 --> 00:28:49.683 align:middle line:90%
about me because, from a friend.

00:28:49.683 --> 00:28:55.622 align:middle line:84%
They said you need to go there,
and I treated, I diagnosed

00:28:55.622 --> 00:28:58.858 align:middle line:84%
or asked her body what
was wrong with it.

00:28:58.858 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And that was, it was
not appendicitis,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.335 align:middle line:84%
but it was a very bad
case of salmonella.

00:29:08.335 --> 00:29:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And I did my treatment, and I
told the parents in three days,

00:29:18.244 --> 00:29:20.647 align:middle line:90%
she can eat everything again,

00:29:20.647 --> 00:29:22.415 align:middle line:84%
and the parents said
[inaudible] -

00:29:22.415 --> 00:29:23.083 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, right -

00:29:23.083 --> 00:29:23.717 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: He is crazy -

00:29:23.717 --> 00:29:25.852 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:29:25.852 --> 00:29:29.589 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: But because the child
changed completely immediately

00:29:29.589 --> 00:29:31.891 align:middle line:84%
after treatment, she got
the color back in her face

00:29:31.891 --> 00:29:34.227 align:middle line:90%
and everything [inaudible].

00:29:34.227 --> 00:29:38.031 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, child
felt a lot better,

00:29:38.031 --> 00:29:42.836 align:middle line:84%
and one of the things that got
immediate reactions was yogurt.

00:29:42.836 --> 00:29:46.940 align:middle line:84%
So I thought they immediately
got lung infections and -

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.041 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:49.042 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And the child,
the parents decided

00:29:49.042 --> 00:29:51.011 align:middle line:84%
to give the child
a spoon of yogurt,

00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:54.547 align:middle line:84%
and they immediately went
with the ear to their chest.

00:29:54.547 --> 00:29:59.119 align:middle line:84%
Nothing happened, and they gave
her more yogurt and more yogurt.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:01.087 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happened.

00:30:01.087 --> 00:30:04.758 align:middle line:84%
And that day she ate
one liter of yogurt -

00:30:04.758 --> 00:30:06.159 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, my gosh.

00:30:06.159 --> 00:30:08.495 align:middle line:84%
And how long before she could
eat a whole spectrum of foods -

00:30:08.495 --> 00:30:13.199 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And then two
days later they started

00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:15.602 align:middle line:90%
to give her gluten, bread.

00:30:15.602 --> 00:30:17.137 align:middle line:90%
No reactions.

00:30:17.137 --> 00:30:19.205 align:middle line:90%
So from that moment onwards,

00:30:19.205 --> 00:30:21.074 align:middle line:84%
she could eat almost
everything again.

00:30:21.074 --> 00:30:26.012 align:middle line:84%
And in the, I think in the first
session, I think 90 percent

00:30:26.012 --> 00:30:28.114 align:middle line:84%
of the problems were
solved in the child,

00:30:28.114 --> 00:30:29.215 align:middle line:90%
and [multiple speakers].

00:30:29.215 --> 00:30:31.685 align:middle line:84%
I mean, children have
the great advantage

00:30:31.685 --> 00:30:34.087 align:middle line:90%
that they react so fast.

00:30:34.087 --> 00:30:35.455 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:30:35.455 --> 00:30:39.592 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, I think children,
animals, they react so fast,

00:30:39.592 --> 00:30:41.828 align:middle line:84%
and I think they have
one thing in common.

00:30:41.828 --> 00:30:43.263 align:middle line:90%
They do not think.

00:30:43.263 --> 00:30:45.198 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They do not think
they have no resistance,

00:30:45.198 --> 00:30:46.399 align:middle line:90%
no belief systems -

00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:48.234 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Because very often,
the head is in the way -

00:30:48.234 --> 00:30:49.202 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:30:49.202 --> 00:30:51.037 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, and you,
not only that,

00:30:51.037 --> 00:30:54.808 align:middle line:84%
you've done experimentation
with plants and also with foods,

00:30:54.808 --> 00:30:57.944 align:middle line:84%
and foods maintain their
freshness much, much longer.

00:30:57.944 --> 00:30:59.979 align:middle line:84%
So, and, again, no
belief systems, you know,

00:30:59.979 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:84%
on the part of yogurt
or a head of lettuce.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:08.922 align:middle line:84%
And your first, as I recall,
your first patient that came

00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:13.593 align:middle line:84%
to a, patient case that came
to you was for liver cancer.

00:31:13.593 --> 00:31:14.694 align:middle line:90%
Now a lot of people listening

00:31:14.694 --> 00:31:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to this think can it
actually reverse cancer.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.966 align:middle line:84%
Can you use your own body's
light to reverse cancer?

00:31:19.966 --> 00:31:23.369 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about the fellow
with the liver cancer and the -

00:31:23.369 --> 00:31:28.641 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, cancer, what we
call cancer is not cancer.

00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:34.681 align:middle line:84%
When we see a tumor, we
call it cancer, but a tumor,

00:31:34.681 --> 00:31:37.650 align:middle line:84%
even if it's malignant,
it is a symptom

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.519 align:middle line:84%
of the disease that
we call cancer.

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:48.595 align:middle line:84%
I mean, liver cancer is a,
it's generally a lot of toxins.

00:31:50.196 --> 00:31:56.202 align:middle line:84%
The liver, as we know, is, one
of its jobs is detoxifying.

00:31:56.202 --> 00:31:58.037 align:middle line:90%
It has to keep all the toxins.

00:31:58.037 --> 00:31:59.072 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:31:59.072 --> 00:32:00.440 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: And at one point,

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:05.512 align:middle line:84%
the liver brings its toxins
together and encapsulates it.

00:32:05.512 --> 00:32:08.381 align:middle line:84%
Now, then, the liver
has a bag of toxins.

00:32:08.381 --> 00:32:17.957 align:middle line:84%
And then we might [inaudible]
because then [inaudible].

00:32:19.325 --> 00:32:25.064 align:middle line:84%
It's the same point, directing
all the formation of tumors

00:32:25.064 --> 00:32:27.667 align:middle line:84%
to [inaudible] from one
place to the other place.

00:32:27.667 --> 00:32:29.402 align:middle line:90%
They don't spread horizontally.

00:32:29.402 --> 00:32:31.771 align:middle line:90%
They all are created anew.

00:32:31.771 --> 00:32:34.774 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So where would that
liver tumor be coming from?

00:32:34.774 --> 00:32:36.309 align:middle line:90%
The original toxic -

00:32:36.309 --> 00:32:37.343 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:32:37.343 --> 00:32:38.745 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a very
toxic environment.

00:32:38.745 --> 00:32:42.615 align:middle line:84%
And liver cancer, I see, is
a self-protection mechanism

00:32:42.615 --> 00:32:48.354 align:middle line:84%
of the body to protect the
body from a lot of toxins.

00:32:48.354 --> 00:32:52.792 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, the cause of
liver cancer is very different

00:32:52.792 --> 00:32:57.497 align:middle line:84%
than the cause of a fibrous
tumor, for example, [inaudible].

00:32:57.497 --> 00:33:00.433 align:middle line:84%
A fibrous tumor is always
caused by the thyroid,

00:33:00.433 --> 00:33:03.970 align:middle line:84%
and liver cancer's
caused by the pituitary.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:09.209 align:middle line:84%
And a [inaudible] cancer is
caused by the circulation.

00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:09.909 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: By the what?

00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Circulation -

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.878 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Circulation, OK.

00:33:11.878 --> 00:33:15.114 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: OK, and what is
prostate is basically the same

00:33:15.114 --> 00:33:16.716 align:middle line:90%
as a [inaudible] cyst.

00:33:16.716 --> 00:33:17.917 align:middle line:90%
It's also a cyst.

00:33:17.917 --> 00:33:21.421 align:middle line:84%
It gets enlarged by
increasing fluids -

00:33:21.421 --> 00:33:22.622 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK -

00:33:22.622 --> 00:33:23.756 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And if you are
getting increasing fluids,

00:33:23.756 --> 00:33:26.392 align:middle line:84%
it means that your
circulation [inaudible] -

00:33:26.392 --> 00:33:27.360 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.395 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And it means
that the valves

00:33:29.395 --> 00:33:33.032 align:middle line:84%
in the veins [inaudible]
have the possibility

00:33:33.032 --> 00:33:35.735 align:middle line:90%
of pushing [inaudible] back,

00:33:35.735 --> 00:33:40.139 align:middle line:84%
and then because
[inaudible] at the bottom.

00:33:40.139 --> 00:33:45.678 align:middle line:84%
That's gravity [inaudible] if
you have a cyst in your breast

00:33:45.678 --> 00:33:48.147 align:middle line:84%
or ovarian cyst or a
[inaudible] prostate,

00:33:48.147 --> 00:33:50.817 align:middle line:90%
it's all a circulation problem.

00:33:50.817 --> 00:33:53.019 align:middle line:90%
And why does this circulation?

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:54.287 align:middle line:90%
It's not good anymore.

00:33:54.287 --> 00:33:57.924 align:middle line:84%
Why? Very often, it's
exhaustion of the adrenal glands

00:33:57.924 --> 00:34:01.294 align:middle line:84%
or it can be calcification
of the artery, of the valves.

00:34:01.294 --> 00:34:03.563 align:middle line:84%
There's calcium stuck
between the valves.

00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:05.598 align:middle line:84%
Then the valves can't
move properly.

00:34:05.598 --> 00:34:09.903 align:middle line:84%
And then you also get
problems like this -

00:34:09.903 --> 00:34:12.105 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting, yes -

00:34:12.105 --> 00:34:14.773 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So you have to look
at the [inaudible], I mean,

00:34:14.773 --> 00:34:19.579 align:middle line:84%
and always have to go by
what does the body tell you.

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:23.883 align:middle line:90%
And you can't project anything.

00:34:23.883 --> 00:34:26.886 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When, so when you
have a situation like that

00:34:26.886 --> 00:34:30.056 align:middle line:84%
with the tumors, is
it like the appendix?

00:34:30.056 --> 00:34:32.692 align:middle line:84%
Is it in that most
of them can be,

00:34:32.692 --> 00:34:35.494 align:middle line:84%
most of the information
can be reversed in -

00:34:35.494 --> 00:34:36.329 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: I mean, -

00:34:36.329 --> 00:34:37.664 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Cancerous situations -

00:34:37.664 --> 00:34:41.099 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, if you have
the example of liver cancer -

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:42.201 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:43.703 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, it's
almost always toxins.

00:34:43.703 --> 00:34:44.737 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:34:44.737 --> 00:34:48.775 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And then you
need to detoxify,

00:34:48.775 --> 00:34:53.179 align:middle line:84%
and these tumors can all the
reversed, especially, I mean,

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:57.150 align:middle line:84%
if there are, before
they are hardened.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:02.855 align:middle line:84%
Because this system is wonderful
for functional disturbances.

00:35:02.855 --> 00:35:04.123 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:35:04.123 --> 00:35:07.126 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: But the moment a
functional disturbance becomes

00:35:07.126 --> 00:35:09.495 align:middle line:84%
[inaudible], then it
becomes far more difficult -

00:35:09.495 --> 00:35:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.598 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: For the body to handle -

00:35:11.598 --> 00:35:13.032 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because you're
talking about something then,

00:35:13.032 --> 00:35:14.334 align:middle line:90%
it seems it's so dense.

00:35:14.334 --> 00:35:15.802 align:middle line:90%
It can, the subtle energies

00:35:15.802 --> 00:35:18.204 align:middle line:84%
of light aren't really
operating the same.

00:35:18.204 --> 00:35:19.772 align:middle line:90%
It stays coherent or -

00:35:19.772 --> 00:35:20.473 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No, I mean, the -

00:35:20.473 --> 00:35:21.507 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Or incoherent.

00:35:21.507 --> 00:35:23.042 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yeah, but it
stays incoherent -

00:35:23.042 --> 00:35:24.344 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:35:24.344 --> 00:35:30.516 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And everything in the
universe moves in spirals,

00:35:30.516 --> 00:35:34.887 align:middle line:84%
and then at the bottom of the
spirals, they get manifested -

00:35:34.887 --> 00:35:35.922 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:35:35.922 --> 00:35:40.393 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Now, if you
process is working,

00:35:40.393 --> 00:35:42.962 align:middle line:84%
you want to reverse
this process.

00:35:42.962 --> 00:35:44.330 align:middle line:90%
You have to reverse [inaudible].

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:48.568 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So in cancer, you
have to reverse the spiral -

00:35:48.568 --> 00:35:49.302 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: You have to -

00:35:49.302 --> 00:35:49.802 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Direction.

00:35:49.802 --> 00:35:50.336 align:middle line:90%
Yes -

00:35:50.336 --> 00:35:51.537 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:35:51.537 --> 00:35:54.874 align:middle line:84%
You also have to, because
if you get this spiral,

00:35:54.874 --> 00:35:57.176 align:middle line:90%
it always moves in vortex.

00:35:57.176 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But when it gets to the
manifestation point,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.582 align:middle line:90%
it goes the other way around.

00:36:02.582 --> 00:36:05.118 align:middle line:90%
It gets dematerialized.

00:36:05.118 --> 00:36:10.323 align:middle line:84%
And you can only dematerialize
things if you take pressure off.

00:36:10.323 --> 00:36:14.394 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 90 percent of
all cancers are happening

00:36:14.394 --> 00:36:16.529 align:middle line:84%
after periods of
intensive stress,

00:36:16.529 --> 00:36:18.998 align:middle line:90%
and stress means pressure.

00:36:18.998 --> 00:36:22.335 align:middle line:84%
And especially in the United
States, but everywhere

00:36:22.335 --> 00:36:23.603 align:middle line:90%
across the world,

00:36:23.603 --> 00:36:27.440 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing
more and more pressure.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.841 align:middle line:90%
And -

00:36:28.841 --> 00:36:31.811 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So how does this, then,
affect the spin of the energy

00:36:31.811 --> 00:36:35.148 align:middle line:84%
that creates the tumors to
go into this chaotic pattern?

00:36:35.148 --> 00:36:36.349 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Performance pressure.

00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Exhaust your adrenalines.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.621 align:middle line:84%
And then if your
adrenalines are exhausted,

00:36:41.621 --> 00:36:43.322 align:middle line:84%
your kidneys start
malfunctioning.

00:36:43.322 --> 00:36:45.425 align:middle line:90%
The heart starts malfunctioning.

00:36:45.425 --> 00:36:47.093 align:middle line:90%
You get numerous problems just

00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:49.429 align:middle line:84%
by exhausting your
adrenal glands.

00:36:49.429 --> 00:36:51.097 align:middle line:90%
And that will -

00:36:51.097 --> 00:36:54.867 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So the technology
that you've created,

00:36:54.867 --> 00:36:57.437 align:middle line:84%
can it fortify the adrenal
glands, for example, -

00:36:57.437 --> 00:36:58.538 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Oh, yeah.

00:36:58.538 --> 00:36:59.972 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I mean, once we,
what I said before.

00:36:59.972 --> 00:37:02.575 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first
thing we do is we clean

00:37:02.575 --> 00:37:03.643 align:middle line:84%
up the whole [inaudible]
system -

00:37:03.643 --> 00:37:04.811 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right -

00:37:04.811 --> 00:37:05.712 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: When we say
adrenal glands are a part -

00:37:05.712 --> 00:37:06.712 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:37:06.712 --> 00:37:08.714 align:middle line:84%
OK. So I have some
questions on that.

00:37:08.714 --> 00:37:11.551 align:middle line:84%
How do you, I mean, we talked
about how Wright was able

00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:13.419 align:middle line:90%
to determine the frequency

00:37:13.419 --> 00:37:16.589 align:middle line:84%
of the bacteria before he used
the electrical frequencies

00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:17.824 align:middle line:90%
to blow it up.

00:37:17.824 --> 00:37:22.695 align:middle line:84%
How do you determine the
source of a disease or the,

00:37:22.695 --> 00:37:25.064 align:middle line:84%
what the symptoms
are emanating from so

00:37:25.064 --> 00:37:27.300 align:middle line:90%
that you can get to the source?

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.368 align:middle line:84%
What is the diagnostic
process like?

00:37:29.368 --> 00:37:31.971 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: It's following logic.

00:37:31.971 --> 00:37:40.313 align:middle line:84%
If you have a, say, a bladder
infection, OK, then I am going

00:37:40.313 --> 00:37:45.318 align:middle line:84%
to see, I'm going to ask
your body what causes this

00:37:45.318 --> 00:37:47.120 align:middle line:90%
bladder infection.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.856 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] I ask the body
to give me information.

00:37:49.856 --> 00:37:51.958 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Now, do you do
this through technology

00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:53.326 align:middle line:84%
or through your own
inquisition -

00:37:53.326 --> 00:37:53.993 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: I do this, no.

00:37:53.993 --> 00:37:54.660 align:middle line:90%
Through technology -

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.028 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:37:56.028 --> 00:38:02.902 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So the body indicates
that your bladder is disturbed.

00:38:02.902 --> 00:38:08.407 align:middle line:84%
And then I ask the body,
OK, what causes disturbance.

00:38:08.407 --> 00:38:12.578 align:middle line:84%
I ask the body is this
[inaudible] poisoning

00:38:12.578 --> 00:38:16.816 align:middle line:84%
that causes bladder
infection symptom.

00:38:16.816 --> 00:38:21.721 align:middle line:84%
Was it caused by
intestinal [inaudible]?

00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:25.091 align:middle line:84%
Is it caused by [inaudible]
infection, or whatever?

00:38:25.091 --> 00:38:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Is it caused by food poisoning?

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:32.732 align:middle line:84%
I offer the body's, or I said is
it this, is it this, is it this,

00:38:32.732 --> 00:38:36.169 align:middle line:84%
and the body [inaudible]
yes, that's what it is.

00:38:36.169 --> 00:38:41.340 align:middle line:84%
And the body responds to
me with changing, first,

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.410 align:middle line:90%
we had a disturbed state.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.347 align:middle line:84%
We had a chaotic signal, and
once I put the right remedy in,

00:38:48.347 --> 00:38:50.650 align:middle line:84%
the body responds with
a [inaudible] signal.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:51.484 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:38:51.484 --> 00:38:52.785 align:middle line:90%
So this is a matter of putting

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:56.322 align:middle line:84%
into the field the frequency
of, you use homeopathic -

00:38:56.322 --> 00:38:57.323 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: The information -

00:38:57.323 --> 00:38:58.524 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The information,
not frequency.

00:38:58.524 --> 00:39:01.194 align:middle line:84%
Information of homeopathic
remedies, for example,

00:39:01.194 --> 00:39:05.231 align:middle line:84%
which are, is wonderful,
wonderfully subtle and complete.

00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:08.167 align:middle line:84%
So you put that in the field
as you're doing your inquiry.

00:39:08.167 --> 00:39:10.036 align:middle line:84%
Kind of a process,
a logical process.

00:39:10.036 --> 00:39:11.804 align:middle line:90%
Someone who's practicing this.

00:39:11.804 --> 00:39:13.673 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's good
to be medically trained

00:39:13.673 --> 00:39:15.074 align:middle line:84%
and have some knowledge
of the body -

00:39:15.074 --> 00:39:15.908 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes [inaudible] -

00:39:15.908 --> 00:39:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So you put this through.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.579 align:middle line:84%
You go through the process of
watching how the light responds

00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:21.180 align:middle line:84%
until it hits that
coherent state

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.749 align:middle line:84%
when you put the correct
homeopathic remedy in?

00:39:23.749 --> 00:39:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes.

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.384 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:39:25.384 --> 00:39:27.386 align:middle line:84%
Now from there, you've
discovered what it is.

00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:27.920 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.021 align:middle line:90%
Then I, OK.

00:39:29.021 --> 00:39:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Say if it's one of the
intestinal bacteria.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.565 align:middle line:84%
Now, my reasoning, I mean, if
the intestinal bacteria are

00:39:39.565 --> 00:39:43.302 align:middle line:84%
in your bladder, that means
your intestines are disturbed.

00:39:43.302 --> 00:39:47.707 align:middle line:84%
Because the appendicitis or
whatever creates a climate

00:39:47.707 --> 00:39:51.010 align:middle line:84%
in the intestines in which
no intestinal flora can live.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.245 align:middle line:90%
So they move out.

00:39:52.245 --> 00:39:53.613 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:39:53.613 --> 00:39:56.716 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So if I'm, I find the
intestinal bacteria outside the

00:39:56.716 --> 00:39:59.185 align:middle line:84%
intestine, OK, then I know
there's something wrong

00:39:59.185 --> 00:40:03.222 align:middle line:84%
in the intestines, and
it could be appendicitis,

00:40:03.222 --> 00:40:05.925 align:middle line:90%
it could be a whiplash.

00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:08.394 align:middle line:84%
Whiplash cause great
intestinal disturbances -

00:40:08.394 --> 00:40:10.029 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:40:10.029 --> 00:40:13.566 align:middle line:84%
And so you, when once you've
identified what it is ,

00:40:13.566 --> 00:40:16.502 align:middle line:84%
which remedy it is,
then tell us how

00:40:16.502 --> 00:40:18.704 align:middle line:84%
that interfaces with
the human body?

00:40:18.704 --> 00:40:21.407 align:middle line:84%
How the technology
itself is used?

00:40:21.407 --> 00:40:23.809 align:middle line:84%
So people get, I mean,
we saw the machine

00:40:23.809 --> 00:40:25.111 align:middle line:90%
on that little open bit.

00:40:25.111 --> 00:40:26.045 align:middle line:90%
We saw a couple -

00:40:26.045 --> 00:40:27.313 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: We call it
an instrument -

00:40:27.313 --> 00:40:30.249 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Instrument, and we
saw the little glass rods.

00:40:30.249 --> 00:40:33.753 align:middle line:84%
So tell us what you do with
the person at that point.

00:40:33.753 --> 00:40:38.691 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, we can
get information

00:40:38.691 --> 00:40:41.027 align:middle line:90%
of all kind of remedies.

00:40:41.027 --> 00:40:49.468 align:middle line:84%
We can remedy information of
one of the intestinal bacteria.

00:40:49.468 --> 00:40:55.675 align:middle line:84%
And what the remedy is is
the opposite information

00:40:55.675 --> 00:40:57.143 align:middle line:90%
from the bacteria itself -

00:40:57.143 --> 00:40:59.312 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Kind of like [inaudible].

00:40:59.312 --> 00:40:59.879 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:40:59.879 --> 00:41:01.247 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah -

00:41:01.247 --> 00:41:03.049 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yeah, but most homeopaths
have no idea how [inaudible]

00:41:03.049 --> 00:41:03.582 align:middle line:90%
works -

00:41:03.582 --> 00:41:04.350 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:05.318 align:middle line:90%
So you studied that, too -

00:41:05.318 --> 00:41:07.119 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes, we did that, too.

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:14.226 align:middle line:84%
So in the first place,
we have these two rods,

00:41:14.226 --> 00:41:20.433 align:middle line:84%
and the basic therapy
is only light.

00:41:20.433 --> 00:41:25.538 align:middle line:84%
This, whereby one of the
rods absorbs all the body,

00:41:25.538 --> 00:41:29.175 align:middle line:84%
there's a body, all the light
that the body is emitting,

00:41:29.175 --> 00:41:33.579 align:middle line:84%
which consists of
coherent and chaotic light.

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:35.982 align:middle line:90%
Then it goes to the instrument.

00:41:35.982 --> 00:41:40.453 align:middle line:84%
The coherent light is and
chaotic light are split.

00:41:40.453 --> 00:41:43.956 align:middle line:84%
The chaotic light I amplified
and given back to the body -

00:41:43.956 --> 00:41:46.359 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The chaotic light
is then made coherent -

00:41:46.359 --> 00:41:46.859 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No.

00:41:46.859 --> 00:41:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.996 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: The coherent light
is made, is amplified -

00:41:50.996 --> 00:41:51.931 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:41:51.931 --> 00:41:52.765 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And going
back to the body.

00:41:52.765 --> 00:41:55.234 align:middle line:90%
The chaotic light is inverted.

00:41:55.234 --> 00:41:56.969 align:middle line:90%
It makes exactly the opposite -

00:41:56.969 --> 00:41:58.371 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:02.308 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And in its, on its way
back, that's where it cancels

00:42:02.308 --> 00:42:05.745 align:middle line:84%
out the chaotic light
that's in the body.

00:42:05.745 --> 00:42:10.316 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this [inaudible]
with the speed of light.

00:42:10.316 --> 00:42:13.285 align:middle line:84%
Was [inaudible] many
times a second.

00:42:13.285 --> 00:42:17.923 align:middle line:84%
And every cycle takes with it
the changes the previous cycle

00:42:17.923 --> 00:42:19.058 align:middle line:90%
has caused.

00:42:19.058 --> 00:42:21.227 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So how long
would a person do this

00:42:21.227 --> 00:42:23.696 align:middle line:84%
or [inaudible] this
device, instrument -

00:42:23.696 --> 00:42:25.698 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: It's for adults.

00:42:25.698 --> 00:42:27.400 align:middle line:90%
It's different than for kids.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.569 align:middle line:84%
Adults do it normally for
ten minutes, and kids do it

00:42:30.569 --> 00:42:34.006 align:middle line:90%
for two or one minute.

00:42:34.006 --> 00:42:36.575 align:middle line:84%
But this is the [inaudible]
light only.

00:42:36.575 --> 00:42:42.715 align:middle line:84%
This information of the
remedies is modulated on top

00:42:42.715 --> 00:42:49.355 align:middle line:84%
of the body's own light, and
that's when we can, for example,

00:42:49.355 --> 00:42:54.493 align:middle line:84%
we can clean the bacteria
or we can clear or try

00:42:54.493 --> 00:42:57.463 align:middle line:90%
to clean acute appendicitis

00:42:57.463 --> 00:43:01.100 align:middle line:84%
or a chronic appendicitis
or anything else.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.103 align:middle line:84%
What will happen in
ten minutes' time.

00:43:04.103 --> 00:43:07.173 align:middle line:84%
This treatment keeps
working for three days.

00:43:07.173 --> 00:43:13.212 align:middle line:84%
That's why we [inaudible] you
can have maximum one treatment

00:43:13.212 --> 00:43:14.613 align:middle line:90%
every at five days.

00:43:14.613 --> 00:43:16.649 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Because it continues on.

00:43:16.649 --> 00:43:17.483 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:43:17.483 --> 00:43:21.287 align:middle line:90%
It continues on for three days,

00:43:21.287 --> 00:43:25.958 align:middle line:84%
and then we give the body one
day rest or a little more,

00:43:25.958 --> 00:43:31.831 align:middle line:84%
and then we do it again because
you can't overburden the body.

00:43:31.831 --> 00:43:35.034 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: One of the doctors you
work with out of Oslo, I mean,

00:43:35.034 --> 00:43:38.504 align:middle line:84%
it took some time, I would
assume, because I wrote here.

00:43:38.504 --> 00:43:41.140 align:middle line:84%
It's usually the oddballs
that change the world.

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.809 align:middle line:84%
That's a famous saying
having to do

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:45.344 align:middle line:84%
with all the breakthrough
technologies

00:43:45.344 --> 00:43:46.779 align:middle line:84%
and discoveries throughout
history.

00:43:46.779 --> 00:43:48.180 align:middle line:90%
It's always the oddballs,

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.282 align:middle line:84%
and someone like yourself
who's gone off the path

00:43:50.282 --> 00:43:51.817 align:middle line:90%
and continued asking questions

00:43:51.817 --> 00:43:54.787 align:middle line:84%
when everyone else thought you
better give it up, you know,

00:43:54.787 --> 00:43:57.022 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, turn
to a real career.

00:43:57.022 --> 00:43:59.725 align:middle line:84%
So now, science has
started taking this up.

00:43:59.725 --> 00:44:01.760 align:middle line:84%
It's, you have been
affiliated with,

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.995 align:middle line:84%
is it the University
of [inaudible] -

00:44:02.995 --> 00:44:04.330 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah -

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.634 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: [Inaudible], and then
also this doctor in Norway.

00:44:08.634 --> 00:44:12.738 align:middle line:84%
He was finding, he had a lot
of seasonal mood disorder

00:44:12.738 --> 00:44:13.939 align:middle line:90%
from the lack of light.

00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:17.276 align:middle line:84%
Lot of infections in
people, and he was finding,

00:44:17.276 --> 00:44:19.245 align:middle line:84%
why don't you tell us what
happened with his work?

00:44:19.245 --> 00:44:20.779 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: I don't know.

00:44:20.779 --> 00:44:22.381 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, it's an
article I read on it.

00:44:22.381 --> 00:44:24.683 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, he was
using your technology -

00:44:24.683 --> 00:44:25.451 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Oh, yeah, he does.

00:44:25.451 --> 00:44:26.485 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:44:26.485 --> 00:44:27.887 align:middle line:84%
He's using your technology
and finding

00:44:27.887 --> 00:44:33.325 align:middle line:84%
that not only did he not have to
prescribed antibiotics as much,

00:44:33.325 --> 00:44:36.695 align:middle line:84%
but if he did have to
prescribe them, for a shorter,

00:44:36.695 --> 00:44:39.965 align:middle line:84%
a shorter course, but oftentimes
didn't have to prescribe any

00:44:39.965 --> 00:44:42.701 align:middle line:84%
to people because this
technology would just wipe

00:44:42.701 --> 00:44:44.970 align:middle line:84%
out whatever the base
infection caused -

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:45.738 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah, it does.

00:44:45.738 --> 00:44:46.305 align:middle line:90%
It does -

00:44:46.305 --> 00:44:46.872 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah -

00:44:46.872 --> 00:44:48.140 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: So, and -

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:48.774 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so he was a convert,
but there are a lot of -

00:44:48.774 --> 00:44:49.808 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Oh, yeah -

00:44:49.808 --> 00:44:50.609 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Offices all
over the world now.

00:44:50.609 --> 00:44:52.011 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:44:52.011 --> 00:44:56.815 align:middle line:84%
We have, and, but, I mean, even,
I have come to the conclusion

00:44:56.815 --> 00:44:58.417 align:middle line:90%
that I always thought

00:44:58.417 --> 00:45:02.221 align:middle line:84%
that antibiotics
[inaudible] they worked.

00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:03.556 align:middle line:90%
I think they stopped working

00:45:03.556 --> 00:45:06.926 align:middle line:84%
because of bacteria
getting resistant -

00:45:06.926 --> 00:45:07.993 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:07.993 --> 00:45:12.164 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: But I learned
that it never works.

00:45:12.164 --> 00:45:13.232 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Really.

00:45:13.232 --> 00:45:16.602 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Because it seems
that the bacteria,

00:45:16.602 --> 00:45:21.373 align:middle line:84%
the top layer is killed, but
the rest of bacteria withdraws

00:45:21.373 --> 00:45:24.310 align:middle line:90%
into tissues, and they -

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:25.844 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It re-emerges
at some point -

00:45:25.844 --> 00:45:26.946 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: It re-emerges.

00:45:26.946 --> 00:45:33.085 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even because
if I, somebody who was,

00:45:33.085 --> 00:45:38.257 align:middle line:84%
when she was two, she got
penicillin for all the,

00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:44.496 align:middle line:84%
for the infections then that
she had, and forty years later,

00:45:44.496 --> 00:45:51.303 align:middle line:84%
I found, I give the body
the opposite of penicillin.

00:45:51.303 --> 00:45:53.339 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What would the
opposite of penicillin be?

00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:54.340 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Well, I mean,

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.574 align:middle line:84%
the penicillin has
information, too -

00:45:55.574 --> 00:45:56.976 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:56.976 --> 00:46:00.813 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And if you influence it,
and you give that to the body,

00:46:00.813 --> 00:46:03.182 align:middle line:84%
then the body gets
[inaudible] penicillin.

00:46:03.182 --> 00:46:06.018 align:middle line:90%
But then immediately all

00:46:06.018 --> 00:46:09.555 align:middle line:84%
of those symptoms come
back within a day.

00:46:09.555 --> 00:46:13.692 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, hey, what's this?

00:46:13.692 --> 00:46:18.831 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know, but, I
mean, it was very clear

00:46:18.831 --> 00:46:23.302 align:middle line:84%
that the penicillin had
never killed anything.

00:46:23.302 --> 00:46:25.004 align:middle line:90%
[inaudible]

00:46:25.004 --> 00:46:29.742 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So the goal is
to restore the body

00:46:29.742 --> 00:46:36.315 align:middle line:84%
to its original clean
functioning operating system

00:46:36.315 --> 00:46:37.516 align:middle line:90%
with this.

00:46:37.516 --> 00:46:38.584 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:46:38.584 --> 00:46:41.120 align:middle line:84%
To restore all the
function in the body.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:47.359 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, the body can
do everything itself again.

00:46:47.359 --> 00:46:52.264 align:middle line:84%
But one of the important
things is

00:46:52.264 --> 00:46:56.535 align:middle line:84%
that the immune system
needs to be trained again.

00:46:56.535 --> 00:46:58.537 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So how does
that process begin?

00:46:58.537 --> 00:47:03.175 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, if you, you
might get food poisoning, right.

00:47:03.175 --> 00:47:07.046 align:middle line:84%
And the food poisoning
always results

00:47:07.046 --> 00:47:13.552 align:middle line:90%
in the symptoms of a cold.

00:47:13.552 --> 00:47:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, [inaudible] then you must
assume it's food poisoning.

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:19.491 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Really.

00:47:19.491 --> 00:47:21.360 align:middle line:84%
If you have a cold, you
must assume it's something

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.594 align:middle line:90%
[inaudible] -

00:47:22.594 --> 00:47:26.365 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yes, and because the
food poisoning bacteria,

00:47:26.365 --> 00:47:29.101 align:middle line:90%
they infect all mucus membranes.

00:47:29.101 --> 00:47:33.238 align:middle line:84%
The sinuses, the throat,
or anything like that.

00:47:33.238 --> 00:47:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, the body will
deal with that,

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:43.649 align:middle line:84%
and they might get a
cold, and can wait.

00:47:43.649 --> 00:47:48.187 align:middle line:84%
You might wait ten
days, and it's gone.

00:47:48.187 --> 00:47:53.392 align:middle line:84%
A second time, the, you
get a cold, it will be gone

00:47:53.392 --> 00:47:59.231 align:middle line:84%
in two days, and then
you don't get it anymore.

00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:03.502 align:middle line:84%
I mean, because it's an
allergy is an overreaction

00:48:03.502 --> 00:48:06.171 align:middle line:84%
of an already irritated
mucus membrane.

00:48:06.171 --> 00:48:09.041 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There's a lot of
thought that the things we eat,

00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:11.477 align:middle line:84%
the refined things we eat,
sugar and refined carbohydrates

00:48:11.477 --> 00:48:13.779 align:middle line:84%
and such cause an
environment that allow

00:48:13.779 --> 00:48:15.214 align:middle line:90%
for the bacteria to flourish.

00:48:15.214 --> 00:48:18.584 align:middle line:84%
So how does what you
do interface with that?

00:48:18.584 --> 00:48:20.719 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: If the body is
in the right condition,

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:24.289 align:middle line:84%
the body uses everything
in a totally different way.

00:48:24.289 --> 00:48:26.492 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, in other words,
if your body is already clean

00:48:26.492 --> 00:48:28.927 align:middle line:84%
and clear and functioning
well, you can eat whatever?

00:48:28.927 --> 00:48:30.763 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: If you [inaudible]
function, -

00:48:30.763 --> 00:48:31.330 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:31.864 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Works.

00:48:31.864 --> 00:48:33.632 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:33.632 --> 00:48:39.905 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Then all that
you get in is separated

00:48:39.905 --> 00:48:45.043 align:middle line:84%
between what a body can use
and what should be excreted.

00:48:45.043 --> 00:48:46.945 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And we're not
doing that anymore -

00:48:46.945 --> 00:48:48.947 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: We're not
doing it at all -

00:48:48.947 --> 00:48:49.748 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So -

00:48:49.748 --> 00:48:51.550 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: [Inaudible] anything.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:57.089 align:middle line:84%
I mean, and even if you
were have junk food -

00:48:57.089 --> 00:48:58.490 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:03.762 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Now if you have, if
your body works properly,

00:49:03.762 --> 00:49:05.531 align:middle line:84%
then the body will
reject junk food.

00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:06.965 align:middle line:90%
It automatically.

00:49:06.965 --> 00:49:11.003 align:middle line:84%
It cannot use it or
cannot use everything.

00:49:11.003 --> 00:49:12.137 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it just
passes on through.

00:49:12.137 --> 00:49:12.871 align:middle line:90%
No real -

00:49:12.871 --> 00:49:13.405 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes.

00:49:13.405 --> 00:49:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:16.809 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: It doesn't, but it
doesn't know what to do with it.

00:49:16.809 --> 00:49:17.776 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It tolerates it,

00:49:17.776 --> 00:49:18.577 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't know
what to do with it -

00:49:18.577 --> 00:49:19.144 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:49:19.144 --> 00:49:20.379 align:middle line:90%
So it stores it.

00:49:20.379 --> 00:49:21.713 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:49:21.713 --> 00:49:23.982 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: The trick is to get
the body discrimination system

00:49:23.982 --> 00:49:24.516 align:middle line:90%
right -

00:49:24.516 --> 00:49:25.717 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:49:25.717 --> 00:49:28.387 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So it will process
everything right again,

00:49:28.387 --> 00:49:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and then starts detoxifying the
body and the small intestine,

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:35.160 align:middle line:84%
the stomach, the
large intestine.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.764 align:middle line:84%
Because every system in the
body has to work for properly -

00:49:38.764 --> 00:49:39.865 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:49:39.865 --> 00:49:44.937 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And if you have
restored everything,

00:49:44.937 --> 00:49:49.708 align:middle line:90%
then the body needs time.

00:49:49.708 --> 00:49:52.277 align:middle line:84%
And then it will
slowly get up to speed.

00:49:52.277 --> 00:49:59.251 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people they get
incredible positive reactions

00:49:59.251 --> 00:50:00.452 align:middle line:90%
almost immediately.

00:50:00.452 --> 00:50:05.891 align:middle line:84%
The ones [inaudible] the
system has been restored,

00:50:05.891 --> 00:50:12.931 align:middle line:84%
and there are also people that,
where that react opposite way

00:50:12.931 --> 00:50:17.135 align:middle line:84%
to all kind of different
thing, or they don't react,

00:50:17.135 --> 00:50:23.709 align:middle line:84%
and most time those people are
in what I call a spin inversion.

00:50:23.709 --> 00:50:24.743 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: A spinning inversion -

00:50:24.743 --> 00:50:25.811 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: A spinning inversion -

00:50:25.811 --> 00:50:27.112 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, a spinning
inversion, yeah -

00:50:27.112 --> 00:50:28.247 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Then the electrons
turn the wrong way around -

00:50:28.247 --> 00:50:29.514 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, yeah -

00:50:29.514 --> 00:50:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And then the body
starts working against itself.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:32.518 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:50:32.518 --> 00:50:34.353 align:middle line:84%
Is that what autoimmune
is, more or less?

00:50:34.353 --> 00:50:35.587 align:middle line:90%
A -

00:50:35.587 --> 00:50:36.955 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, I think
[inaudible] aggressive cancers -

00:50:36.955 --> 00:50:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:40.459 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And leukemia is
always spinning inversion -

00:50:40.459 --> 00:50:41.560 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK -

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.061 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And those are
things we can easily -

00:50:43.061 --> 00:50:44.529 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So you can
easily reverse.

00:50:44.529 --> 00:50:46.765 align:middle line:84%
OK. Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:50:46.765 --> 00:50:49.768 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we still have
a little bit of time left,

00:50:49.768 --> 00:50:51.870 align:middle line:90%
maybe five, six minutes left.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:54.473 align:middle line:84%
What does it not work
on besides structural?

00:50:54.473 --> 00:50:57.776 align:middle line:84%
We already said functional,
yes, structural, no.

00:50:57.776 --> 00:50:58.844 align:middle line:90%
Is there anything else you found

00:50:58.844 --> 00:51:01.980 align:middle line:84%
that it just doesn't
have any impact on?

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:06.184 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Now, we have to
be careful with anybody

00:51:06.184 --> 00:51:08.353 align:middle line:90%
who has organ transplants.

00:51:08.353 --> 00:51:17.429 align:middle line:84%
We can't really treat them
because one of the things is,

00:51:18.697 --> 00:51:21.900 align:middle line:84%
was it necessary, is to
restore discrimination system

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:22.668 align:middle line:90%
in the party.

00:51:22.668 --> 00:51:23.368 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That's hard.

00:51:23.368 --> 00:51:24.503 align:middle line:90%
It's not your part, huh.

00:51:24.503 --> 00:51:25.904 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: And [inaudible].

00:51:25.904 --> 00:51:26.805 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:51:26.805 --> 00:51:27.873 align:middle line:90%
It's not recognizing it.

00:51:27.873 --> 00:51:28.807 align:middle line:90%
It's not yours.

00:51:28.807 --> 00:51:30.642 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So it, once
it recognize it,

00:51:30.642 --> 00:51:32.377 align:middle line:84%
it's immediately just
we don't want it -

00:51:32.377 --> 00:51:33.345 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: We don't want it, yup.

00:51:33.345 --> 00:51:35.847 align:middle line:90%
OK. So rejection.

00:51:35.847 --> 00:51:38.383 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: So we also
have to be careful

00:51:38.383 --> 00:51:42.754 align:middle line:90%
with people who have bypass -

00:51:42.754 --> 00:51:43.689 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:51:43.689 --> 00:51:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And there
is no [inaudible]

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:49.061 align:middle line:90%
with the body's own veins.

00:51:49.061 --> 00:51:50.295 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] veins we can treat,

00:51:50.295 --> 00:51:51.863 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes it's
done by pressing.

00:51:51.863 --> 00:51:52.965 align:middle line:90%
We can't do that.

00:51:52.965 --> 00:51:53.865 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's done by what?

00:51:53.865 --> 00:51:54.633 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: By plastic -

00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Plastic.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.102 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes. Artificial veins -

00:51:57.102 --> 00:52:02.674 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: We, and they, if the
tube disconnects from the artery

00:52:02.674 --> 00:52:08.213 align:middle line:90%
or whatever, you can't do that.

00:52:08.213 --> 00:52:09.014 align:middle line:90%
And -

00:52:09.014 --> 00:52:10.248 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So that makes sense.

00:52:10.248 --> 00:52:13.218 align:middle line:84%
It's, it will reject what's
not natively its own -

00:52:13.218 --> 00:52:18.857 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, everything
isn't, everything is the,

00:52:18.857 --> 00:52:23.095 align:middle line:84%
everything that's not the
body's own is a poison.

00:52:23.095 --> 00:52:24.463 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:52:24.463 --> 00:52:28.233 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Everything that's not
the body's own, even this water

00:52:28.233 --> 00:52:34.206 align:middle line:84%
that I drink is a poison, and
it's [inaudible] is a poison.

00:52:34.206 --> 00:52:35.674 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible] is a poison.

00:52:35.674 --> 00:52:37.809 align:middle line:90%
It's because not the body's own.

00:52:37.809 --> 00:52:42.214 align:middle line:84%
Now the body has a digestive
system to make it [inaudible].

00:52:42.214 --> 00:52:44.316 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: To break it down and go

00:52:44.316 --> 00:52:45.717 align:middle line:84%
through the process
to recognize -

00:52:45.717 --> 00:52:47.085 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:47.085 --> 00:52:50.622 align:middle line:84%
And that transforms it, and
is a part of it is excreted -

00:52:50.622 --> 00:52:51.456 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:52:51.456 --> 00:52:54.226 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: But even allergy testing.

00:52:54.226 --> 00:52:57.629 align:middle line:84%
What they test is
something totally different

00:52:57.629 --> 00:52:59.064 align:middle line:90%
than what is in the body.

00:52:59.064 --> 00:53:03.735 align:middle line:84%
Because the body, the
saliva, the stomach is,

00:53:03.735 --> 00:53:06.204 align:middle line:90%
it's all [inaudible] already.

00:53:06.204 --> 00:53:09.007 align:middle line:90%
So you can't do allergy testing.

00:53:09.007 --> 00:53:10.042 align:middle line:90%
It's bullshit.

00:53:10.042 --> 00:53:10.675 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:53:10.675 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:90%
OK. So it's BS.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.146 align:middle line:90%
OK. Allergy testing is BS.

00:53:14.146 --> 00:53:16.114 align:middle line:90%
OK. What about light itself?

00:53:16.114 --> 00:53:18.683 align:middle line:84%
We can't talk about this
without talking about the sun,

00:53:18.683 --> 00:53:21.119 align:middle line:84%
which I brought up earlier,
and the information coming

00:53:21.119 --> 00:53:23.188 align:middle line:84%
from the sun, and you're
really big on get rid

00:53:23.188 --> 00:53:27.125 align:middle line:84%
of the sunglasses, get rid of
the sunblock and allow the sun -

00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:33.498 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yeah, but we, since
the light of the sun is

00:53:33.498 --> 00:53:35.634 align:middle line:90%
so many times more intense -

00:53:35.634 --> 00:53:36.968 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:53:36.968 --> 00:53:39.271 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Than it used to be
twenty, thirty years ago, we,

00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:41.473 align:middle line:84%
everything needs to
be in moderation.

00:53:41.473 --> 00:53:44.142 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sun worshippers,
you can't do that anymore.

00:53:44.142 --> 00:53:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.645 align:middle line:84%
You can't lay out at noon
for three or four hours -

00:53:46.645 --> 00:53:47.946 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Right.

00:53:47.946 --> 00:53:51.349 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I myself, I mean,
I also build it up slowly -

00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:53.819 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: I mean, ten minutes -

00:53:53.819 --> 00:53:54.386 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Ten minutes -

00:53:54.386 --> 00:53:56.154 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes, and.

00:53:56.154 --> 00:53:57.756 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Taking a walk
in the early morning

00:53:57.756 --> 00:53:58.857 align:middle line:90%
when the light is still -

00:53:58.857 --> 00:54:00.292 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Yeah, when
the light is, yeah,

00:54:00.292 --> 00:54:02.260 align:middle line:90%
early morning or late after -

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:05.097 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But it's important that
we have it through our eyes.

00:54:05.097 --> 00:54:06.264 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:54:06.264 --> 00:54:11.069 align:middle line:84%
That's [inaudible] doctor
M.D. They discovered

00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:18.076 align:middle line:84%
that the increase in
cancer came at the same time

00:54:18.076 --> 00:54:19.578 align:middle line:84%
with the invention
of sunglasses.

00:54:19.578 --> 00:54:21.146 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Of course.

00:54:21.146 --> 00:54:22.214 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:54:22.214 --> 00:54:23.715 align:middle line:90%
OK, and enough said on that.

00:54:23.715 --> 00:54:27.085 align:middle line:84%
OK. Now we have a couple of
minutes left, and what I wanted

00:54:27.085 --> 00:54:29.788 align:middle line:84%
to bring up was, I was
excited about when I read

00:54:29.788 --> 00:54:31.189 align:middle line:90%
about what you are doing now

00:54:31.189 --> 00:54:32.824 align:middle line:84%
because you're now
many generations, six,

00:54:32.824 --> 00:54:35.660 align:middle line:84%
seven generations in
from the technology

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.096 align:middle line:84%
that helped our friend
here recover

00:54:38.096 --> 00:54:40.732 align:middle line:84%
from all those infections
back in the mid-80's,

00:54:40.732 --> 00:54:43.468 align:middle line:84%
but you have also
started a device

00:54:43.468 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:84%
that is a tiny little
thing about this big.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.207 align:middle line:84%
You've created that, that people
can use by themselves at home.

00:54:49.207 --> 00:54:50.775 align:middle line:84%
I mean, once they know
what the problem is,

00:54:50.775 --> 00:54:53.445 align:middle line:84%
if you have food poisoning
or whatnot, you have chips

00:54:53.445 --> 00:54:56.581 align:middle line:84%
that go in, and give that
homeopathic information,

00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:59.084 align:middle line:84%
and it works very
similarly to the big unit -

00:54:59.084 --> 00:55:00.318 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:55:00.318 --> 00:55:02.988 align:middle line:84%
It works very much similar,
but it's a home device.

00:55:02.988 --> 00:55:06.992 align:middle line:84%
If you have regular food
poisonings or something

00:55:06.992 --> 00:55:08.126 align:middle line:90%
like that, you can put a chip

00:55:08.126 --> 00:55:09.728 align:middle line:84%
in for food poisoning,
and you can -

00:55:09.728 --> 00:55:11.530 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What about, like,
sleep disturbance -

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:12.831 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Sleep disturbance,
you can -

00:55:12.831 --> 00:55:15.233 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you have about
500 different remedies of -

00:55:15.233 --> 00:55:18.203 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: Well, yeah, but we have
a number of standard cards -

00:55:18.203 --> 00:55:19.504 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes -

00:55:19.504 --> 00:55:22.774 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And, for to restore
your whole hormonal system,

00:55:22.774 --> 00:55:23.675 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:55:23.675 --> 00:55:25.043 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, yes.

00:55:25.043 --> 00:55:26.344 align:middle line:90%
That sounds, and the appendix,

00:55:26.344 --> 00:55:27.979 align:middle line:84%
sounds like everybody
needs that pretty much -

00:55:27.979 --> 00:55:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yeah.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.684 align:middle line:84%
And there's a basic
program for whiplash -

00:55:32.684 --> 00:55:33.685 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:55:33.685 --> 00:55:34.953 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: You don't
need a card for that.

00:55:34.953 --> 00:55:38.823 align:middle line:84%
You just need to have the
rods put in your neck -

00:55:38.823 --> 00:55:40.158 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, interesting -

00:55:40.158 --> 00:55:42.294 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: And that takes two
minutes, and whiplash is gone.

00:55:42.294 --> 00:55:43.695 align:middle line:90%
So -

00:55:43.695 --> 00:55:47.265 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So this is really where
it's coming down to the people

00:55:47.265 --> 00:55:50.368 align:middle line:84%
because not, even though you
have, what, five, five, 500,

00:55:50.368 --> 00:55:53.805 align:middle line:84%
600 different offices around the
world, another 140 in the US,

00:55:53.805 --> 00:55:55.473 align:middle line:90%
not everybody can get to -

00:55:55.473 --> 00:55:56.141 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: No, no.

00:55:56.141 --> 00:55:56.775 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's why -

00:55:56.775 --> 00:55:57.709 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: An office.

00:55:57.709 --> 00:55:59.311 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's why
you created it -

00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:00.478 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: We created it.

00:56:00.478 --> 00:56:01.479 align:middle line:90%
I mean, -

00:56:01.479 --> 00:56:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well -

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.682 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: And we also wanted

00:56:03.682 --> 00:56:07.018 align:middle line:84%
to have far more
[inaudible] far more insight

00:56:07.018 --> 00:56:09.387 align:middle line:90%
to what their own light can do -

00:56:09.387 --> 00:56:10.222 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:56:10.222 --> 00:56:12.257 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: And there [inaudible].

00:56:12.257 --> 00:56:20.732 align:middle line:84%
I mean, any practitioner,
I mean, if he is,

00:56:20.732 --> 00:56:24.236 align:middle line:84%
he or she is fully booked,
he or she can do maximum

00:56:24.236 --> 00:56:26.037 align:middle line:90%
of 300 people a year -

00:56:26.037 --> 00:56:27.172 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:56:27.172 --> 00:56:29.274 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be able to
take this on ourselves.

00:56:29.274 --> 00:56:30.375 align:middle line:90%
So -

00:56:30.375 --> 00:56:31.943 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: We need to take
it onto ourselves -

00:56:31.943 --> 00:56:35.146 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, I thank you on
behalf of everybody who's going

00:56:35.146 --> 00:56:36.381 align:middle line:84%
to be able to take
advantage of this

00:56:36.381 --> 00:56:38.149 align:middle line:90%
because it's really brand new -

00:56:38.149 --> 00:56:39.451 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes -

00:56:39.451 --> 00:56:40.585 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So just coming out in
the last couple of months,

00:56:40.585 --> 00:56:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's about, what, a
thousand dollars and -

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.588 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes -

00:56:43.588 --> 00:56:45.090 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And $25 for the
different programs and chips.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.092 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
who have offices

00:56:47.092 --> 00:56:49.661 align:middle line:84%
or small practices could even
use this small one it sounds

00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:52.464 align:middle line:84%
like to an extent, even though
you can't do the diagnosis -

00:56:52.464 --> 00:56:53.798 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: We have quite
a few chiropractors -

00:56:53.798 --> 00:56:54.833 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, there you go -

00:56:54.833 --> 00:56:55.834 align:middle line:84%
>> JB: I mean, we
use it for whiplash.

00:56:55.834 --> 00:56:57.502 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No, that's amazing.

00:56:57.502 --> 00:56:59.938 align:middle line:84%
Well, Johan, I want
to thank you so much

00:56:59.938 --> 00:57:03.375 align:middle line:84%
for all the work you've
done, and, I mean, to me,

00:57:03.375 --> 00:57:04.909 align:middle line:84%
nothing makes more
sense in the world

00:57:04.909 --> 00:57:06.578 align:middle line:84%
than using our own
light to heal.

00:57:06.578 --> 00:57:07.078 align:middle line:90%
>> JB: Yes.

00:57:07.078 --> 00:57:08.380 align:middle line:90%
It is -

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.848 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And now we can do it
with these little devices.

00:57:09.848 --> 00:57:11.116 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:57:11.116 --> 00:57:13.652 align:middle line:84%
You've done a service
for humanity.

00:57:13.652 --> 00:57:15.553 align:middle line:84%
If you resonate with
healing with light

00:57:15.553 --> 00:57:18.023 align:middle line:84%
and subtle frequencies, you can
learn more about Johan's list

00:57:18.023 --> 00:57:20.692 align:middle line:84%
of practitioners and his
personal device by going

00:57:20.692 --> 00:57:22.727 align:middle line:90%
to [inaudible] dot com.

00:57:22.727 --> 00:57:25.463 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
