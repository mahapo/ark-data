to be essential to life
itself and human health,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.350 align:middle line:10%
iodine is the most misunderstood
and the most feared.

Yet medical professionals
and the public

>> Bernard Courtois,
a French chemist,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:10%
discovered iodine in 1811.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And in the 1920s, it
made its medical debut

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:90%
treating syphilis.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:10%
In fact, iodine has been
used for hundreds of years

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:10%
to treat infections,
Graves' disease, and goiter.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.570 align:middle line:84%
In the early 20th
century, iodized salt

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
was introduced into
the household diet.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.300 align:middle line:84%
An iodine deficiency was
considered a thing of the past.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.560 align:middle line:90%
But is this really the case?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Over the last 40 years,
the rising incidents

Not only is iodine
necessary to sustain life,

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:84%
but it may be the answer
for the growing epidemic

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:90%
of chronic illnesses worldwide.

Tell us, what is iodine?

00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID BROWNSTEIN: Well,
iodine's an essential element.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.860 align:middle line:10%
And as you started
your introduction

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:10%
by saying it's the most
misunderstood nutrient, which

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.760 align:middle line:10%
it is, it's an essential
element we can't live without.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.130 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD: Why is it so
important for people's health?

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.880 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
every cell in the body

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:10%
needs and requires
iodine to survive.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:10%
So if we don't have enough
iodine, we will literally die.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Where
do we find iodine?

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
iodine is found in salt,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.610 align:middle line:84%
refined salt. It's found in
seafood and ocean products.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
But it's been in drastic
decline in our diets

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:90%
over the last 40 to 50 years.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So dating back in
history, what has iodine been

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:90%
used for, especially medically?

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, in
the early 19th century,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
iodine was the most
used item in medicine.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was primarily
used for infections,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.990 align:middle line:84%
which was the number
one killer at the time.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
In the 20th century, iodine
was used for thyroid problems

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:90%
and goiter.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was widely
used in medicine

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.160 align:middle line:84%
until iodized salt became
in vogue in the mid-1920s.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Once iodine was added to salt,
the medical professionals

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.893 align:middle line:84%
lost interest in
iodine, and everyone

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:17.060 align:middle line:84%
was told the myth that
there's enough iodine in salt

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:90%
they don't need anymore.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, so why
is it that doctors think

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.830 align:middle line:90%
that we don't need iodine?

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.455 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that people think that
we're not deficient in iodine?

00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:26.663 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, number
one, doctors aren't taught

00:03:26.663 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:90%
about iodine in medical school.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're basically taught that
there's enough iodine in salt

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
and the iodine deficiency
epidemic that was occurring

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
in the early 20th century was
resolved from iodized salt,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.890 align:middle line:90%
which it wasn't.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what's changed
in the last hundred years

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:90%
in the iodine story?

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: What's changed
is that our iodine levels have

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.780 align:middle line:84%
been falling across the United
States over the last 50 years,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:84%
and they're down about
50% from where they were.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, our exposure

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:84%
to toxic halides that inhibit
iodine use in the body

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.110 align:middle line:90%
have gone up.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of a double
whammy on the body.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
We've had these toxic halides
lowering our iodine levels,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting lower
iodine from our food sources.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you're
saying that you

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.265 align:middle line:84%
can't get sufficient iodine in
salt. What happened with that?

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, in the
early 20th century when iodine

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.506 align:middle line:84%
was added to salt, it did
cure the goiter epidemic,

00:04:20.506 --> 00:04:21.839 align:middle line:90%
and it was successful with that.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It was considered one of the
first public health miracles.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.513 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't enough iodine
for the rest of the body.

00:04:27.513 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of
the body has needs

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:84%
for iodine, especially
the glandular tissue,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
which includes the thyroid,
the ovaries, the uterus,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.190 align:middle line:84%
the breasts, the prostate,
and the pancreas.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And then when you couple it
with the growing toxicity

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
of fluoride and bromide that we
have this increasing exposure

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.728 align:middle line:84%
to, it's made this iodine
deficiency epidemic worse.

00:04:46.728 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Can you talk to
people about the goiter belt?

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
What is the goiter belt, and
has that changed over the years?

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So in
the early 20th century,

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.930 align:middle line:84%
there was an epidemic of goiter
in the midwestern United States

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.790 align:middle line:90%
around the Great Lakes--

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.890 align:middle line:84%
Michigan, Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And then if you
draw a line straight

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.340 align:middle line:84%
down the center of
the country, they

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.080 align:middle line:90%
were suffering from it, too.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't only people that
were suffering from goiter.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:84%
It was animals suffering from
thyroid problems and goiter.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And the animals weren't
growing to the right size.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:84%
And there was a worry that as
the human population expanded,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.660 align:middle line:84%
that we wouldn't be
able to feed them,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.270 align:middle line:84%
that the animal population
wouldn't sustain them.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
So the government mandated
that iodine studies

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
be done in animals to see what's
the smallest amount of iodine

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
you could put in
the feed of animals

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to prevent the thyroid and
goiter problems and procreation

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.290 align:middle line:84%
problems the
animals were having.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And this was done
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:84%
And from those
studies, they estimated

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
how much iodine
humans would need

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.100 align:middle line:90%
to prevent the same problems.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
put iodine in salt,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and they gave it to groups of
people in Ohio and Michigan

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and studied them and found
that their goiter problems went

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.640 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.015 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
the government

00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:00.570 align:middle line:84%
mandated that iodine
be put in salt.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And it was a successful public
health campaign to cure goiter.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, it
wasn't enough to give--

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
enough iodine for
the rest of the body.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what have you
noticed over the years as far

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:84%
as the toxic halogens
like bromide, fluoride--

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
where is that-- is iodine
being removed and being

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.962 align:middle line:84%
replaced with some of
these toxic halogens?

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:23.462 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So if we think
about the periodic table, which

00:06:23.462 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:84%
we all learned in
high school, there

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:90%
was a group called the halogens.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.640 align:middle line:84%
The halogens consist of
fluoride, bromide, iodine,

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:90%
and chloride.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Two of those halogens
are essential.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.690 align:middle line:90%
We can't live without them.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:90%
That's iodine and chloride.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.745 align:middle line:10%
And two are toxic
and non-essential.

00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:84%
We don't need them, and we
shouldn't be exposed to them--

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:90%
fluoride and bromide.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So the problem we've had
over the last 50 years

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.840 align:middle line:84%
is that our exposure to
the toxic halogens fluoride

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and bromide have gone way
up, particularly bromide.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:90%
Bromide is found in food.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It's found in soft drinks.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
It's used as a fire retardant
in many consumer products.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We're probably sitting
on bromide right

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:90%
now in this couch.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride, as we all know, has
been added to the water supply.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride is also found in
many pharmaceutical products

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:84%
as a part of their
chemical makeup.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And as well as
bromide is found in

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.060 align:middle line:90%
many pharmaceutical products.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:84%
So as our iodine levels have
been falling over the last 50

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
years, according to the
government's own National

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:84%
we've had this increasing
exposure to the toxic halides.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's caused our body to
lose more iodine because it's

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.960 align:middle line:84%
called competitive
inhibition, where

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
if you get too much
of one toxic halide,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.568 align:middle line:84%
it'll cause the essential
halide to leave the body.

00:07:33.568 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So most
people are probably

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.450 align:middle line:84%
consuming a lot
of fluoride, a lot

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.890 align:middle line:84%
of brominated toxic
compounds on a daily basis

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.360 align:middle line:84%
in high, high levels and
don't even realize it.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.370 align:middle line:84%
What about finding
iodine in the soil?

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is that a
good source of iodine?

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.410 align:middle line:84%
Where can people
find iodine in foods?

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So you can
really find iodine in seafoods.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It's not very high in the soil
from over farming and pesticide

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.870 align:middle line:90%
use, but in seafood.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.902 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
reasons our iodine levels

00:08:03.902 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
have dropped over the
years, because our soil's

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.187 align:middle line:90%
become so deficient of it.

00:08:07.187 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with
seafood is if you

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.950 align:middle line:84%
don't ingest that seafood within
a short time period of removing

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.140 align:middle line:84%
it from the sea, the
iodine sublimates off

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.982 align:middle line:84%
into a gaseous phase
and leaves the product.

00:08:16.982 --> 00:08:18.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Big situation
that we're dealing with

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.660 align:middle line:90%
in today's society--

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:90%
infertility, pregnancy.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.580 align:middle line:84%
How important is iodine before
pregnancy, during pregnancy,

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:90%
and after pregnancy?

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, iodine
has been studied in pregnancy

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:90%
for over a hundred years now.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.820 align:middle line:10%
It is well known that
if pregnant moms are

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.570 align:middle line:10%
deficient in iodine, that they
can have intelligence quotient

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.760 align:middle line:10%
problems, IQ problems
in their babies.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.760 align:middle line:10%
And they can have attention
problems and a whole host

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.160 align:middle line:10%
of endocrine problems
from thyroid problems

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:10%
to breast problems
to ovarian problems.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's crucial for
moms to be iodine sufficient

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:90%
before they get pregnant.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.833 align:middle line:84%
It's crucial for moms to take
iodine while they're pregnant.

00:08:57.833 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's crucial for
moms to take iodine

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:90%
after they're pregnant.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Studies have clearly shown that
women who are iodine deficient

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
have lower IQ babies compared
to women who have enough iodine.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Now we're dealing
with an epidemic of ADD, ADHD.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And you've done
research on the benefits

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
of taking iodine or utilizing
iodine for children, not

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.170 align:middle line:84%
only for ADHD, not only for ADD,
but also for mental stability,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:90%
brain growth, et cetera.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
What do you see
in today's society

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.153 align:middle line:84%
with children and
iodine deficiency?

00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
studies have clearly

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.850 align:middle line:84%
shown in different
Western countries

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
that women who are
deficient in iodine

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.960 align:middle line:84%
have significantly
higher risk of having

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:90%
ADHD babies and older kids.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So their neurologic
system won't form normally

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:84%
if they don't have
enough iodine.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, this needs to be
taken care of before women

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.642 align:middle line:90%
become pregnant.

00:09:53.642 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, from the
government's own studies,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.360 align:middle line:84%
again, referring to that
NHANES study, nearly 60%

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
of US women of pregnancy age are
iodine deficient, most of them

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:90%
severely iodine deficient.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So when
a child is growing

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:84%
and they're diagnosed with ADD,
ADHD and they're put on Ritalin

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
or they're put on some
pharmaceutical medication,

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.740 align:middle line:84%
they're not addressing the
root cause of the situation.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.600 align:middle line:84%
They're just addressing
the symptoms.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And another big epidemic
is the hormonal imbalance.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:30.050 align:middle line:84%
So does iodine have an effect
on growth hormone for growing

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:90%
adults or growing children?

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%
And how is that balanced out?

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.608 align:middle line:84%
And what have you
noticed over the years?

00:10:35.608 --> 00:10:37.067 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
first off, it's

00:10:37.067 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
known that iodine deficiency
can cause cretinism,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:84%
which is very short
individuals with decreased

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.977 align:middle line:90%
mental abilities.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And there are still
areas of the world

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.390 align:middle line:84%
where that occurs and
still areas of the US

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.770 align:middle line:90%
where that occurs.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And as far as the ADHD Ritalin
example that you gave goes,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.230 align:middle line:84%
I don't think kids are having
a Ritalin deficiency epidemic.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I think they're having a
nutritional and hormonal

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.717 align:middle line:90%
imbalance problem.

00:11:00.717 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And iodine is one
of the things that's

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.710 align:middle line:90%
leading the pack for that.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.498 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how does iodine
actually impact the thyroid?

00:11:06.498 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, we
can't make thyroid hormone

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.698 align:middle line:90%
without iodine.

00:11:09.698 --> 00:11:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And all the thyroid
hormone molecules

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.590 align:middle line:84%
have to have iodine
atoms attached to them.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear the term
T4 or T3, that 4 and 3 means

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
there's four iodine atoms
attached to thyroglobulin in T4

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and three iodine
atoms attached in T3.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.368 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't
have enough iodine,

00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:84%
the thyroid gland
is going to suffer,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:84%
but all the glands
will suffer from that.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr.
Brownstein, how do you

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.320 align:middle line:84%
test children that come
into your office for iodine?

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, the best
way to test anyone for iodine

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.700 align:middle line:90%
is urinary testing.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can do spot
testing where you just

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
collect a urine and spot test it
if someone's not taking iodine.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But once they're taking
iodine, the spot testing

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
becomes unreliable.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And then there becomes
a 24-hour iodine loading

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.828 align:middle line:90%
test which has to be done.

00:11:50.828 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You were one of
the pioneers with Dr. Abraham

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and the iodine loading test.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.838 align:middle line:84%
Can you give us a little
bit of a background on that?

00:11:56.838 --> 00:11:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So Dr.
Abraham had written a letter

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.047 align:middle line:84%
to one of the journals that
I read that he developed

00:12:01.047 --> 00:12:02.030 align:middle line:90%
an iodine loading test.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And it was a little
two-paragraph letter

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:90%
that he wrote.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And I called him
from that letter.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.250 align:middle line:84%
He became interested
in my practice

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.420 align:middle line:84%
because I was in Michigan
in the goiter belt.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And he asked me if we want
to do a study together

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
where we could test the urine
of a couple hundred patients

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and see where everybody's
iodine levels are.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.110 align:middle line:90%
So I flew out to California.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
I met him.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
We instantly formed
a good friendship.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And he taught me how to
do the laboratory work,

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
and we started
studying together.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.770 align:middle line:84%
And about four to six times
a year, I'd go to California

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:33.570 align:middle line:90%
and work with him.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And all the time, I was
sending him samples of urine

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.640 align:middle line:90%
for my patients.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was that over 90%--

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.290 align:middle line:90%
it was over 98%--

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.620 align:middle line:84%
were low in iodine,
the vast majority

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:90%
significantly low in iodine.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And so it was Dr. Abraham who
developed the iodine loading

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:90%
test.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:90%
I had a little help.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
I offered him a
little help with it.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:90%
But really, that was his idea.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And it's really the most
functional test for iodine

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.090 align:middle line:90%
that's out there.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:84%
And the test is done where
you do a first morning urine

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and get rid of it, and then you
take 50 milligrams of iodine

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.500 align:middle line:84%
for an adult. And then you
collect 24 hours of urine

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.510 align:middle line:90%
after that.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And you send a little
sample of urine in,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.528 align:middle line:84%
and we see how much the body
excretes of that 50 milligrams.

00:13:16.528 --> 00:13:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So you can just simply
subtract the numbers

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.220 align:middle line:84%
and figure out how much
is the body hanging

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:90%
onto from those 50 milligrams.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.400 align:middle line:84%
And what we found was
that for healthy people,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
when they have iodine
sufficiency, about 95%

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.940 align:middle line:90%
is excreted of 50 milligrams.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.920 align:middle line:84%
So 45 milligrams comes out, and
the body as a five milligram

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:90%
pool that it utilizes every day.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Now keep in mind we don't
have stores of iodine.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So either we take it in
on a daily basis or we

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.290 align:middle line:90%
become quickly deficient in it.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's how the
loading test was done.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And a loading test can
be done with children.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.620 align:middle line:84%
You just lower the
amount of iodine

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.843 align:middle line:90%
you give them for their size.

00:13:51.843 --> 00:13:53.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's really the
most functional test

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.465 align:middle line:84%
to determine whether iodine
deficiency is there or not.

00:13:56.465 --> 00:13:57.840 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You
brought up a point.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.720 align:middle line:90%
We don't have stores of iodine.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Would you say that
the body stores

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:07.990 align:middle line:84%
the toxic halogens, fluoride-
and bromine-based compounds?

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, we
were designed pretty well

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:90%
by our maker.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
we were designed to do

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:84%
is keep toxic chemicals
from harming us.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.580 align:middle line:84%
So when the body
senses that something

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.490 align:middle line:84%
is toxic like mercury
or bromide or fluoride,

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.998 align:middle line:84%
it quickly binds it
up into the fat tissue

00:14:22.998 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
and tries to store
it away to keep it

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.460 align:middle line:90%
from damaging ourselves.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
The problem becomes that fat
tissue can become quickly

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.980 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed with
toxins, and then it

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
starts binding to other places,
such as nerve tissue or cells

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:90%
or glands.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
problems start to manifest.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.340 align:middle line:84%
But the problems were
manifesting well before that.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:90%
People just didn't know it.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.225 align:middle line:90%
So there are no iodine stores.

00:14:44.225 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
There are really no stores
of bromide and fluoride.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.767 align:middle line:84%
It's the body's
way of just trying

00:14:47.767 --> 00:14:51.440 align:middle line:84%
to sequester those items so
they don't harm the body.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Going back to the
children, I have a teenage son.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.940 align:middle line:84%
During puberty, how important
is it for children-- men,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:90%
girls and boys--

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.905 align:middle line:90%
to be on an iodine supplement?

00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
this was elucidated

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
in the 1920s with the
salt studies with iodine.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'll get into that more
when we get to the salt episode.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But the study was
done in the 1920s

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.950 align:middle line:84%
on iodine in prepubescent
girls and when they were

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.090 align:middle line:90%
going through hormonal changes.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is
when boys and girls

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.610 align:middle line:84%
go through hormonal changes,
their glandular tissue

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
starts to grow, particularly
breast tissue in girls,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.890 align:middle line:84%
and then the other
tissues grow as well.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.250 align:middle line:84%
So girls particularly
become iodine deficient

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:84%
at puberty, more iodine
deficient at puberty

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
because they have more
breast tissue than boys.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.482 align:middle line:90%
So they can manifest it quicker.

00:15:38.482 --> 00:15:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what
are your thoughts

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:84%
on if someone was to
say, am I suffering

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.740 align:middle line:90%
from an iron deficiency?

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Can you name off
some common symptoms

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
that people can look for that
they might be experiencing

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.827 align:middle line:90%
in their daily life right now?

00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, iodine
concentrates in the glandular

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.640 align:middle line:90%
tissue of the body.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And it's concentrated
against a gradient.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's an energy
dependent process.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:84%
It's so important
that our body utilizes

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.880 align:middle line:84%
its energy molecules,
ATP, to move it

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.710 align:middle line:90%
into the glandular tissue.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So that includes the thyroid,
the ovaries, the uterus,

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:90%
the breasts, the pancreas.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So iodine deficiency
will affect those tissues

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:90%
in greater numbers.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:10%
So people who have
thyroid problems

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:10%
can have iodine
deficiency, people

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.340 align:middle line:10%
who have pancreatic
problems, ovarian problems,

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.220 align:middle line:10%
uterine problems, prostate
problems, breast cancer,

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.520 align:middle line:10%
fibrocystic breast
disease, thyroid cancer,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:10%
pancreatic cancer, ovarian,
uterine, prostate cancers

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.170 align:middle line:10%
affecting one in three men.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.690 align:middle line:10%
I say all of this is
being driven in large part

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.760 align:middle line:10%
from iodine deficiency.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I know one of the
things you talk about is cysts.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Can you elaborate on that?

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:44.485 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ovarian, uterine cysts,
fibrocystic breast disease.

00:16:44.485 --> 00:16:46.930 align:middle line:84%
What's the relationship
between the cysts and iodine

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.740 align:middle line:90%
deficiency?

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So one of
iodine's main jobs in the body

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:84%
is to maintain a normal
architecture of the glandular

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:90%
tissue.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:10%
And that, again, includes
the thyroid, ovaries, uterus,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:10%
breasts, prostate, pancreas.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So if we call this normal
glandular tissue, it's normal.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.637 align:middle line:90%
It's the way it should be.

00:17:02.637 --> 00:17:04.720 align:middle line:84%
In iodine deficiency, the
first thing that happens

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:84%
is you get cysts
in those tissues.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.550 align:middle line:84%
If it goes on longer, the
cysts become hard and nodular.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.230 align:middle line:84%
If it goes on
longer, they assume

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.530 align:middle line:84%
the hyperplastic appearance
under a microscope,

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.996 align:middle line:84%
which is a precursor to
cancer in those tissues.

00:17:16.996 --> 00:17:18.579 align:middle line:84%
Now this has been
shown in animal test

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.380 align:middle line:90%
tube and human studies.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.577 align:middle line:84%
And the neat thing
about iodine is

00:17:22.577 --> 00:17:24.369 align:middle line:84%
that in animal test
tube and human studies,

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.200 align:middle line:90%
iodine's been shown to reverse--

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:84%
to stop this progression
and reverse it

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.900 align:middle line:90%
wherever it catches it.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.950 align:middle line:84%
Iodine has what's called
antiapoptotic properties,

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
meaning it turns
cancer cells off

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
from rapidly dividing in
animal and test tube studies.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.590 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What would be the
standard medical treatment

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.450 align:middle line:84%
for fibrocystic breast disease
or ovarian or uterine cysts?

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
the standard treatment

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.380 align:middle line:84%
is they'll tell them
to clean up their diet

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and get caffeine
out of their diet.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.550 align:middle line:90%
Stop drinking alcohol.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And really, that's about it
for the standard treatment

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:90%
for fibrocystic breast disease.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine doesn't
acknowledge why it exists,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
and they really don't have
great treatments for it.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that iodine
is the most studied item

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:84%
in fibrocystic breast
disease, and it

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.670 align:middle line:84%
works in the vast majority
of women who take it.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: We actually have a
patient of Dr. Brownstein's who

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.220 align:middle line:84%
suffered from severe fibrocystic
breast disease for years.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Joining us on Skype is Mary Ann.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Mary Ann.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.470 align:middle line:10%
Mary Ann, how long
have you suffered

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:10%
from fibrocystic breast disease?

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:10%
>>MARY ANN: I was
diagnosed with it

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:10%
when I was 35 when I had
my very first mammogram.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm 62 right now.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.400 align:middle line:10%
So that was quite
a few years ago.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.450 align:middle line:10%
So I suffered with it
for quite a few years

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.853 align:middle line:10%
before I told Dr.
Brownstein about it.

00:18:46.853 --> 00:18:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When you
say suffered with it,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
can you give us an idea
of what you went through

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.700 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis?

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.690 align:middle line:10%
>>MARY ANN: My breasts
were like two hard rocks.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.790 align:middle line:10%
I could barely touch them.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.380 align:middle line:10%
They were very, very painful.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
I could barely do
a monthly self-exam

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.890 align:middle line:84%
because I had no idea
what I was feeling.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:10%
And my mammograms were showing
that the cystic disease was

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.630 align:middle line:10%
so severe that if there
was an underlying neoplasm,

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:10%
the mammograms absolutely
could not detect it.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.970 align:middle line:10%
>>EDWARD: What were you
getting as a treatment program

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.215 align:middle line:10%
from your standard
allopathic physicians?

00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:33.230 align:middle line:10%
>>MARY ANN: I was told to use
some vitamin E at that time,

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:38.400 align:middle line:10%
like 400 to 800 units of vitamin
E at that time, which I did.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.250 align:middle line:10%
And I was also told to cut down
on my caffeine intake, which

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.400 align:middle line:10%
I did, which really never
was that much to begin with.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.280 align:middle line:10%
And then I was involved
in numerous biopsies,

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:10%
I mean, numerous ones.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:10%
And thankfully, they
were all negative.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:10%
But my surgeon back
then even told me

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:10%
that someday I would probably
have to have a mastectomy,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:09.230 align:middle line:10%
and he was actually making
my incisions to accommodate

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:10%
that surgery someday.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you even
considered a double mastectomy.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.590 align:middle line:84%
>>MARY ANN: I did because
I felt terrified every day.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:10%
I never knew what was
going on with my breasts

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.620 align:middle line:10%
because nothing could detect it.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Wow.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brownstein,
you tested Mary Ann

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.470 align:middle line:90%
when she came in to see you.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.572 align:middle line:90%
What were your findings?

00:20:32.572 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, when
I first saw Mary Ann--

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.540 align:middle line:90%
I remember the story, Mary Ann--

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:90%
she was a little bit tearful.

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And she was seeing a fibrocystic
breast disease specialist

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.290 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Michigan.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to
convince her to do surgery

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.150 align:middle line:84%
and to have a
bilateral mastectomy.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And she came to me
saying that she's

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:90%
pretty much at that point.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.253 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, have
you ever taken iodine?

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And she's didn't know
anything about it.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Now Mary Ann's a very
smart registered nurse.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know
anything about it.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So I explained to her the
whole iodine glandular issue.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, I've treated
many, many women over the years

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
with iodine for
fibrocystic breast disease.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And I told her it was
the most studied item

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.195 align:middle line:84%
in fibrocystic breast
disease around the world.

00:21:18.195 --> 00:21:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And the success rate of
using iodine to treat

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
fibrocystic breast disease
is around the 80% mark.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So I asked her to not
consider any surgery

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.260 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of months and
give me at least two months

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.023 align:middle line:90%
and see how it goes.

00:21:30.023 --> 00:21:31.690 align:middle line:84%
And I did an iodine
loading test on her.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:84%
She was incredibly
low in iodine.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And we did a Therma-Scan
as a baseline

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.580 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning, which measures
the heat off the breasts, which

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.640 align:middle line:90%
gave a very poor rating for her.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.770 align:middle line:90%
And I placed her on iodine.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And I used a few other
things as whatever

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:51.270 align:middle line:84%
I found deficient, some
other vitamins and minerals.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:84%
But we quickly went up to a
high dose of iodine in her,

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.330 align:middle line:84%
started at 50 milligrams
and went up to 100.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And Mary Ann called me about
two weeks into that therapy

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:03.180 align:middle line:84%
and said they're
already feeling better.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you remember that, Mary Ann?

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:06.030 align:middle line:90%
>>MARY ANN: Yes, I do.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I do.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:90%
It was absolutely astounding.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And then when I went back to
the University of Michigan

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
for a scheduled biopsy,
they could not find the spot

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.170 align:middle line:90%
that they were going to biopsy.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:90%
It was completely gone.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So that was after,
what, one month of treatment?

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>>MARY ANN: Yes.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That's
pretty miraculous.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Now one
other thing with Mary Ann.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
When I first saw Mary Ann, I did
a breast exam the first visit.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Her breasts felt like
foreign objects on her chest.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.040 align:middle line:90%
They were hard and nodular.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And the only thing I can
describe that feeling to,

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:84%
it was like when I took
karate in my younger years

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.010 align:middle line:84%
and the punching bag-- was
that hard, rubbery thing.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:10%
And she was very sore, and
she wouldn't tolerate any even

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.830 align:middle line:10%
mild touch to her breasts.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And when I saw her back for a
recheck visit around six weeks,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:10%
her breasts were at least
50% better, if not more.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I
knew she was on her way.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What kind of dosage
of iodine did Mary Ann take?

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.890 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I put her
on a little higher dose.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So my average dose for most
people is 25 milligrams

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
in our toxic world,
maybe 50 milligrams.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But people who have
glandular disorders

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
or significant problems
that iodine might help,

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:90%
they generally need more.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.620 align:middle line:84%
So I put her on a
little bit more.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And then over the years
as she's stabilized,

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.927 align:middle line:84%
we've been able
to lower her down.

00:23:29.927 --> 00:23:32.140 align:middle line:84%
But she needs a consistent
amount of iodine,

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.130 align:middle line:84%
as we found out about
a year and a half,

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:84%
two years into treatment when
she calls me up out of the blue

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.403 align:middle line:84%
and said, it's not
working anymore.

00:23:40.403 --> 00:23:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what do you
mean it's not working?

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.950 align:middle line:90%
And she said, my pain's back.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember that
phone call, Mary Ann?

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MARY ANN: I do.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.375 align:middle line:84%
I got a little lax
with my Iodoral.

00:23:50.375 --> 00:23:52.820 align:middle line:90%
And I got it back.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I said
to Mary Ann, that's

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:84%
unusual for breast cysts to come
back if you're taking iodine.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:90%
Are you taking it?

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:84%
And there was a long
pause on her end,

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.780 align:middle line:84%
and she said, oops, I
think I forgot to take it

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.650 align:middle line:90%
the last three or four weeks.

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.110 align:middle line:90%
And she went back on it.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.777 align:middle line:84%
I talked to her a
couple of weeks later,

00:24:07.777 --> 00:24:10.990 align:middle line:84%
and she said everything was
fine and back to normal.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, that's an
incredible story, Mary Ann.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much for coming
on and sharing your story.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I hope that that just gives
a lot of hope and faith

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.357 align:middle line:84%
to all the listeners and all
the people watching and all

00:24:23.357 --> 00:24:24.940 align:middle line:84%
the women out there
that are suffering

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
from fibrocystic breast disease.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for coming on.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.170 align:middle line:90%
>>MARY ANN: Thank you.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.420 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr. Brownstein,
if iodine deficiency

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.370 align:middle line:84%
is so rampant, why
is this not being

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.960 align:middle line:90%
taught in medical schools?

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.530 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN:
Well, there's a lot

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:10%
of things not being taught
in medical schools that

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.080 align:middle line:10%
should be taught.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.590 align:middle line:10%
But this is certainly
one of them.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:41.570 align:middle line:10%
And it's a disaster.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.380 align:middle line:10%
And I see medical students.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:90%
I see residents.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They come in my office
for a period of time.

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:47.938 align:middle line:90%
I ask them all about iodine.

00:24:47.938 --> 00:24:49.730 align:middle line:84%
The only thing they've
learned about iodine

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.263 align:middle line:84%
is what I learned
in medical school,

00:24:51.263 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:84%
that iodized salt was one of the
greatest public health miracles

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and the iodine deficiency
epidemic was cured

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.820 align:middle line:90%
from iodized salt in the 1920s.

00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's simply not true.

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And the government's own
NHANES study proved that.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And over the last
40 to 50 years,

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.150 align:middle line:84%
iodine levels have
fallen nearly-- over 50%

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.830 align:middle line:90%
across the United States.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.050 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how
detrimental would this

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:14.810 align:middle line:84%
be to the
pharmaceutical industry

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:18.268 align:middle line:84%
if the iodine revolution really
takes hold and people start

00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:20.810 align:middle line:84%
understanding and doctors start
understanding and prescribing

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:90%
iodine?

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, the
pharmaceutical industry

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.010 align:middle line:84%
does not want to know
about this and does not

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.302 align:middle line:90%
want people to know about this.

00:25:26.302 --> 00:25:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if they get healthy,
they won't need their drugs.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:10%
And iodine deficiency can affect
so many areas of the body,

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:10%
from the thyroid to the brain
to all the glandular tissue

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:40.910 align:middle line:10%
to the muscles, which has a high
iodine concentration, that it

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.493 align:middle line:10%
could really tone down how much
people are buying prescription

00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:44.293 align:middle line:10%
items.

00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:46.348 align:middle line:84%
So they don't want this
information out there.

00:25:46.348 --> 00:25:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Some of
these simple things

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
that just could have such a
huge impact on our health care

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.568 align:middle line:84%
system and reduce
health care costs.

00:25:54.568 --> 00:25:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the biggest
things we're spending money on.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.340 align:middle line:84%
I knew iodine is a big
supplement that could do that.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's just
amazing that we have

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
to live every single day with
knowing the root cause of all

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.210 align:middle line:84%
these situations
and these problems

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.950 align:middle line:84%
that people are
suffering from and then

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.330 align:middle line:84%
watching the allopathic
medical industry treat

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.710 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms of disease
instead of the root cause.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Look, I was
trained in that model.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I bought into that
model in my training.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about how drugs
work, probably 99% of drugs

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.700 align:middle line:84%
work by either poisoning
enzymes or blocking receptors

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.270 align:middle line:84%
Now I don't think we were
designed by our maker

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.280 align:middle line:84%
to have our enzymes
poisoned and our receptors

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:90%
blocked for the long term.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a time and a
place to do those things,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.623 align:middle line:84%
such as an acute heart
attack or an acute stroke.

00:26:43.623 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
I would say you should
be in the nearest

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:84%
ER that's skilled with
taking care of those.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And the drug therapies
can save your life.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:55.370 align:middle line:84%
But for chronic care, those
things are not the way to go

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:57.312 align:middle line:90%
and for promoting health.

00:26:57.312 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not a good idea to
poison things and block

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.320 align:middle line:90%
things in the body.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:84%
So iodine is just
one of many things

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.150 align:middle line:84%
that holistically
can help people

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.358 align:middle line:90%
achieve their optimal health.

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.942 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: There's a
lot of information

00:27:07.942 --> 00:27:09.590 align:middle line:90%
out there on iodine and thyroid.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Most people just
automatically assume

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.410 align:middle line:90%
iodine's for the thyroid.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:90%
But iodine has been shown--

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and you've noticed this and
you've talked about this--

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.830 align:middle line:90%
to detoxify the body as well.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about
the detoxification method

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:84%
or what you've
noticed that iodine

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.040 align:middle line:90%
can detox in someone's body?

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So we mentioned
it earlier with the halides,

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and it's called competitive
inhibition, where

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
one of the halides
can competitively

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.030 align:middle line:84%
inhibit another one,
bind to its receptors,

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.150 align:middle line:84%
and since the body has no
stores of these things,

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.773 align:middle line:84%
it will just release
whatever it is.

00:27:41.773 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of iodine,
if we get too much bromide

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.820 align:middle line:84%
or fluoride, the body will
release iodine and bind

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:90%
too much bromide and fluoride.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.390 align:middle line:90%
That's not a good thing.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And vice versa, if
we get enough iodine,

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.230 align:middle line:84%
the body can release the
bromide and fluoride.

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.530 align:middle line:10%
But iodine has also been
shown to help detoxify mercury

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:58.965 align:middle line:10%
and aluminum and lead.

00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:00.590 align:middle line:10%
And I've done the
measurements on that,

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.900 align:middle line:10%
and I've reported
that in my book.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:10%
So iodine should be part of
any detoxification regimen.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.790 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Do you
notice anyone going

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:10.430 align:middle line:84%
through any of the signs
of Herxheimer reaction

00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:84%
or any detox reactions when
they start taking iodine?

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Sure.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
you need to avoid.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So if someone
hasn't taken iodine

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and they're severely
iodine deficient,

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
you can bet your
money that they're

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:22.520 align:middle line:90%
bromide and fluoride toxic.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.040 align:middle line:84%
So when they start
taking iodine,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
this bromide and fluoride
gets moved around

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and can get released
in the body.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.755 align:middle line:84%
Now if they're not
functioning well,

00:28:29.755 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that can cause a
lot of problems,

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's what's referred to
as the old Herxheimer reaction.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:10%
So one of the ways
to avoid that is

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.620 align:middle line:10%
to take salt with the iodine.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.530 align:middle line:10%
And salt in the
early 20th century

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.750 align:middle line:10%
was one of the ways to
cure bromide toxicity

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.990 align:middle line:10%
because bromide was used in a
lot of medications back then,

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.583 align:middle line:10%
such as Bromo-Seltzer
and some other things.

00:28:50.583 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
Now bromide is still
used in medications today

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.630 align:middle line:90%
but not as much.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
But doctors, when there
was bromide toxicity,

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.705 align:middle line:84%
would give them IVs of
sodium chloride or salt.

00:28:58.705 --> 00:29:00.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
do IVs for this.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.418 align:middle line:90%
We can take it orally.

00:29:01.418 --> 00:29:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
salt deficient as well,

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.600 align:middle line:84%
which we'll touch on
in the salt segment.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.060 align:middle line:84%
But about a teaspoon
of unrefined salt a day

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:84%
when you're taking iodine
will minimize the chance

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.190 align:middle line:84%
of having a Herxheimer
reaction along with maintaining

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.112 align:middle line:90%
adequate hydration.

00:29:15.112 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I'm glad you mentioned
your book, Dr. Brownstein.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:90%
It's one of my favorite books.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.820 align:middle line:84%
"Iodine-- Why You Need It, Why
You Can't Live Without It"--

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:26.510 align:middle line:84%
this is an incredible book
that everybody should read.

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it go into
the details about iodine,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.430 align:middle line:84%
but it goes into the
symptoms, the conditions.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.140 align:middle line:90%
It's an easy-to-read book.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.370 align:middle line:90%
It's very, very informative.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So I highly recommend you
get that book, "Iodine--

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Why You Need It and Why
You Can't Live Without It."

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It's a perfect title for that--

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.322 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Thank you--

00:29:44.322 --> 00:29:45.810 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: --book as well.

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:48.560 align:middle line:84%
So we've been touching
a lot on iodine.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.852 align:middle line:84%
What is the difference
between iodine and iodide?

00:29:52.852 --> 00:29:54.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So the
difference is solely

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:84%
whether there's an
extra electron attached

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.820 align:middle line:90%
to that molecule-- atom or not.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So iodine is the
oxidized form of iodide.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.420 align:middle line:90%
It's lacking an extra electron.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And iodide has a full
complement of electrons

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.680 align:middle line:90%
in its outer shell.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.250 align:middle line:90%
So those are fancy terms.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
people necessarily

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.750 align:middle line:90%
need to understand that.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.740 align:middle line:10%
What they need to understand is
if they're going to use iodine

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.340 align:middle line:10%
for any condition, it is best
to use a combination of iodine

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.550 align:middle line:10%
and iodide because they have
different effects on the body.

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:10%
For example, iodine has been
shown to treat infections.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.160 align:middle line:10%
There's no organism
that's been shown

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:10%
to be resistant to iodine.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, it's used as
Betadine and pre-surgically

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.800 align:middle line:90%
to clean off the skin.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Iodide, on the other
hand, binds to the thyroid

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:43.580 align:middle line:84%
and the stomach and some other
tissues and is needed there.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:45.650 align:middle line:90%
The breasts binds iodine.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So to get the best
whole body results,

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.750 align:middle line:84%
you want to use a combination
of iodine and iodide.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you from
personal experience, when

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:55.580 align:middle line:84%
I tried one form or the
other, the combination

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.166 align:middle line:90%
works much better.

00:30:57.166 --> 00:31:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: OK, so what is the
difference in your opinion

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and experience between nascent
iodine and Lugol's solution?

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So Dr. Lugol
developed Lugol's solution

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.300 align:middle line:90%
in the 1800s.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a 5%
iodine solution that

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.100 align:middle line:84%
was used as the most used
medical item until the 1920s

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.740 align:middle line:84%
and, as I mentioned before, was
used to treat infection, which

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.920 align:middle line:84%
was the number one killer before
antibiotics became in vogue

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:90%
or were developed.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:28.940 align:middle line:84%
Nascent iodine has different
forms of iodine in it.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem I find with
that form of iodine

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.350 align:middle line:84%
is that it's just
not strong enough

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.940 align:middle line:90%
in our world we live in today.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Our exposure to
bromide and fluoride

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.030 align:middle line:90%
have gone through the roof.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, our
iodine requirements

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:42.827 align:middle line:84%
are higher compared
to our predecessors,

00:31:42.827 --> 00:31:44.660 align:middle line:84%
compared to our parents
and our grandparents

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.220 align:middle line:90%
and our great grandparents.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.230 align:middle line:84%
When you couple that with
falling iodine levels

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.760 align:middle line:84%
across the US, we've got a
double whammy with iodine.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:84%
It's created the perfect
storm for all these patients

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.530 align:middle line:84%
suffering with thyroid,
breast, ovary, uterus, prostate

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.600 align:middle line:90%
problems, pancreatic problems.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need to use
larger doses than what's

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.900 align:middle line:90%
in the smaller doses of iodine.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Have you ever had a
case where you've had someone

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:13.840 align:middle line:84%
take too much iodine and seen
any negative effects of, like,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.078 align:middle line:90%
overdosing on iodine?

00:32:15.078 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, sure.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.620 align:middle line:84%
You could take too
much of anything.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.280 align:middle line:84%
You can drink too much
water and cause problems.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.280 align:middle line:84%
But taking too much iodine
is rare, but it does happen.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It's particularly
problematic if someone

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.820 align:middle line:84%
has a autonomously functioning
nodule in their thyroid.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.580 align:middle line:84%
What that means is they've got
a little growth in their thyroid

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.690 align:middle line:90%
that's lost control.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you give iodine,
that little growth

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.760 align:middle line:84%
will start producing a
lot of thyroid hormone,

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and it'll quickly create
a thyrotoxic environment.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So people can get nervous,
jittery palpitations.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.110 align:middle line:90%
Now it's very rare.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.550 align:middle line:84%
I've only had a couple
of cases over 20 years.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.230 align:middle line:90%
But it does occur.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, the
way it's picked up

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:84%
is someone takes iodine,
and they get hyper.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.330 align:middle line:84%
It is cured by not
taking iodine and getting

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.860 align:middle line:90%
that nodule removed.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:84%
But there's very few people
who have allergies to iodine.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:09.013 align:middle line:84%
Iodine's very safe for the
vast majority of people.

00:33:09.013 --> 00:33:10.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: If anyone
watching says,

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.097 align:middle line:84%
hey, I want to start
on iodine tomorrow,

00:33:12.097 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:84%
what would you recommend a
starting dose and a maintenance

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.580 align:middle line:90%
dose?

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:17.580 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, the
best thing they could do

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:10%
is work with a iodine literate
and knowledgeable doctor.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.230 align:middle line:10%
So that's what I
would recommend.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:27.070 align:middle line:10%
If they want to start it on
their own, I would start slow.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:31.360 align:middle line:10%
Just pay attention to
how you're feeling.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.940 align:middle line:84%
My average doses for my
patients is 25 milligrams

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.030 align:middle line:84%
if they're healthy, more if
they have glandular disease.

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's best to
work with someone,

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.450 align:middle line:90%
though, who can follow you.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.550 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I think
relatively it's pretty safe.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I haven't heard
too much of anybody

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.638 align:middle line:84%
having any type of severe
reactions to iodine.

00:33:47.638 --> 00:33:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: We have five
practitioners in our office.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.760 align:middle line:90%
We've been using it since 2000.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.632 align:middle line:84%
We have very rare side
effects with iodine.

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
But there could be side
effects with vitamin C. There

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:90%
can be side effects with water.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.920 align:middle line:90%
It's just very rare.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.490 align:middle line:84%
This is less than
a patient a year

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.615 align:middle line:90%
that has a problem with it.

00:34:02.615 --> 00:34:05.073 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what do you say
to all the people that come in

00:34:05.073 --> 00:34:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and say, I have a shellfish
allergy, I can't take iodine?

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So a
shellfish allergy

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.139 align:middle line:84%
does not guarantee you have
an iodine allergy problem.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:90%
You may.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But I've treated lots of
patients with shellfish allergy

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.500 align:middle line:84%
with iodine, and
they've done fine.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Some can't.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But, again, a true iodine
allergy is very rare.

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.210 align:middle line:84%
But we've actually been
able to treat iodine allergy

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.790 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of patients using the
acupressure technique, NAET.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Mm-hmm.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's a really
good technique.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.370 align:middle line:90%
What about radioactive iodine?

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.310 align:middle line:84%
What's the difference
between a good usable

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.050 align:middle line:84%
form of iodine
versus what they're

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.768 align:middle line:84%
using to treat some thyroid
cancers, radioactive iodine?

00:34:37.768 --> 00:34:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So what you
and I have been talking about

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:45.010 align:middle line:84%
is inorganic, non-radioactive
iodine and iodide together.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:84%
That's contrasted with
radioactive iodine, which

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:52.960 align:middle line:84%
is used in medicine to
treat areas of the body,

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.000 align:middle line:84%
such as a thyroid,
which takes up iodine.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.388 align:middle line:84%
So if you have thyroid
cancer, the idea

00:34:57.388 --> 00:34:58.930 align:middle line:84%
is you give radioactive
iodine, which

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is taken up by the thyroid,
and the radioactivity

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.327 align:middle line:90%
destroys the cancer.

00:35:03.327 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
radioactive iodine is taken up

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.945 align:middle line:84%
whatever iodine's
taken up, coating

00:35:06.945 --> 00:35:09.070 align:middle line:84%
the breasts, the ovaries,
the uterus, the pancreas,

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.150 align:middle line:90%
the prostate.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Not only does it destroy
tissue in those areas,

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.018 align:middle line:90%
but it alters the DNA.

00:35:14.018 --> 00:35:16.060 align:middle line:84%
That's why studies have
shown an increased cancer

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
rate in those treated with
radioactive iodine years

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.770 align:middle line:90%
down the road.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I do not recommend radioactive
iodine for thyroid cancer.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.137 align:middle line:84%
If someone has thyroid cancer,
I recommend having surgery

00:35:27.137 --> 00:35:28.720 align:middle line:84%
before radioactive
iodine so you don't

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.280 align:middle line:90%
damage the rest of the body.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well, you can use
the usable form of iodine

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.737 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate and detoxify the
radioactive iodine, correct?

00:35:36.737 --> 00:35:38.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: That
is totally correct.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr. Brownstein,
what is medical iota phobia?

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
medical iota phobia

00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.860 align:middle line:84%
is the unwarranted fear
of using and recommending

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
doses of iodine use from
previous generations

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.240 align:middle line:84%
of clinicians that
have shown to be

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.460 align:middle line:84%
safe and effective for
treating the symptoms

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:57.070 align:middle line:90%
and signs of iodine deficiency.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Abraham developed that term.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.510 align:middle line:90%
And it's a wonderful term.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's from people
that are generally

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.670 align:middle line:84%
ignorant about iodine literature
and don't know how to use it.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.430 align:middle line:90%
And they're afraid of using it.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.693 align:middle line:84%
So medical iota phobia
unfortunately is rampant today.

00:36:12.693 --> 00:36:14.110 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
I wrote my book

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:84%
was to help cure
medical iota phobia.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: OK, so where can
people go to learn more

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.710 align:middle line:84%
about you, learn more
about your treatments,

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.085 align:middle line:90%
learn more about iodine?

00:36:22.085 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have many other
books that you've written.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.877 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing
I love about you

00:36:25.877 --> 00:36:28.240 align:middle line:84%
is it is a holistic
treatment program.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is different,
and everybody really

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.440 align:middle line:84%
needs a custom holistic
treatment program.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.605 align:middle line:84%
So where can someone find out
more information about you?

00:36:36.605 --> 00:36:38.355 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
they go to my website,

00:36:38.355 --> 00:36:41.950 align:middle line:10%
which is www.drbrownstein.com.

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:45.867 align:middle line:10%
And I've written 15 books, and
I only write about what works.

00:36:45.867 --> 00:36:47.950 align:middle line:10%
When I see it work in the
vast majority of people,

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.600 align:middle line:10%
I become interested
in it, especially

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.370 align:middle line:10%
since I wasn't taught
most of the stuff

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.260 align:middle line:10%
or any of the stuff
in medical school.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And I want to help educate my
patients and others out there

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:59.140 align:middle line:84%
to not have to suffer
with their illnesses

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and to take charge
of their situation

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.590 align:middle line:90%
and educate themselves.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And then they can make
better health care decisions.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.767 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, you said it.

00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:08.590 align:middle line:84%
The true definition of a doctor
is a teacher, not a prescriber.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's so important to
educate people these days.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining us
today, Dr. Brownstein.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We have so much more
ground to cover.

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.680 align:middle line:10%
In the next three
episodes, we'll

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.580 align:middle line:10%
talk about the role of iodine in
the thyroid, glandular cancer,

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:25.060 align:middle line:10%
and the importance of mineral
salt. Part of our mission

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.930 align:middle line:10%
is to dispel the flawed
information concerning iodine

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:32.080 align:middle line:10%
and to correct the
medical literature that's

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:35.260 align:middle line:10%
been misinforming individuals
and medical professionals

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.760 align:middle line:10%
for decades.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Join us on the next episode
of this special four part

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.490 align:middle line:84%
series with Dr. David
Brownstein in which we will

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:45.740 align:middle line:90%
discuss iodine and the thyroid.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm Dr. Edward Group.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.720 align:middle line:84%
