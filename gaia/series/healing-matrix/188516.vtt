But Lane Carlson collects
medicine stories.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at one man's
journey across the world

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.085 align:middle line:84%
where he asks the question,
what's your medicine?

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.437 align:middle line:84%
But the world
throws a lot at you.

00:00:58.437 --> 00:01:04.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.580 align:middle line:90%
My name is Lane Carlson.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.990 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in Minnesota.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And I watched my
family and friends

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:84%
get overprescribed medication
to cling to their greatest

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.360 align:middle line:90%
resource, their health.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
As a kid, I was
diagnosed with depression

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and I knew that pills were not
going to be my way to healing.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So when I got out and
I discovered the world,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I saw that there is
other ways to heal.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So I decided to devote my life,
traveling the world discovering

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.750 align:middle line:84%
healing hands,
miraculous plants,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes bizarre
practices that are

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:90%
making people's lives better.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.204 align:middle line:90%
>> Trust yourself.

different types of healers,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.820 align:middle line:90%
different practitioners.

>> Let it go.

00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>> The premise behind the show
is to discover who these people

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:90%
are and what their medicine is.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My medicine is
shamanic healing.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.375 align:middle line:84%
>> My medicine is
the Wim Hof method.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:10%
>> My medicine is henna.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Sound is my medicine.

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Healing isn't always easy.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Ayahuasca physical sensations
in the body range from

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.980 align:middle line:90%
ecstatic, erotic, to painful.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>> But I'll stop at nothing
to bring that knowledge home.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:90%

>> People need to
get rid of stress.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
They need to shift this
whole focus of materialism

and keeping up with the Joneses.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Discover their heart, what's
happening in their hearts.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Join me on my
healing journey.

00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:44.410 align:middle line:90%
What's your medicine?

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Passion.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.050 align:middle line:90%
I love this.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
That's medicine
in and of itself.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:52.165 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for--

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome, Lane.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.340 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to "The Healing Matrix."

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me on.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.232 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good to have you.

00:02:56.232 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Of all things, how did you get
focused on medicine stories?

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.130 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, this all
started from a young age,

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.640 align:middle line:10%
my personal experience with
some trauma of diagnosed with

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.530 align:middle line:10%
depression as a kid, as you saw.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And this was at
13, 14 years old,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.970 align:middle line:84%
where I was being prescribed
medications for depression.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And I realized,
even at a young age,

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
I remember going
to my mom, like,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.742 align:middle line:84%
do I have to take these things
for the rest of my life?

00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:26.962 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, no, you're
going to get better.

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was like,
what do I gotta do?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.545 align:middle line:90%
Like as just a curious kid.

00:03:29.545 --> 00:03:31.480 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to do?

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Go do happy things.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Go do fun things for yourself.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:34.800 align:middle line:90%
Take care of yourself.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:10%
This is like easy,
natural things to do.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:10%
So I did that.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.190 align:middle line:10%
I started doing
that at a young age,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.100 align:middle line:10%
and I stopped taking
the medication.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And when feelings of
depression and anxiety

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.530 align:middle line:84%
were coming back into
my life later on,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.200 align:middle line:84%
going through a break up,
you know, maybe the career

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.270 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going where
it wanted to, I

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
had these feelings
come up again.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, uh-oh, here
comes that darkness again.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
What do I need to do?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what really
led me on the path.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:84%
That's where I first
found meditation.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.630 align:middle line:84%
I've heard about it, but I
never experienced it myself.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.120 align:middle line:84%
I did a 10-day Vipassana
meditation retreat,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.910 align:middle line:84%
and I found, OK, this is
good, this was grounding,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.447 align:middle line:84%
this is for me to really
come back into my body.

00:04:12.447 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's when-- then
I went and discovered

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:90%
and I found Ayahuasca.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.950 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh my--

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.339 align:middle line:84%
it's like a whole
new world opened up

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:90%
for me, this healing world.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:84%
And different healers
and practitioners

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.920 align:middle line:90%
started coming into my life.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a beautiful
experience for myself,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
that's when I wanted to
start sharing these stories.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led me to
start What's Your Medicine.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So really, it was just my own
curiosity to help heal myself,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and then finding such
great benefits within it

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.680 align:middle line:84%
all that I wanted to start
sharing these types of stories.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.377 align:middle line:84%
>> So before we dive into that--
and I can't wait to do that--

00:04:47.377 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
let's just go back for a moment.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.380 align:middle line:84%
And where do you suppose
this depression sensation was

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:90%
coming from, such an early age?

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.290 align:middle line:84%
What might have been
going on for you?

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I was asking myself a
lot of those questions,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:90%
especially at 13, 14 years old.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, why me?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Nothing that I could
put my finger on.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.920 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any
big event in my life

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:90%
that happened to that point.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:90%
There was no loss.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:90%
It was really interesting to me.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.040 align:middle line:90%
So I did a spiritual side.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.100 align:middle line:84%
I did my master's course
in spiritual psychology.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And we did this thing called
the genogram, which basically

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:90%
maps out your family history.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So think of a family tree but
with trauma, understanding

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.277 align:middle line:84%
where anxiety, depression,
where alcoholism,

00:05:33.277 --> 00:05:34.860 align:middle line:84%
where different
cancers are coming in.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And I mapped all of
this, just interviewing

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
different relatives
in my family.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And understanding where
this energy is coming from.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.800 align:middle line:90%
And I got to see.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:90%
I was like, oh, wow.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:84%
No one ever talked about
this in my family, a genogram

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
understanding where all
of these, the anxieties,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.768 align:middle line:84%
depressions, the
alcoholism, like

00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:90%
all of this that was coming in.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, here I am, kind
of at that focal point

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:90%
of all of this coming through.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Recipient, yes.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm like, oh, OK.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.853 align:middle line:84%
But I also understood
why my mom and dad

00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:06.020 align:middle line:90%
went through the same thing.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.480 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of family
members went through this,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:90%
but no one talked about it.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And so my job, where
I felt was like,

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.907 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, this is
not a bad thing.

00:06:13.907 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.450 align:middle line:84%
This was my job to kind of
bring this to the forefront.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.820 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I understand it.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
It was an energy thing
that was coming through.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And I also researched
a little bit on this.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:90%
You also become a part of--

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
think of your family
as your tribe.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you're witnessing your mom
or your dad going through this,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.710 align:middle line:90%
it's almost like this belonging.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take
on this disease

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to take on this
feeling because you have it

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.045 align:middle line:90%
And now I belong to my tribe.

00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Now I belong, too.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And so there's a little
bit of that in there as well.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.437 align:middle line:84%
So that was my understanding
of how this came into my being

00:06:48.437 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and what I need to
do in this lifetime

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.815 align:middle line:84%
to help heal that and also
heal that for next generations.

00:06:53.815 --> 00:06:56.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't want this to
keep going on for other people.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And science is certainly
showing us today

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.590 align:middle line:84%
that we have an impact
on genetically what

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.760 align:middle line:90%
we have inherited.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to live
that out, if we just

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
recognize the truth of who we
are, that we're actually here

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to transform that
into something new.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.932 align:middle line:84%
But at 13, at 11, at, 10,
at 5, we don't know that.

00:07:15.932 --> 00:07:17.140 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how to do that.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.300 align:middle line:90%
>> At 13, you're like--

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
and I remember sitting
down to go to the doctor

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and they're telling
me, you know--

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
it was literally
like a storybook.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.670 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting in
this big mahogany desk

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.222 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
in and this person

00:07:29.222 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:90%
has zero connection with you.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
well, as you come

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
in, they're writing
on a prescription pad,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.040 align:middle line:90%
prescriptions to Prozac.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, what
just happened?

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:90%
I have no idea.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.665 align:middle line:84%
I have no connection
with this person.

00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
You know nothing about me
but you're prescribing me

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:90%
a medication at 13 years old.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.020 align:middle line:90%
You know, like bananas.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You decide to take
matters into your own hands.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:84%
You moved into
finding your medicine.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.170 align:middle line:90%
And how did you do that?

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:90%
How did you find your medicine?

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.430 align:middle line:10%
>> From the young age
or from the older age?

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.250 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'll say both.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
So from the young age,
I found my medicine

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:84%
when all's it was was that my
mom planted a seed in my head.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
She said, you just need to
do fun things for yourself.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.760 align:middle line:90%
What makes you happy?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.825 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, well, I love sports,
I love to play baseball,

00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:18.800 align:middle line:84%
I love to go outside,
I like to run,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I love to go do funny movies.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.345 align:middle line:90%
She's like, go do that.

00:08:21.345 --> 00:08:22.470 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get better.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.178 align:middle line:84%
So it was her planting
that seed of, this

00:08:24.178 --> 00:08:25.400 align:middle line:90%
isn't going to last forever.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.200 align:middle line:90%
This is temporary.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:84%
We all go through these
times of darkness.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:90%
And you're going to be OK.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.613 align:middle line:84%
And so it was that glimmer
of hope that she gave me.

00:08:33.613 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's all
people need is like--

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> She kept the
door open for you.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.179 align:middle line:90%
>> You're going to be OK.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.346 align:middle line:90%
Like, it's going to be fine.

00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:40.750 align:middle line:84%
You need to start doing these
fun things for yourself.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And when that started
coming up later on in life,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.690 align:middle line:90%
I was like, OK, I know my body.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:90%
I know this.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.752 align:middle line:84%
But I also know my past had
been, OK, I'm feeling bad,

00:08:50.752 --> 00:08:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
party, or I'm going

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:90%
to go hang out with my friends.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, eh, it just
isn't me anymore.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
else is going on inside.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And so it wasn't
always the relationship

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.330 align:middle line:90%
that was the problem.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.750 align:middle line:84%
It was why is this
coming up in my life?

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to discover a lot
of that, a lot of my own truths

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
that I was living, a lot of
what my ego was telling me

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:90%
I should be.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And it was nice to
be able to peel back

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that layer and kind of
see the truth of who I am

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and how I need to stand
forward in this life,

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.270 align:middle line:90%
and what I need to do.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:90%
So finding that meditation.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
meditation is really

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.428 align:middle line:90%
my biggest medicine right now.

00:09:25.428 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:90%
It's what I wake up with.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, OK, that's the
one thing I know I can go to

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:90%
and trust is safe.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's been very powerful.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So you know, we talk
about meditation as medicine.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we could define
for our viewers

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.540 align:middle line:90%
what medicine means to you.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
You travel the world saying,
what's your medicine?

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.675 align:middle line:84%
What does medicine-- let's
just start foundationally.

00:09:45.675 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:84%
What are we looking
at when we're

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.480 align:middle line:90%
asking about medicine itself?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:90%
And first, I'll give the--

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.120 align:middle line:84%
when I first heard medicine,
I always think clinical

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:90%
and I always think pills.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And so part of my
medicine now is

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.240 align:middle line:90%
redefining what medicine means.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Medicine is beautiful.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So what medicine means now
for me is medicine is nature.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:90%
Medicine's breath.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:90%
Medicine can be sun.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Medicine is redefined into
so many different avenues

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And so medicine is
what brings you back

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
to that loving place,
what brings you back

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:84%
to that natural place of
equanimity within your life

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:90%
and with your body.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:90%
That's medicine.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Medicine.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Like a salve for the
soul and coming home.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>> It's like, how do I come
back to that innocent place

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.140 align:middle line:90%
as a baby?

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Because as babies, you're grown
into this bliss of just love.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:90%
And that's medicine.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So how do I get
back to that place?

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:90%
>> They haven't forgotten yet.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:40.978 align:middle line:90%
They haven't forgotten.

00:10:40.978 --> 00:10:42.700 align:middle line:90%
How do I get back to that place?

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.260 align:middle line:90%
What's going to bring me there?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:46.870 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Part of Lane's work is to seek
out and test unconventional

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.690 align:middle line:90%
technologies and therapies.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Take a look at
the Theta Chamber.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Loren.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And the Theta Chamber
is my medicine.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.100 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:84%
So we have a theta bed. we're
at the Theta Wellness Center.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
This is one of their
signature pieces here.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
So it brings you
into theta rest.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about when
you go to sleep at night,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.470 align:middle line:84%
this is what brings
you the restorative.

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.283 align:middle line:84%
It regenerates your body,
gets you back into a healing.

00:11:17.283 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I
really trust all this.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:20.975 align:middle line:84%
So I've got to go check
this out for myself.

00:11:20.975 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm actually a little bit
scared because this thing spins

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.110 align:middle line:84%
and I'm a little
bit claustrophobic.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.710 align:middle line:84%
These look like
some fun Burning Man

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
goggles that spit
lights at your eyes.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So this is going to
be one hell of a trip.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.020 align:middle line:84%
What do the goggles
do, by the way?

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Light therapy.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:84%
This will only produce
white, but your brain

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.600 align:middle line:84%
will interpret to be other
colors as well as patterns.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Inserting light
therapy goggles.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
We should have a
sound effect for this.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
(SPEAKING IN ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER'S VOICE) I'll

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.390 align:middle line:90%
be back.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:90%
That went really quick.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.155 align:middle line:84%
I feel like I was in
an Ayahuasca ceremony.

00:11:55.155 --> 00:11:57.522 align:middle line:84%
[IMITATES EXPLOSION]
I want to go back.

00:11:57.522 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:90%
That was great.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I literally felt
like I was on top of a cloud.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And when I say DMT experience,
for those of you at home

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.880 align:middle line:84%
that have experienced DMT,
a near-death experience,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.430 align:middle line:84%
that's what you had
that entire time there.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's in your,
you know, definitely

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
some crazy visuals
coming at you.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
But the nothingness you
feel like literally you're

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.114 align:middle line:90%
floating on a cloud.

00:12:22.114 --> 00:12:24.840 align:middle line:90%
And powerful experience.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:84%
There is like some beats
coming into my-- like squeezing

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
or pulsing of my ears, which
was getting the left brain

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.878 align:middle line:90%
and right brain to communicate.

00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:36.420 align:middle line:84%
We also had beautiful
binaural beats.

We had some beautiful
music going through.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.360 align:middle line:90%
So it was just a complete bliss.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.670 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.563 align:middle line:90%
I'm blissed out watching that.

>> So we're going to have to
ask some questions about some

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
of the things that you compared
it to so that our viewers can

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
relate, if they haven't been
through some of those things.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's
just speak about what

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.360 align:middle line:84%
are the benefits of
the theta chamber?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>> So going in--

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:84%
by the way, someone was telling
me about this theta chamber.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.240 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I was like, what is a
spinning bed, binaural beats,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%
light therapy goggles.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.490 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea what
any of this was.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I
gotta go try this out.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
benefits are, it's

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
one thing being explained this,
but when you experience it,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.710 align:middle line:90%
it's a whole different level.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.048 align:middle line:84%
So theta rest, when we
go to sleep at night,

00:13:23.048 --> 00:13:24.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, you go to
sleep, that's that wave

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that your body and
your brain is going

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:90%
to meet at to heal naturally.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So our bodies are just
beautiful instruments in order

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.280 align:middle line:90%
to find that healing.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.150 align:middle line:84%
So when we're in trauma
or we're suffering

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:84%
from post-traumatic stress
or any type of brain injuries

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to bed
with that constant stress,

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
we're not allowing our
bodies to naturally heal.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this bed does
is it allows you to finally get

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.180 align:middle line:90%
into that restful place.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.847 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not
in your head anymore.

00:13:49.847 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
You're not in a
stressed out place.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're not in that
fight or flight mode.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:90%
You're in theta rest.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, 45
minutes into that chamber

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:90%
went by in like 5 minutes.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.550 align:middle line:90%
So you don't experience time.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And in that place, your
body's just finally letting go

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
and you have no concept
of what time is.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:84%
You're just allowing your
body to naturally heal.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
then is your body

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.790 align:middle line:84%
naturally produces serotonin and
dopamines to actually bring you

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
back to that beautiful
place that we were talking

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.490 align:middle line:84%
about as a baby, as that infant,
as that beautiful, natural

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.570 align:middle line:90%
healing place.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.610 align:middle line:90%
That's what that theta bed does.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Also with the light
therapy goggles,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
it's a computer-generated
program

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
that will allow your brain to
start creating neural pathways

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.200 align:middle line:84%
and connections again that
are harmonious to your body.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And same with the
binaural beats.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So allowing the left
and right hemispheres

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:84%
to finally communicate in
a harmonious way, where

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
if you've had some
neurological damage

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.870 align:middle line:84%
or you're suffering
from an addiction,

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:55.380 align:middle line:84%
it's creating greater pathways,
again, of communication

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
to allow your body to naturally
be in that state of bliss,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.850 align:middle line:90%
in that state of healing.

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So when I say it was a soup of
healing, that's what it was.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:05.880 align:middle line:90%
You're spinning.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.255 align:middle line:84%
You've got light
therapy goggles.

00:15:07.255 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:84%
You got beautiful music
going in and binaural beats.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And so coming out of that,
do you have a better sense

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.470 align:middle line:90%
of what?

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.460 align:middle line:90%
What is the benefit?

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.470 align:middle line:84%
How does someone
translate that experience

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
into changing how they are
able to be self-healing or live

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.840 align:middle line:84%
in this life more
comfortably or whole?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll give it from my example,
in the beginning was after that

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
experience in that bed,
you come out and you just,

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like you've been in
the most restful vacation that

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.050 align:middle line:90%
you've ever been on.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.390 align:middle line:90%
And so your interest of--

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.460 align:middle line:84%
the last thing you want
to go do is, let's say,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.560 align:middle line:84%
go grab a cigarette
or go drink or go

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.330 align:middle line:90%
do anything toxic in your body.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:90%
You're more aware.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're more in that
state of, wow, this

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.380 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful instrument
that I am in right now

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:90%
and I want to take care of it.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And so you're in
that place of, I

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:84%
don't want to harm
this vessel right now.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you're in that
place of bliss and love.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:06.828 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in
that, you think about

00:16:06.828 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:84%
that you're in that
vibration, you're

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:84%
also going to attract
that vibration around you.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And so that's what I felt.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And with addicts
that are going there.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.060 align:middle line:84%
They're treating a lot of
addicts within the Theta

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:90%
Wellness Center.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, what that's
doing for them is the same.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.180 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing that two
or three times a week,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:84%
some people are going in
there every single day.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's curbing that
addiction pattern.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Because you're changing the
neural pathways in your brain

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and in your body, you're
less likely to go back

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:36.930 align:middle line:90%
to these old patterns.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Because you're changing
the chemistry of your body.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the Theta
Wellness and that's

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.980 align:middle line:84%
what the theta chamber does
for these addicts as well.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.720 align:middle line:10%
It's creating the body
chemistry in order

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.580 align:middle line:10%
for them to change behaviors.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
doing that, you're

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:90%
creating a whole new being.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.597 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going to
these vices of like,

00:16:53.597 --> 00:16:54.930 align:middle line:90%
I've got to have this one thing.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.570 align:middle line:84%
It's like, no, I've just
experienced this bliss.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And it allows you to
stay on that vibration.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So you achieve that same
state in meditation?

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Do you get to that same--

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.180 align:middle line:90%
so it's a similar.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.349 align:middle line:84%
So for our viewers
that are meditators

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
that haven't been
in a theta chamber,

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.569 align:middle line:84%
is it kind of producing
a similar effect?

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Similar effect.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you're in that
state of within a really

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.869 align:middle line:84%
good deep meditation,
your thoughts

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
are not on job or something
in the past, injuries.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.030 align:middle line:84%
You're in that place of, you
want to think nothingness.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And within that
nothingness, you can

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
allow your body to heal and
to function in its proper way.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's what the theta
chamber did for me.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So it kind of
acts as a reset.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So gets you over the hump
or through a threshold

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.933 align:middle line:84%
so that you can
begin from the new,

00:17:42.933 --> 00:17:44.850 align:middle line:84%
having had a different
experience than the one

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:46.562 align:middle line:90%
that you've been in recently.

00:17:46.562 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a great way of thinking
about it is a factory reset

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:90%
button.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.890 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is that reset
button every morning.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Like, how do I want
to start my day?

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.550 align:middle line:84%
You know, the first 20,
30 minutes of your morning

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.410 align:middle line:84%
can really tell what
the course of your life

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
or the course of your
day was going to be.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So if I can start in
that place of at least

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:84%
I can control this
first 30 minutes

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:84%
of my day, in that
nice, peaceful place,

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.820 align:middle line:90%
let's see where that goes.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> What other modalities have
you explored and discovered

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.380 align:middle line:90%
that have been game changers?

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:16.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, man.

00:18:16.494 --> 00:18:17.294 align:middle line:90%
Where do I begin?

00:18:17.294 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Any big ones that
were significant for you?

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Ayahuasca was a big
game changer for me.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And Ayahuasca was
something I heard about.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
I started hearing
stories about it.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.477 align:middle line:90%
But I did a complete--

00:18:27.477 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I did two years of research
before I dove, before I

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.032 align:middle line:90%
went and did a ceremony.

00:18:31.032 --> 00:18:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I always
tell everybody else is like,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:90%
do your research.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:84%
This may not be
something for you.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.950 align:middle line:84%
And so that was one that
really changed my life.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.330 align:middle line:84%
And I experienced what
people call an ego death.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And it allowed me to really
think differently about myself.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I was going through a
breakup at that time.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And it allowed me to
finally cry and just let

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
go of the pain
and the depression

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and the feelings
of non-worthiness,

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and just let go.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And that was such a
powerful experience for me.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:84%
And I did quite a
bit of work with that

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:84%
in the last 5 and 1/2 years was
a lot of deep Ayahuasca work.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
We did a documentary
on Ayahuasca.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
One of our episodes
is on there, learning

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.710 align:middle line:84%
how to make the medicine,
what it does to your body.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that was a very
big game changer for me.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And I think about
it this way, it's

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.900 align:middle line:84%
like talk about a
factory reset button

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.335 align:middle line:90%
and you're like, OK, cool.

00:19:25.335 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Now what else is out there?

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And you start attracting
different people in your life.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Your interests start changing.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.250 align:middle line:84%
So my happy hours, going
to the bar with friends

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.600 align:middle line:90%
was like-- not that that's bad.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.735 align:middle line:90%
I'm not saying it's bad.

00:19:37.735 --> 00:19:38.610 align:middle line:90%
But it was different.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.257 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't attracted
to that anymore.

00:19:40.257 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That was your medicine.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:41.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That was my medicine.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:90%
>> And now it is not.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> And now it's not.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.740 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes that's
people's medicine.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't like, I
can't wait for the weekend

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.720 align:middle line:90%
so I can go to the bars.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Like, no.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:90%
It just wasn't there anymore.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.342 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd actually rather
take care of myself.

00:19:56.342 --> 00:19:58.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd rather take care-- and
my interests in food changed.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And again, not saying that
the old stuff was bad.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.790 align:middle line:84%
It was just, I
became more aware.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:90%
My palate changed.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.160 align:middle line:90%
My interests changed.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.320 align:middle line:90%
The people around me changed.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.598 align:middle line:84%
Where I was putting
my energy changed.

00:20:09.598 --> 00:20:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>> This is what happens
when we start to wake up.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.660 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And I started
thinking about this

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is I've given $100 worth
of energy every single day.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Where are you going
to spend that money?

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And I started becoming
really aware of that.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm like OK, well, if I'm
going to waste $50 of energy

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:84%
on toxic food in the
beginning of the day,

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.585 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be
depleted by 4:00 PM.

00:20:30.585 --> 00:20:31.710 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm going on reserves.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's how
people get depleted.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
Lane is also working
with visionaries

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.210 align:middle line:84%
who are working with
ancestral medicine

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:84%
within a spiritual tradition
and with innovation.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Please take a look at Aya Flow.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> My name is Dennis And
my medicine is Aya Flow

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.712 align:middle line:90%
Microdosing Ayahuasca.

00:20:50.712 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Seeing the potential of
the medicine Ayahuasca

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.990 align:middle line:84%
and the visions they have and
the healings that happen there,

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.420 align:middle line:84%
what I've seen that many
people after they come out

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.810 align:middle line:84%
of ceremony, they sometimes
are a bit lost and slowly going

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:84%
back to where they came from,
the same pattern, same habits,

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:90%
not shifting many things.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:84%
How do I keep this beautiful
high vibrational energy up,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.250 align:middle line:84%
keep the connection with
the medicine that I feel?

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
How do I go back in the Western
world with all my relationship

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.640 align:middle line:84%
work and bring those
two worlds together?

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
I was looking,
what can we create

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.980 align:middle line:84%
to keep people connected to the
medicine in a general way, more

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.780 align:middle line:90%
day-to-day way?

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:31.315 align:middle line:84%
How can we build
a community where

00:21:31.315 --> 00:21:32.690 align:middle line:84%
people feel
supported, where they

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:90%
can share their experiences?

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And how can we
build practices that

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.620 align:middle line:84%
support your body, the
nervous system especially,

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.320 align:middle line:84%
to really receive
the medicine fully?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Explain how microdosing
Ayahuasca works.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So with Dennis specifically,
he works with a lot of people

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:84%
following ceremony, following
doing an Ayahuasca ceremony.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:90%
This is the first intro.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So you go into an
Ayahuasca ceremony.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And the vine itself is
the non-psychoactive part

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.140 align:middle line:90%
of Ayahuasca.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.470 align:middle line:90%
It's made up of two parts.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
There's a chakruna,
which is a leaf,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and the vine, which
is the Ayahuasca vine.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And so when combined, you have
that psychedelic experience

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.730 align:middle line:90%
in a full-on Ayahuasca ceremony.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:10%
And what has been
happening a lot with people

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.510 align:middle line:10%
going within ceremonies and
doing a lot of plant medicine

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:10%
work is they're
missing the link, which

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:10%
is the integration part of it.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
It's like going to the greatest
convention or the greatest

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.950 align:middle line:84%
workshop of your life and
you're like, I need to do this.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And then you go back to
your old patterns and stop,

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:84%
and you don't do what
you've been taught.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.100 align:middle line:84%
So an Ayahuasca ceremony
is a big teaching.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And what Denis discovered,
and many other people have,

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.410 align:middle line:84%
is people are losing that
connection to what they've

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:51.140 align:middle line:84%
been taught and not integrating
that knowledge into their life.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why
he created this

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:84%
the Ayahuasca microdosing was to
keep the medicine in your body.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's the
non-psychoactive part.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:10%
So the Ayahuasca vine
still works within the body

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.680 align:middle line:10%
and helps create new
pathways of communication

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.950 align:middle line:10%
within your body
to heal naturally.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.900 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest
part with Aya Flow

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
is the integration workshops
that he's going to do with you.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like a coaching
that someone's doing with you

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:90%
on a daily or weekly pattern.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's continuous
check ins with people.

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an action
plan that you need to do,

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.650 align:middle line:84%
or in my Ayahuasca
ceremony I saw

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.660 align:middle line:90%
that I needed to switch jobs.

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:33.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we see this, we know
that you need to do that.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.503 align:middle line:84%
Your higher self is telling
you to do something.

00:23:35.503 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to keep
you in the medicine.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.320 align:middle line:90%
It's non-psychoactive.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:90%
It's working within your body.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.340 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also going to
work with you as a coach.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:84%
Or think of it as a
accountability buddy

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:51.010 align:middle line:84%
is what he is, to help bring
you along this process.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's the biggest
part of Aya Flow

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.750 align:middle line:84%
is to keep the medicine
within your body,

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:90%
to keep that practice.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
People are doing
this, by the way,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
with psilocybin microdosing,
with LSD microdosing.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
It's to keep that information
and keep that knowledge

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and allowing your
body to heal, but then

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:84%
also integrate that
knowledge in a practical way.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do you check out
who's administering such

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.930 align:middle line:84%
programs and make sure
that someone is getting

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:17.840 align:middle line:90%
into the right hands?

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great question.

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:10%
And by the way, I had no
idea when I first started.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.030 align:middle line:10%
I did two years of research.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.390 align:middle line:10%
And I had to find somebody.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And I trusted my
intuition, first of all.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But I also, when I
met a different healer

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
or a practitioner, I would
end up talking to the people

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.340 align:middle line:90%
that they worked with.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.420 align:middle line:90%
Do I resonate with these people?

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not just taking
information and going off

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and going to the
jungle to someone

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.110 align:middle line:90%
that I don't know off a whim.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I need to understand.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.708 align:middle line:84%
And people have to
understand this,

00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:52.450 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to
go to a school, let's

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.670 align:middle line:84%
say, like you want to
check out the school,

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.650 align:middle line:84%
you want to read
some reviews on it,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.150 align:middle line:84%
you want to go meet some
people that have actually

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.020 align:middle line:90%
gone to the school.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Same with a teacher or
same with a practitioner.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Do your research.

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And your body, and trust your
intuition on that as well

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It's certainly important.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Very important.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:84%
>> More and more people are
opening their minds to explore

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.280 align:middle line:84%
alternatives for
profound healing.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.810 align:middle line:84%
We have the privilege
today to talk

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:21.130 align:middle line:84%
with former Chicago Blackhawks
player Daniel Carcillo.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Two-time Stanley
Cup winner, Daniel

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.900 align:middle line:84%
was one of the best
players in the world.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.710 align:middle line:84%
That was, until the consequences
of repeated concussions

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.180 align:middle line:90%
caught up with him.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.395 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Daniel.

00:25:32.395 --> 00:25:33.865 align:middle line:90%
>> What's up, Daniel?

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you, Lane?

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:90%
Good to see you.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Good to see you.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It's great to hear
your story in person.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Daniel, you had
a bout with CTE.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:50.150 align:middle line:90%
You had a development there.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a
little bit about this?

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:10%
So I think that a lot
of professional athletes

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:10%
are worried about
contracting not only CTE

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:10%
but neurological degenerative
disease after being exposed

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.900 align:middle line:10%
to so much repetitive
head trauma.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I advocate for is CTE

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.710 align:middle line:84%
can only be
diagnosed postmortem.

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:14.020 align:middle line:84%
So there's a list of
symptoms that a lot of us

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:90%
are experiencing.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And these symptoms
come from brain injury,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
which come from
brain damage, which

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:25.090 align:middle line:84%
causes cognitive dysfunction
and puts us more at risk

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:90%
for neurological disease.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.500 align:middle line:84%
But that does not mean
that we are certainly going

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:90%
to get a neurological disease.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And I like to advocate
for this and this mission

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.670 align:middle line:84%
and to show people that
you can recover your brain

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:45.850 align:middle line:84%
health by turning to
anti-inflammation plant

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.300 align:middle line:84%
medicine, as well as at
the core of our healing

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.800 align:middle line:84%
is neuroregenesis
and neuroplasticity.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So you can introduce
things like mushrooms

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.692 align:middle line:84%
into your daily
life that promote

00:26:56.692 --> 00:26:58.150 align:middle line:84%
the right and left
brain hemisphere

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:84%
communicating and that
also have been shown

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.460 align:middle line:84%
in double blind placebo
studies to break up things

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
like amyloid protein,
the same protein that

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:10.210 align:middle line:84%
causes these neurological
degenerative diseases.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.450 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of the
initial symptoms that you were

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.130 align:middle line:90%
experiencing?

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Light sensitivity, slurred
speech, concentration issues,

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:90%
loss of appetite.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%
A lot of impulse control issues.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:84%
Insomnia, anxiety,
depression, and then

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:90%
ultimately suicidal ideation.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And unlike Lane and
other people who

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.270 align:middle line:84%
are born with these
mental illnesses

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.150 align:middle line:84%
and these neurological
imbalances, mine,

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:45.010 align:middle line:84%
I really had to learn about
it around the age of 25

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to figure out what was going
on and to really correct it.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:50.980 align:middle line:90%
You can move into recovery.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
these concussion clinics

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:55.420 align:middle line:90%
that I went to.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would just caution people
to be careful with those.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Because at the core
of our healing,

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.750 align:middle line:84%
we have to flesh
out inflammation

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and we have to promote
neuroregenesis.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
that that's done

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.240 align:middle line:90%
in front of computer screens.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And so what I did was
I checked my hormones.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
I Checked. what my pituitary
gland was naturally creating

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:90%
inside of my body.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned to
plant medicines, like CBD.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.010 align:middle line:84%
I had a hero dose of
psilocybin to really wake me up

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:84%
from my anxiety, depression,
and suicidal thoughts.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And now I actively
micro dose to continue

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.040 align:middle line:84%
introducing the
medicine into my body

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and I keep up with
certain plant medicines

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.220 align:middle line:84%
that flush out the inflammation
that's in my brain.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:41.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're not
having these symptoms.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:90%
>> None of them?

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:90%
None of the symptoms?

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.070 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.760 align:middle line:10%
So there's anxiety and
depression that still comes,

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:10%
but it's much less intense.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.150 align:middle line:90%
So before it used to last--

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.330 align:middle line:84%
it was pretty much every
day and it would last

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:57.898 align:middle line:90%
either all day or for weeks.

00:28:57.898 --> 00:28:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And progressively it was
getting worse and worse.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
So now when it comes back,
if comes back for an hour.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I can use
my tools that I've

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.320 align:middle line:84%
acquired, like mindfulness,
like deep belly breathing,

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.030 align:middle line:84%
like holotropic breath work,
and simple stuff like yoga,

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and making sure
that I'm hydrated

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and looking at my diet to see
what I ate the night before

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.180 align:middle line:90%
if I wake up edgy.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:21.730 align:middle line:84%
Because it usually has
something to do with what

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.080 align:middle line:90%
I put in my stomach.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And the gut-brain axis
is really, really strong.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So six months ago,
I was lucky enough,

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:31.360 align:middle line:84%
before I went on this
journey, to do an EEG.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And that showed my
alpha theta beta,

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.810 align:middle line:84%
my waves were just way off,
all red in certain areas.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
back five months ago

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.720 align:middle line:84%
to basically confirm
through science how I feel,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.440 align:middle line:84%
so that people can't just
deny my anecdotal story.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.090 align:middle line:84%
When they do that,
then I can show them

00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:53.200 align:middle line:84%
my test results that I
have no abnormalities now.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And all this started
after the concussions.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just repetitive chronic
concussed state landed you

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:90%
with that symptom pattern.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So weakened axons,
weakened myelin sheath.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.530 align:middle line:84%
That's how our
brain communicates.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And over, really since
I was four years old,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.540 align:middle line:90%
we started hitting in hockey.

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And so as my brain
was developing,

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.500 align:middle line:90%
it was also breaking down.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And now I can confidently
say that at the age of 35

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.950 align:middle line:90%
I've never felt better.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And when I did end up
winning my Stanley Cups,

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I spiritually and mentally
and physically dead.

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And what kind of support did
you get from the NHL at this

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.730 align:middle line:90%
time--

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> None.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>> --when you were struggling.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.770 align:middle line:90%
Nothing?

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I've been effectively
blackballed from the NHL

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:49.330 align:middle line:90%
and from the NHLPA.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I watched my best
friend, Steve Montador,

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.650 align:middle line:84%
who was cleared for upwards of
10 concussions in his career,

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:03.100 align:middle line:84%
I watched him slowly
deteriorate and slowly, slowly

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.870 align:middle line:90%
die right in front of my eyes.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.045 align:middle line:84%
And I've been very outspoken
and very honest and vulnerable

00:31:09.045 --> 00:31:10.420 align:middle line:84%
about my journey,
because I don't

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.950 align:middle line:90%
want to see it happen again.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.700 align:middle line:84%
And because of
that, the Blackhawks

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:16.990 align:middle line:90%
have turned their back on me.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The NHLPA has turned
their back on me.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And so has the
NHL, which is very,

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.340 align:middle line:84%
it has to be
expected, right, when

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:84%
you have a lawsuit
against them and when

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be a critical
witness for Steve's case.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And Steve's case
has the potential

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:84%
to change the
world, to change how

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.370 align:middle line:84%
we view sport-related
concussion,

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:90%
because there's no such thing.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Just like if you
leave this studio

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and you get into a
car accident, you

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.280 align:middle line:84%
don't say that you got into
car accident concussion, right?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.540 align:middle line:84%
You just say that you
have a brain injury.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So these terms are made
up to confuse jurors.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm trying to do is
get as healthy as possible

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
so that when I do get on the
stand and these lawyers attack

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.070 align:middle line:84%
my drug use and Steve's
substance abuse history

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.570 align:middle line:84%
and I can really be
zen and just point them

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.830 align:middle line:84%
in a direction that's
non-emotional and just really

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:10.900 align:middle line:84%
help people understand
what's going on

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.870 align:middle line:90%
with traumatic brain injury.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So you decided to
do something about it

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.840 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.480 align:middle line:90%
And you began an inquiry.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Did you do research
prior to engaging

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.050 align:middle line:90%
in these alternative practices?

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:30.310 align:middle line:84%
How did you find a
safe place to begin?

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> The internet.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And then just when I read
something that I thought

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.740 align:middle line:84%
was credible, then I
researched who was writing it.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I kept
reading about them.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And then if that all panned out
and there weren't any biases,

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.550 align:middle line:90%
then I listened and I tried it.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is how
I've healed myself.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And I say that I've healed
myself, because I really

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.130 align:middle line:84%
have taken it upon myself to go
out, research every single day,

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:06.190 align:middle line:84%
read these medical studies, and
just put two and two together.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Introducing a chemical imbalance
onto a chemical problem

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.550 align:middle line:84%
in your brain is probably
not the smartest thing to do.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Flushing out
inflammation and creating

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:21.430 align:middle line:84%
new neurological pathways
around your dead neurons

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.140 align:middle line:84%
and stimulating
areas of your brain

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.580 align:middle line:84%
that were shut
down due to trauma

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.960 align:middle line:84%
just makes a whole
lot of sense to me.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.160 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not a doctor, but I
feel like I'm pretty well read.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And over the last four years,
I read every single day

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:38.170 align:middle line:84%
and I listen and I
have phone calls.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.970 align:middle line:84%
And when I go to these
concussion clinics,

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.240 align:middle line:90%
I asked, well, what did you see?

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Is there atrophy?

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:47.080 align:middle line:84%
And if there is,
how can I fix it?

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And when some of those
people in clinics

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.880 align:middle line:84%
didn't have answers
for me, then you just

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:84%
have to go out and seek out
the information on your own.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And it should be hard to find.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
Because big pharma's model
is to take a daily pill

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:90%
to minimize these symptoms.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, my mission
is to get to the root

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.210 align:middle line:90%
cause of these symptoms.

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:90%
And how did you find Lane?

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Lane found me.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And the source just
brought us together.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And when I say the
source, it's just

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.480 align:middle line:84%
our higher powers and this
mycelium network, I call it.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:90%
And he reached out.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's just great
to be able to talk

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.389 align:middle line:84%
to like minded people who've
had a similar experience

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:90%
with these plant medicines.

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:39.976 align:middle line:84%
>> And how are you
using psilocybin now?

00:34:39.976 --> 00:34:42.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I micro dose.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
And so you asked earlier if
these symptoms come back.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I was too much in the
thinking mind this past week.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And so once I can recognize
my signs and symptoms, which

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:59.680 align:middle line:84%
three of the major ones are
over sleeping or under sleeping,

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:84%
loss of appetite, and I'm
not practicing self-care.

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.110 align:middle line:84%
And when I start
seeing that and I

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:84%
start seeing it more
and more, and I can't

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
use the mindfulness
and the other practices

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:84%
and I am eating right,
then I know that there's

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.230 align:middle line:90%
medicine that can help me.

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Then as you continue
to micro dose

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and continue to
introduce the medicine,

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
then there's absolutely
no way that I

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.880 align:middle line:90%
can be in my thinking mind.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not in
your thinking mind,

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.928 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have anxiety,
because you're not in the past

00:35:27.928 --> 00:35:29.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're not too
far in the future.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:90%
You're wholly in the moment.

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've been
experiencing since I've

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.080 align:middle line:90%
used that medicine again.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.970 align:middle line:84%
And usually, it lasts
for three months.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:37.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to add
here, too, the book,

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.910 align:middle line:84%
"How to Change Your Mind",
Michael Pollan did this book.

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And we talked a lot about this
when we first got connected.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.070 align:middle line:90%
It was through a mutual friend.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.852 align:middle line:84%
He understood we
had similar stories.

00:35:50.852 --> 00:35:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's where Daniel
and I really connected.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.812 align:middle line:84%
And Daniel's story is exactly
the What's Your Medicine.

00:35:55.812 --> 00:35:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Like he's finding his
medicines that help

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.730 align:middle line:84%
cure himself through
brain trauma.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.330 align:middle line:84%
But utilizing psychedelics
like psilocybin

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:09.100 align:middle line:84%
in a controlled powerful way
is what John Hopkins University

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:90%
is doing right now.

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a $17 million
in a grant in order

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:16.210 align:middle line:84%
for them to study
psychedelics, like psilocybin,

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.030 align:middle line:84%
in order for people
to understand

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:21.220 align:middle line:84%
that they can heal
themselves and allow the body

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:22.090 align:middle line:90%
to heal themselves.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And this plant medicine,
specifically psilocybin,

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:84%
has such a powerful
gift in order

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.280 align:middle line:84%
for it to allow you
to do that yourself.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I really
love that part of you.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And I love that you're
being a psychonaut

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.560 align:middle line:84%
in understanding this work
and doing the work yourself.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think that-- but
specifically adding

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.400 align:middle line:90%
in the science behind this.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I can tell
you something works

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:47.145 align:middle line:90%
and it's been great for me.

00:36:47.145 --> 00:36:49.200 align:middle line:84%
But if I can back
it up with science.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.840 align:middle line:90%
So I love your story, Daniel.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're really
stepping forward and doing

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:84%
the work and inspiring
so many others.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.620 align:middle line:90%
So thank you, buddy.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, brother.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:58.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, thank you.

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned the
default mode network.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And then even the Imperial
College of London and

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.840 align:middle line:90%
how these medicines work.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.370 align:middle line:90%
They work on our sense of self.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And specifically with the TBI
community, that sense of self

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.280 align:middle line:90%
is gone after injury.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:84%
So it can really help people
find themselves again and move

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.350 align:middle line:90%
into recovery.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:21.150 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, man.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.435 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for sharing
your story with us, Daniel.

00:37:24.435 --> 00:37:25.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:37:25.235 --> 00:37:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And we know that it's going
to be an inspiration for others

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.130 align:middle line:90%
with CTE.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:33.480 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully we'll get to stay
in touch with your progress

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.000 align:middle line:84%
and your health conditions
and your activism.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.130 align:middle line:90%
So keep the voice happening.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> No doubt.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate you
guys having me on.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
with us today, Daniel.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:43.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Daniel.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.560 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.700 align:middle line:90%
See you guys.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So he's one of your
medicine stories.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Love him.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is ideally what's
happening right now,

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:54.737 align:middle line:84%
too, is we're
understanding-- and when

00:37:54.737 --> 00:37:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I was a kid, didn't have
the internet, by the way.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:90%
So I just dated myself.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But we're faced with
an injury or a trauma.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.230 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand
stories that work.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.640 align:middle line:90%
People relate to stories.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.340 align:middle line:84%
People will relate to
Daniel in a certain way

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:84%
and want to try the
medicine that he's done.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so he is one of thousands of
stories that we'll be covering.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But he's exactly
one, especially one

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.790 align:middle line:84%
stepping forward and
being liked and being

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.100 align:middle line:90%
a mentor for other people.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.260 align:middle line:84%
So he's working with
other athletes that

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:27.493 align:middle line:84%
have had brain
trauma or concussions

00:38:27.493 --> 00:38:29.910 align:middle line:84%
and saying, hey, look, I know
your doctors are telling you

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.202 align:middle line:84%
we need to start taking these
prescription medications,

00:38:32.202 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:84%
but what if there
was another way?

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.010 align:middle line:90%
This is what I did.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.740 align:middle line:90%
This is what worked for me.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.478 align:middle line:84%
I'm not telling you
you need to do this.

00:38:38.478 --> 00:38:39.770 align:middle line:90%
But this is what worked for me.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So would you like to
try something else?

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what we want to do.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
That kid at 12 or 13 years old
that's faced with depression,

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, that's being bullied
or that's understanding,

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.820 align:middle line:84%
we've got cancer coming
up, what else can I do?

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.640 align:middle line:84%
I've seen the path of where
prescription medications

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and chemo and
everything else goes.

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.570 align:middle line:84%
What if there was
something else?

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've got
50% of Americans

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.430 align:middle line:84%
on some type of
prescription medications,

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.222 align:middle line:90%
over 150 million people.

00:39:07.222 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:84%
What if we could start
changing that percentage

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.082 align:middle line:90%
to go to some different form?

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:12.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying
all prescriptions bad.

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Some people need it.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:16.252 align:middle line:90%
But there are other ways.

00:39:16.252 --> 00:39:17.460 align:middle line:90%
There are other ways to heal.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.752 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we want to
do is that low hanging fruit

00:39:19.752 --> 00:39:22.620 align:middle line:84%
for that person to be, that
doesn't know about meditation,

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.240 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know about
Kambo, that doesn't

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.270 align:middle line:84%
know about plant-based
medicines to bring them

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.140 align:middle line:84%
into a different
field of healing.

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
premise behind this show.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And bringing light to
these amazing people,

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.595 align:middle line:84%
like Daniel, that are doing the
work and trying something new.

00:39:36.595 --> 00:39:37.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Important voices--

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Very important voices.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.360 align:middle line:90%
>> --in the world.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.610 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look
at Lane's first experience

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:90%
with something called Kambo.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Georgie.

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.954 align:middle line:90%
And my medicine is Kambo.

00:39:48.954 --> 00:39:50.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not psychedelic at all.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.390 align:middle line:90%
It's a purgative.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.080 align:middle line:84%
So you're literally cleaning
out your body energetically,

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.290 align:middle line:84%
spiritually, physically
on a cellular level.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.280 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're talking about
the energies of some people that

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.920 align:middle line:84%
might be around you,
even in business,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:84%
and just clearing that energy,
or if there's some entity

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that's just not feel like this
cord that's attached to me,

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.190 align:middle line:84%
sometimes I'm ready
to let that go.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Really remarkable things
happen to you from doing this.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:84%
The next say after Kambo, the
magic is just, things unfold,

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:84%
like maybe massive amounts
of abundance come your way,

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:29.775 align:middle line:84%
or something that's been lost
for a long time has found.

00:40:29.775 --> 00:40:32.440 align:middle line:90%


00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.730 align:middle line:90%
>> First time Kambo.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.730 align:middle line:90%
So a little bit nervous.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be OK.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:90%


00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.702 align:middle line:90%
>> So Lane, what is this?

00:40:45.702 --> 00:40:46.785 align:middle line:90%
Tell us what we're seeing.

00:40:46.785 --> 00:40:48.490 align:middle line:84%
>> By the way, I
was in the same of--

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.675 align:middle line:84%
someone's telling me about
frog medicine, Kambo.

00:40:50.675 --> 00:40:53.470 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what is that?

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started
doing my research,

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and understanding that tribal
people were using Kambo as,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:84%
it's a detoxification
for your body.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was to relieve a
Panema, which is a dark energy

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.440 align:middle line:90%
that sometimes people feel.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And when I understood that there
was these hunters and tribal

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.140 align:middle line:84%
people from the jungle that
were doing this before a hunt

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:84%
or before wanting
to go find a mate,

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.300 align:middle line:84%
or they were faced with some
illness with inside the body

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and they just needed
to get rid of it.

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:24.760 align:middle line:84%
So think of it as the greatest
detox that you can go through.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll walk you through
a few steps of this.

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:29.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's basically
consuming, let's say,

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:30.920 align:middle line:90%
a couple of liters of water.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.150 align:middle line:84%
You're drinking a lot of
water before this ceremony

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.350 align:middle line:90%
takes place.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And you'll take
the frog medicine.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And what I like to tell
people is like when you were

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.030 align:middle line:84%
a kid, when you were four
years old or five years old,

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.767 align:middle line:84%
and first remember that
flu or that sickness

00:41:45.767 --> 00:41:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that you just you're
like, oh, my god,

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.630 align:middle line:84%
I need to puke,
that's what this is.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:50.500 align:middle line:90%
And you purge.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And your body's basically
fighting off a toxin.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.990 align:middle line:84%
So all the organs in
your body are like,

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't know this
foreign substance

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to flush it out.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.240 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's happening
within your body.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the detoxification

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:03.690 align:middle line:90%
starts coming from.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:05.680 align:middle line:84%
So everything in your
body is fighting this off

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:06.888 align:middle line:90%
and wanting to purge it away.

00:42:06.888 --> 00:42:09.138 align:middle line:84%
And that's what ends up
happening is you have a purge,

00:42:09.138 --> 00:42:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and you end up puking a
lot of this water out,

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.050 align:middle line:84%
but also a lot of the toxins
and a lot of the bad energy,

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.360 align:middle line:84%
or the Panema, that's
inside of your body,

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.280 align:middle line:90%
you're letting that all go.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And you do, I would say not
directly after the ceremony,

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.100 align:middle line:84%
but that next day,
if you want to feel

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.110 align:middle line:84%
like the Superman or
the Super Woman feeling,

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.290 align:middle line:90%
you're like, oh, my gosh.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:30.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, there
is a higher level

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and you definitely feel
like you've let go of a lot.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And it is amazing what starts
happening in your life.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:37.610 align:middle line:90%
You start attracting.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was I was
able to let go of a business

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.810 align:middle line:90%
that I was no longer aligned to.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.960 align:middle line:84%
I was like-- and I felt it in
my core during that ceremony

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.220 align:middle line:90%
and I was able to let that go.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was a nice
emotional release

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:53.150 align:middle line:84%
that I don't need to be involved
with that person anymore.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.203 align:middle line:84%
And it was a great
understanding within my body.

00:42:55.203 --> 00:42:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Because my body was
telling me something

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:58.265 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't listening.

00:42:58.265 --> 00:42:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So once you're able
to let that all go,

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.890 align:middle line:84%
you've got a lot of
clarity after that.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's, by the way,
Kambo is a frog medicine.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a secretion of
a frog, by the way.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Nature is all around us.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.110 align:middle line:90%
Nature is healing us.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:14.352 align:middle line:84%
So to understand the
secretion of a tree frog

00:43:14.352 --> 00:43:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that's going to go
onto your skin to help

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.410 align:middle line:90%
detox your body blew me away.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.340 align:middle line:90%
I was like, this is too weird.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.610 align:middle line:84%
Until I experienced it for
myself and I was like, OK,

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:24.785 align:middle line:84%
And it's legal in
most countries.

00:43:24.785 --> 00:43:25.978 align:middle line:90%
That's the other thing.

00:43:25.978 --> 00:43:27.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't think the
government's really

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.930 align:middle line:90%
caught onto it that much.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And they're like,
who would really

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.390 align:middle line:84%
want to put themselves
through this?

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:32.880 align:middle line:90%
But it works.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's a powerful--
it's just another tool.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:36.670 align:middle line:90%
It's not the only tool.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.040 align:middle line:84%
It's just another tool out
there that people can go to.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:39.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.040 align:middle line:84%
So a part of your work
is about integration

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:45.040 align:middle line:84%
after someone has used plant
medicine, or maybe Kambo

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.030 align:middle line:84%
or what have you, to work
with the integration piece.

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:50.050 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm very big on integration.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:53.560 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have the circuitry
to sustain any experience

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.780 align:middle line:84%
that we're having, the
experience can actually

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:59.560 align:middle line:84%
work opposite of what we're
anticipating or hoping for.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It can create a dualistic
experience in life

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.570 align:middle line:84%
where all we want to do is go
back and do the medicine again

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and be in that world
instead of this one.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So the integration
piece is huge, as far

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.120 align:middle line:84%
as I'm concerned, as far as
long-term sustainable impact.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So tell us about what you're
doing to help people integrate

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.250 align:middle line:90%
these experiences.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.090 align:middle line:90%
That's the biggest part of this.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:24.010 align:middle line:84%
So even after, let's
say, an Ayahuasca

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.620 align:middle line:84%
ceremony or a
psilocybin experience,

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.560 align:middle line:84%
people that are
working with Aya Flow,

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.650 align:middle line:84%
it's we have this
experience, but I typically

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.310 align:middle line:84%
like to have
accountability buddies.

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:37.040 align:middle line:84%
So you team up with somebody and
you're accountable to someone

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:37.840 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So if I have this
experience that

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.980 align:middle line:84%
says I need to stop drinking and
I know I need to stop drinking,

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.830 align:middle line:84%
or I need to stop smoking,
what are the steps

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.083 align:middle line:84%
that you're actually
taking to get there?

00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So how are you actually
changing your patterns

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.208 align:middle line:90%
and your behavior?

00:44:50.208 --> 00:44:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have to be
accountable to somebody.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Because if when you're
accountable to yourself,

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.510 align:middle line:84%
it's easy to be like,
yeah, you know what,

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:84%
maybe I'll just
have this one drink,

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:01.090 align:middle line:84%
even though my ceremony or the
insight in my Kambo ceremony

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:03.310 align:middle line:84%
was that I need to
stop doing this.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.200 align:middle line:84%
You can cheat on
yourself very easily.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you're accountable
to somebody else,

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:09.520 align:middle line:90%
it's a lot harder to be--

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.660 align:middle line:90%
you want to be truthful.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.967 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, the
biggest part of this

00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:15.550 align:middle line:84%
is like the ceremony
is the easy part.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.740 align:middle line:84%
The integration, how you're
applying this knowledge

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.150 align:middle line:90%
to your life, is the big part.

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.587 align:middle line:84%
So it's how you
show up now to life,

00:45:21.587 --> 00:45:23.170 align:middle line:84%
how you show up to
this integration is

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:25.220 align:middle line:84%
how you're going to show
up to everything in life.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.240 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I tell people.

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.560 align:middle line:90%
It's like, this is your journey.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to really heal?

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:29.847 align:middle line:84%
Do you really want
to do the work?

00:45:29.847 --> 00:45:30.860 align:middle line:90%
Then do it.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, be accountable
to yourself and others.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this talk therapy
that you engage in, then,

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.520 align:middle line:84%
helping them to develop
a plan or to glean from

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:42.525 align:middle line:84%
the experiences that they're
having during these ceremonies

00:45:42.525 --> 00:45:45.590 align:middle line:84%
to translate it into, OK, what's
this mean that I'm supposed

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:46.390 align:middle line:90%
to do?

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:49.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Typically, people will
get some type of insight.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.720 align:middle line:84%
It could be two or three things,
let's say, for an Ayahuasca

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.210 align:middle line:90%
or from a psilocybin experience.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have them
write that down.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.850 align:middle line:90%
What is it that you need to do?

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.378 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
you need to change?

00:46:00.378 --> 00:46:02.170 align:middle line:84%
Typically everybody
has something that they

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:90%
need to change in their life.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.590 align:middle line:90%
And yes, then it's a plan.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.840 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to get there?

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And we think of
three foot tosses.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so in this
experience, it says

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that I need to change my
jobs and move to New York.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, that's not
going to happen overnight.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.250 align:middle line:84%
What are the three foot tosses
in order for you to get there?

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:24.070 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, first of all,
I'm going to have to have

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:25.910 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with my manager.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:26.710 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:27.730 align:middle line:90%
When are we going to do that?

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.105 align:middle line:84%
OK, that's going
to be next week.

00:46:29.105 --> 00:46:30.220 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.890 align:middle line:84%
OK, next I'm going to have to
go research places in New York.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.430 align:middle line:90%
OK, great.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:35.180 align:middle line:84%
When is that research
going to take place?

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it's a
sequential step by step.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And we think of it a
logical place to do it.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And when I say three
foot toss, it's

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.290 align:middle line:90%
like it has to be obtainable.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.968 align:middle line:84%
It has to be a plan
that's obtainable.

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's
going to be too much.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like someone
who's never worked out

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.740 align:middle line:84%
in their entire life, like, I'm
going to workout for two hours

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.690 align:middle line:84%
every single day
for the next week.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:53.630 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not.

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:55.840 align:middle line:84%
If you've never done
it in your life,

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.560 align:middle line:84%
why don't you commit to
one minute one day a week?

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.900 align:middle line:90%
That's obtainable.

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, when you'll get
in there for that one minute

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.280 align:middle line:84%
you commit to yourself,
you'll probably do 30 minutes.

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:11.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's when I-- and so we
make a plan, an actionable plan

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to
do, that you can follow.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.120 align:middle line:84%
And I help them coach
along on that path

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.670 align:middle line:84%
to make it obtainable, so that
they're not setting themselves

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.140 align:middle line:90%
up for disaster.

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very good.

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:24.320 align:middle line:84%
Giving the subconscious
evidence that I can, yes, I can.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I can.

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:26.230 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I can.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.980 align:middle line:90%
You can do this.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:29.132 align:middle line:10%
And then that's part
of the accountability,

00:47:29.132 --> 00:47:32.170 align:middle line:10%
too, is when you're having these
struggles, you haven't quite

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.005 align:middle line:10%
met your benchmark for that
week or for that month,

00:47:36.005 --> 00:47:38.380 align:middle line:10%
your accountability buddy is
there for you to understand,

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.410 align:middle line:10%
OK, things come up.

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.390 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Move on.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.850 align:middle line:84%
We didn't quite
meet that benchmark,

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.740 align:middle line:84%
but you're going
to do it this week.

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.290 align:middle line:90%
Make it happen.

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's a big part
of this is you have

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.780 align:middle line:90%
to be accountable to somebody.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Where can people go to
find more of your What's Your

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:53.680 align:middle line:90%
Medicine stories?

00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so we have
whatsyourmedicine.org.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:57.490 align:middle line:10%
They can go online and
check it out over there.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:59.032 align:middle line:10%
And we'll have a
link to our YouTube,

00:47:59.032 --> 00:48:00.907 align:middle line:10%
where we have plenty
other stories of people,

00:48:00.907 --> 00:48:02.110 align:middle line:10%
different people's journeys.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:03.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Lane, thank you for
the work that you do.

00:48:03.943 --> 00:48:07.450 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a new generation
of how to look at medicine

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and how we need to approach
taking care of ourselves

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:11.890 align:middle line:90%
and finding our true path.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:16.720 align:middle line:84%
It's been a great joy having you
bring all these amazing stories

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.540 align:middle line:90%
to us today.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:18.550 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for being here.

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:18.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:19.480 align:middle line:90%
It was my honor.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.940 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.380 align:middle line:10%
I think that this
information will

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.560 align:middle line:10%
spark many to have an open
mind about what is possible

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:30.790 align:middle line:10%
and urge them to ask themselves,
what's your medicine?

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:31.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm Dr. Sue Morter.

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
"Healing Matrix."

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.000 align:middle line:90%
