[ Music ]

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.803 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: James I'm so happy
you could join me [chuckle] here

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:37.771 align:middle line:90%
in Sedona.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.039 align:middle line:90%
There's been a lot going on.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.075 align:middle line:84%
We're in a really potent
period of time and Sedona seems

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.911 align:middle line:84%
to be the hot spot on the
planet at this moment.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.713 align:middle line:84%
And we will get into
that in a little bit

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.716 align:middle line:84%
but first let's let
our viewers get

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.318 align:middle line:90%
to know you a little bit better.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.720 align:middle line:90%
And you're a geologist.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.723 align:middle line:84%
[Inaudible] you've been all over
the world in strange situations.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:58.158 align:middle line:90%
You've lived in Brazil.

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You've been into
crystals from a youth

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.496 align:middle line:90%
in Arkansas your entire life.

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:07.367 align:middle line:84%
And so you understand the earth,
its minerals, gemstones, energy,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:09.603 align:middle line:90%
lay lines, sacred spaces.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.905 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk about
a bit off all of it today.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.407 align:middle line:84%
So first give us an
idea of how you got

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.642 align:middle line:90%
onto your spiritual path.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.145 align:middle line:84%
You were raised in a Baptist
community in Arkansas.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:18.979 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.313 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes, thank you Regina.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.849 align:middle line:84%
And first let me thank you
for the opportunity to be here

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:27.020 align:middle line:84%
and it's lovely to speak
with you and meet you.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.089 align:middle line:90%
But yes, I grew up in the --

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:33.793 align:middle line:84%
in Arkansas which happens to
be the largest singular deposit

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.296 align:middle line:90%
of quartz crystal on the planet.

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:42.235 align:middle line:84%
And I always had a fascination
for rocks, and for minerals

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:46.907 align:middle line:84%
and basically lived in
a cornucopia of quartz.

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.842 align:middle line:84%
My father was with
the University

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.610 align:middle line:90%
of Arkansas Law School.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.546 align:middle line:90%
He was an avid outdoorsman.

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:84%
He was a fisherman and
we would go to some

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.018 align:middle line:84%
of the lakes near our
home that happened

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.353 align:middle line:90%
to sit atop crystal beds.

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
He would fish and I would
drive for quartz crystal...

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And they were
just loose on the bottom?

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.293 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Absolutely.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Even points
and stuff...

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.427 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Small shards.

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:09.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Little
chunks and shards.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:09.829 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Points, absolutely.

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:10.397 align:middle line:90%
Perfect points.

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:10.831 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:11.965 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.367 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And extremely
clear and you could --

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.237 align:middle line:84%
I could literally fill up a
coffee can of them in a couple

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.471 align:middle line:90%
of hours in the summer.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:19.639 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh how fun.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.274 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And the water
was crystal clear.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:24.677 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we went to a place
called Crystal Springs near Hot

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.847 align:middle line:84%
Springs National Park
on Lake Washtenaw.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.584 align:middle line:90%
So it's a very special place.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:35.388 align:middle line:84%
And after I -- and I grew up
in Arkansas, stayed in energy

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:40.393 align:middle line:84%
and after I finished
university and started working

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.995 align:middle line:90%
as a geological engineer...

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.798 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: No surprise you were
a geologist after your passion

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:46.099 align:middle line:90%
for crystals and rocks and...

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.235 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Well I had always
been absolutely fascinated

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:49.970 align:middle line:90%
with every aspect of the earth.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.674 align:middle line:84%
There's some amazing
geological anomalies in Arkansas

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.411 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't truly appreciate
until after I left there.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:02.916 align:middle line:84%
But after I finished school
I moved to Canada and worked

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:03.984 align:middle line:90%
for about six months

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.119 align:middle line:84%
and absolutely fell
in love with Canada.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.089 align:middle line:84%
Brilliant, beautiful,
crisp energy.

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.659 align:middle line:84%
And then I was then given
the offer to move to Brazil

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.663 align:middle line:84%
and it was a difficult choice
because I'm a bit of a musician

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:19.799 align:middle line:84%
as well, and I had got in
with a band while I was

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.569 align:middle line:90%
in Calgary, Alberta.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.539 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't turn the
opportunity to go to Brazil.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:32.778 align:middle line:84%
So I soon found myself in
the other largest deposit

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:36.249 align:middle line:84%
of quartz crystal on the
planet and that's Brazil.

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.320 align:middle line:90%
And Brazil is an amazing place.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You see now
most people would not think

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:46.559 align:middle line:84%
that the Arkansas deposits
would hold a candle to Brazil

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.895 align:middle line:84%
because when you go to gem
and mineral shows its Brazil,

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.730 align:middle line:84%
Brazil, Brazilian
crystals everywhere.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.033 align:middle line:90%
But not so?

00:03:53.033 --> 00:03:55.568 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Well the largest
singular deposit of quartz

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.672 align:middle line:84%
on the planet starts at
about Little Rock, Arkansas

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:00.507 align:middle line:84%
and goes all the way
over to Oklahoma.

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:03.443 align:middle line:90%
It extends about 177 miles.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:05.879 align:middle line:90%
It's 35 miles wide.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.114 align:middle line:90%
It is the largest...

00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:09.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Single.

00:04:09.316 --> 00:04:12.185 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...singular
unbroken deposit of quartz

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.987 align:middle line:90%
on the planet, in the world.

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:18.458 align:middle line:84%
Now Brazil in the state of
[inaudible] and the state

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:23.296 align:middle line:84%
of [inaudible] -- and I lived
in both, have a larger quantity

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:28.234 align:middle line:84%
of quartz but none of
the deposits that are --

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:31.271 align:middle line:84%
none of the singular deposits
are as large as the one

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.408 align:middle line:84%
in Arkansas, but Brazil
is the largest miner.

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:36.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:39.145 align:middle line:90%
>> James: The largest producer

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:42.781 align:middle line:84%
and has the largest total
reservoirs of course.

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.185 align:middle line:84%
But Arkansas is the
largest singular...

00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:45.618 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Single.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:46.453 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.554 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...unbroken deposit.

00:04:47.554 --> 00:04:48.688 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well thank
you for clarifying.

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:50.623 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And there's
significance for that

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.826 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that if
you consider that,

00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:54.861 align:middle line:90%
in terms of earth energies.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:59.933 align:middle line:84%
If you consider that
quartz is piezoelectric

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:05.605 align:middle line:84%
and by piezoelectric it has
some considerable attributes.

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:08.341 align:middle line:90%
It produces a radio wave.

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.144 align:middle line:84%
When mechanical pressure
is applied

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:15.181 align:middle line:84%
to quartz it actually
produces an electrical charge.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:22.322 align:middle line:84%
You may be familiar; on January
1, 2011 there was a topic all

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:26.693 align:middle line:84%
over the national news for a
few days that a great quantity

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.828 align:middle line:84%
of blackbirds fell out
of the sky in Arkansas.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, I
do remember that.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.333 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And there
was this great mystery.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.601 align:middle line:90%
And I thought to myself --

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:37.337 align:middle line:84%
I was watching it as a
geologist -- what's the mystery?

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.906 align:middle line:84%
I see this all the time
growing up in Arkansas.

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:41.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Well, what is it?

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.276 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Oh because you'd
have new Madrid fault,

00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:46.713 align:middle line:84%
and not that other geologists
would necessarily recognize this

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:50.450 align:middle line:84%
but you have the well know new
Madrid fault line that comes

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:90%
into Arkansas and during 2010,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.856 align:middle line:84%
in fact at our 10/10/10
gathering there were earthquakes

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.825 align:middle line:90%
all around the area we were.

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:03.696 align:middle line:84%
And you had a series of earth
quakes before four and five

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:09.068 align:middle line:84%
on the Richter scale
putting mechanical pressure

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:13.073 align:middle line:84%
against the largest single
deposit of quartz on the planet.

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:16.409 align:middle line:84%
So when that mechanical
pressure builds up it's going

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.346 align:middle line:84%
to produce an electrical
shock wave.

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:24.083 align:middle line:84%
Black birds, particularly the
type that fell migrate according

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:27.954 align:middle line:84%
to ultraviolet sensors
just as modern butterflies.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:32.325 align:middle line:84%
And so it's my theory that the
piezoelectric wave temporarily

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:35.962 align:middle line:84%
stunned them and that they
feel from the sky and died

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:41.201 align:middle line:84%
by blunt trauma to the
ground, and because I saw

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:45.038 align:middle line:84%
that happening every
year or so growing up.

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:47.874 align:middle line:84%
Not in that great number
but that sort of thing.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But there was a
particularly large amount

00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:52.278 align:middle line:84%
of activity going on
at that exact time.

00:06:52.278 --> 00:06:53.546 align:middle line:84%
>> James: At that time
because of the earthquakes.

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right, right.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.548 align:middle line:90%
Right. Adjusting.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:57.951 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And so you
know the point being

00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:03.189 align:middle line:84%
that Arkansas has a third
of the state if not more

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.961 align:middle line:84%
with this enormous active
energy of quartz crystal

00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:12.265 align:middle line:84%
and quarts is an absolutely
phenomenal mineral.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:16.569 align:middle line:84%
It produces electricity, it's a
receiver, it is a transmitter.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:23.176 align:middle line:84%
It has a vibration that Marcel
Vogel pointed out as very,

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:28.481 align:middle line:84%
very closely attuned
to the human vibration.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:32.418 align:middle line:84%
And so it -- growing up
there it had an effect on me

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:36.789 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't recognize until I
moved to Brazil and met my wife.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:39.692 align:middle line:84%
And by that time I was
already a rock hound.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:40.894 align:middle line:90%
I mean as a young man

00:07:40.894 --> 00:07:45.899 align:middle line:84%
in Arkansas I would just
find rocks and keep them.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:48.968 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got to
Brazil I had a house full

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.237 align:middle line:90%
of minerals from everywhere.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:57.377 align:middle line:84%
And Brazil is the absolutely
cornucopia of crystals,

00:07:57.377 --> 00:08:00.313 align:middle line:84%
semi-precious, and
precious gem stones.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.315 align:middle line:90%
Between the states of Biea,

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:07.487 align:middle line:84%
Sira and Minas Gerais
almost every precious

00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:12.058 align:middle line:84%
and semi-precious mineral
and gem on the planet exists.

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:16.229 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got there I found
myself working as a geologist.

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:84%
The unique position of receiving
30% of my salary by a decree

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.740 align:middle line:84%
that occurred after I had
been there for about a year

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.245 align:middle line:84%
in a local currency that's
devalued at 400% per year.

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:36.482 align:middle line:84%
When I arrived in Brazil six
[foreign word] made one dollar.

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:41.387 align:middle line:84%
When I left six and a half years
later 24,000 [foreign word] made

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:41.955 align:middle line:90%
one dollar.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:43.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:43.723 align:middle line:84%
>> James: So you know
you do the math...

00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:44.157 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It happens.

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.158 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:45.858 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...you
cannot take that money

00:08:45.858 --> 00:08:46.659 align:middle line:90%
and put it in the bank.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:50.163 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And so I did what
all the other Brazilians do.

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:53.466 align:middle line:84%
They bought gemstones,
gold or property.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.235 align:middle line:90%
I bought gemstones.

00:08:55.235 --> 00:09:00.273 align:middle line:84%
And at that time virtually
every Brazilian person

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:02.508 align:middle line:84%
of substance was
a gemstone dealer.

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:09.282 align:middle line:84%
So my landlord in my apartment
started coming to my apartment

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:12.652 align:middle line:84%
and would bring in his little
box of gems and we'd take

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
that 30% of my salary
and buy gems with it.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:23.129 align:middle line:84%
And coincidentally I had just
read Edgar Cases' biography

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:26.933 align:middle line:84%
There is a River  by Thomas
Sugar [assumed spelling].

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle line:84%
And I had -- and I
tell people that I went

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.872 align:middle line:84%
to Brazil a born again Baptist,
and the minute that I read

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:38.244 align:middle line:84%
that book I had that eureka
moment that I had never had

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:42.815 align:middle line:84%
in the Baptist church so to
speak where I understood --

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:48.488 align:middle line:84%
he talked in a wider
perspective of reincarnation,

00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:51.357 align:middle line:84%
about the laws of
cause and effect.

00:09:51.357 --> 00:10:00.433 align:middle line:84%
And that book beautifully
describes the transition

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:05.905 align:middle line:84%
of a religious Christian
into a wider horizons...

00:10:05.905 --> 00:10:07.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because he had to go
through that journey himself.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.175 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Through the
difficulties himself.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.912 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Of trying to make sure
that he wasn't suddenly going

00:10:12.912 --> 00:10:13.946 align:middle line:90%
against something that had been

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.916 align:middle line:84%
so deeply programed
since childhood.

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was on the banks of
the Amazon River, literally,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.856 align:middle line:84%
and read that book straight
through and then again.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:25.958 align:middle line:90%
I was walking on clouds for days

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:30.963 align:middle line:84%
because I'd finally found a
truth that truly resonated and,

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:36.169 align:middle line:84%
you know, the limitations of the
biblical, literal translation

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Bible left gaps in
my intellectual searching's

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.874 align:middle line:90%
and so this filled them.

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:43.876 align:middle line:90%
And so at this point I start --

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:47.246 align:middle line:84%
I was reading everything by
Casey I could get my hands on.

00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:48.848 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't particularly interested

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:52.051 align:middle line:84%
in watching Brazilian
television at that time.

00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:54.921 align:middle line:84%
And I spend a lot of
time in remote locations

00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:59.792 align:middle line:84%
so I started reading
Casey speaking

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
about the healing properties
and attributes of gem stones.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.467 align:middle line:90%
And it was just a cosmic wake.

00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:13.439 align:middle line:84%
I had Jose Luis with mounds
-- I had a table of, you know,

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:17.710 align:middle line:84%
six foot in diameter and I had
a round table in our dining room

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.546 align:middle line:84%
and he would literally
fill it with aquamarines,

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.015 align:middle line:90%
I mean mounds of Emeralds.

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:24.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:25.918 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Aquamarines,
amethysts, opal.

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:30.022 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't realize
that Brazil produces as much

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.592 align:middle line:84%
if not more opal
than Australia does.

00:11:32.592 --> 00:11:34.861 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly it
was all Australians

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:38.097 align:middle line:84%
that owned all the mines in
Sira, Brazil when I was there.

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:40.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was part of
expatriate community

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.638 align:middle line:84%
and so I became fascinated with
these stones and I was reading

00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:46.973 align:middle line:90%
about them at the same time

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:50.576 align:middle line:84%
through the Edgar Casey
Circular files and a few books

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.545 align:middle line:84%
that had been written
from his readings.

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:55.548 align:middle line:84%
And Casey spent an
incredible amount

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:58.885 align:middle line:84%
of time recommending
gemstones for people

00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:00.286 align:middle line:90%
in their life readings.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.355 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Wasn't there a
specific book that was written

00:12:02.355 --> 00:12:04.056 align:middle line:84%
that dealt quite
a bit with that?

00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:08.761 align:middle line:84%
>> James: By third parties, not
by you know -- not directly --

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:14.634 align:middle line:84%
the ARE originally produced a
few books back in the '70s...

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:15.968 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.737 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...when I was reading
these that were just sort

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.472 align:middle line:90%
of compilations, were --

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:25.945 align:middle line:84%
that had editors as opposed to
writers and there is a female.

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:29.015 align:middle line:84%
I -- her name escapes
me at the moment.

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:32.318 align:middle line:84%
That has recently become
very active in the ARE

00:12:32.318 --> 00:12:36.088 align:middle line:84%
and has written two books
about Casey's readings

00:12:36.088 --> 00:12:38.391 align:middle line:84%
on gemstones with
interpretations.

00:12:38.391 --> 00:12:40.092 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so we'll
have to go do a little search

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:42.228 align:middle line:84%
on that however you're
writing your own book too.

00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:45.464 align:middle line:84%
>> James: I am and
I am approaching it

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.366 align:middle line:84%
from a little bit
different perspective

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:53.005 align:middle line:84%
and so I hope this -- this
is truly a passion for me

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:54.440 align:middle line:90%
and the writing comes easy.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.142 align:middle line:90%
But I am adding an element

00:12:56.142 --> 00:13:01.247 align:middle line:84%
that I don't think has been
taken before on gemstones

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:05.318 align:middle line:84%
and that I take in the geometry
of their molecular structure.

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:06.319 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah,
that's interesting

00:13:06.319 --> 00:13:08.621 align:middle line:84%
because there are
books on gemstones

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.123 align:middle line:84%
and their consciousness
properties and affiliations

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:14.126 align:middle line:84%
with scales of color,
tone, etcetera.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:15.328 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Right.

00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:16.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But no one's
done that that I know of.

00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:19.131 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Well what I'm doing
is taking their hardness,

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.767 align:middle line:84%
the most scale of
hardness and using

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:27.173 align:middle line:84%
that to determine the reach
of their energy fields.

00:13:27.173 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:84%
I think the more dense, the more
compacted they are determines

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle line:84%
to a large degree how much
of a field they cover.

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:43.890 align:middle line:84%
Now Edgar Casey spoke about gems
essentially being tuning forks.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.327 align:middle line:84%
I talk about them being
energies that are libraries

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:55.067 align:middle line:84%
of incredible light
and electricity.

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:59.639 align:middle line:84%
There are more for example
electrons crammed into a diamond

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.074 align:middle line:84%
than any other substance
on earth.

00:14:02.074 --> 00:14:05.711 align:middle line:84%
And I think it is
the circulation

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:09.415 align:middle line:84%
of the molecular structure
but also the patterning.

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:13.819 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is familiar with
the five platonic solids.

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:16.188 align:middle line:90%
And I believe that each

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:22.728 align:middle line:84%
of the five Platonic solids is
a sacred code that helps us open

00:14:22.728 --> 00:14:24.764 align:middle line:90%
up into our spirituality.

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:30.069 align:middle line:84%
Metatron speaks about the
universe being a fabric

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:32.805 align:middle line:90%
of sacred geometry.

00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:36.375 align:middle line:84%
Our very molecular structure
in our human bodies...

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:37.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:14:37.143 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...is geometric.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.779 align:middle line:84%
Every molecule, every
atom is geometric.

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:43.082 align:middle line:84%
Every molecule, every
atom is geometric.

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.885 align:middle line:84%
And most of the -- there
are only seven crystalline

00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:49.956 align:middle line:84%
structures that occur in all
crystals and in all gemstones.

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:55.161 align:middle line:84%
And all seven of these are
either a direct Platonic solid

00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:58.431 align:middle line:84%
or a derivative of
platonic solid

00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.334 align:middle line:84%
and I think it is the
geometrical pattern

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:05.972 align:middle line:84%
that also influences how
we wear the gemstones,

00:15:05.972 --> 00:15:09.742 align:middle line:84%
where we wear the gemstones,
when we wear the gemstones,

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.446 align:middle line:84%
and the properties
that they convey to us.

00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:15.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now okay, let
me ask you a question.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.049 align:middle line:84%
You brought up Metatron
a moment ago.

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:20.119 align:middle line:84%
You've also gotten a lot of
information from Metatron,

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:23.622 align:middle line:84%
as well as certainly the
myriad of Casey readings...

00:15:23.622 --> 00:15:24.457 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes.

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:25.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...over the years.

00:15:25.725 --> 00:15:27.460 align:middle line:84%
So let's back up for just
a sec because we're going

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.495 align:middle line:84%
to groom this story and
bring it all together

00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:32.364 align:middle line:84%
about the exact healing
properties of stones.

00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:36.268 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did Metatron come
into your experience in life?

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.604 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Well that's
an interesting question,

00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:43.009 align:middle line:84%
and I became extremely
metaphysical

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:45.745 align:middle line:90%
when I was living in Brazil.

00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:50.783 align:middle line:84%
And for the next 20
years I literally lived

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:55.388 align:middle line:84%
in third world countries
that were not English

00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:59.058 align:middle line:84%
and so I had the opportunity
to learn how to speak four

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:00.459 align:middle line:90%
or five other languages.

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:03.429 align:middle line:84%
I speak French, Portuguese,
Spanish and a bit of Russian

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.798 align:middle line:84%
and I learned them
because I had to.

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.533 align:middle line:90%
I was there and I had no choice.

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:10.603 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way you
really learn a language.

00:16:10.603 --> 00:16:13.506 align:middle line:84%
But language -- in an
interesting way my --

00:16:13.506 --> 00:16:16.876 align:middle line:84%
I tell people that my life
makes more sense in retrospect

00:16:16.876 --> 00:16:18.778 align:middle line:84%
than it did when I
was going through it.

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:21.213 align:middle line:84%
I often thought that I was
on the wrong path and needed

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:23.749 align:middle line:84%
to quite everything and go
join an Ashram in India.

00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:26.986 align:middle line:84%
And had I had done that I would
not have had the experiences

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:32.525 align:middle line:84%
that I have now that allow
me to teach what I teach now.

00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:41.467 align:middle line:84%
But I began channeling in a
sense the last three years

00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:45.237 align:middle line:84%
that I was in Brazil in the
sense that I had a spirit guide

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:49.942 align:middle line:84%
that was coming in and it was
an interesting phase in my life

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:54.213 align:middle line:84%
because to a certain
degree we were isolated.

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:56.248 align:middle line:90%
I was speaking Portuguese

00:16:56.248 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:84%
but I was having an incredible
metaphysical awakening

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:02.154 align:middle line:84%
and I was -- I had
the opportunity

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:04.422 align:middle line:90%
to go visit sacred places.

00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:07.993 align:middle line:84%
I went to the Amazon River, I
went to the Andes Mountains.

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:12.264 align:middle line:84%
I worked two weeks on and two
weeks off, so my two weeks

00:17:12.264 --> 00:17:15.066 align:middle line:84%
on were very often
in incredible places,

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:19.238 align:middle line:84%
and my two weeks off were
pretty much devoted to study.

00:17:19.238 --> 00:17:23.642 align:middle line:84%
But they were also in amazing
energies and so at the same time

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:25.076 align:middle line:90%
that I was studying gemstones

00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:28.347 align:middle line:84%
and experiencing their energy
I was studying the energy

00:17:28.347 --> 00:17:31.951 align:middle line:84%
of sacred sites and trying
to learn about these.

00:17:31.951 --> 00:17:34.854 align:middle line:84%
And so I had a spirit
guide that came in and I --

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:37.156 align:middle line:90%
my pineal gland began to open

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:40.126 align:middle line:84%
and I would see in
the etheric realm.

00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:42.461 align:middle line:84%
It was a bit frightening
at first and then I began

00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:44.764 align:middle line:90%
to understand it better.

00:17:44.764 --> 00:17:48.767 align:middle line:84%
But we would see -- and I speak
we, Ann my wife was with me

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:52.104 align:middle line:84%
at the time -- we
would often see members

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:53.806 align:middle line:90%
of the [inaudible] Kingdom

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:58.544 align:middle line:84%
and not always know exactly
how to interpret them.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:02.548 align:middle line:84%
And so after Brazil --
just to jump ahead to get

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.183 align:middle line:84%
to Metatron -- we
moved to Africa.

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.719 align:middle line:84%
We lived in Africa
for six years.

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:09.188 align:middle line:84%
We went through three
Ku Di Ta's, were rescued

00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:13.592 align:middle line:84%
by the French Foreign
Legion, then had a variety

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:19.331 align:middle line:84%
of experiences that taught
us the depths of fear

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:23.302 align:middle line:84%
and taught me -- brought
me into my other area

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:27.973 align:middle line:84%
that I consider a life lesson
that I now teach and that's how

00:18:27.973 --> 00:18:31.243 align:middle line:90%
to deal with psychic attack.

00:18:31.243 --> 00:18:34.647 align:middle line:84%
How to deal, how to
maintain our integrity.

00:18:34.647 --> 00:18:37.082 align:middle line:84%
Because during the times
that we were in Brazil

00:18:37.082 --> 00:18:39.718 align:middle line:84%
and in Africa we dealt
first hand with people

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:40.686 align:middle line:90%
that were Voo Doo practitioners.

00:18:40.686 --> 00:18:41.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, witch doctors.

00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:43.189 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:18:43.189 --> 00:18:46.825 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Animism is the big
thing in Africa and so we sort

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:49.295 align:middle line:84%
of had an on the job
training of how that worked

00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:52.965 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time we were
channeling and getting told what

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:56.335 align:middle line:84%
to do and this employed
the gemstones.

00:18:56.335 --> 00:19:00.773 align:middle line:84%
And so I had knowledge
of exactly how

00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:04.276 align:middle line:84%
to keep the aura intact and
how the gemstones helped

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:05.544 align:middle line:90%
in that process.

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:07.513 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Did you start
noticing immediate effects once

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.481 align:middle line:84%
you started implementing
the information?

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.651 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And I started noticing
the absolute effects both

00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:14.620 align:middle line:84%
when it worked and
when it didn't.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.356 align:middle line:84%
And when an attack
would be launched on us,

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:23.262 align:middle line:84%
very often from idea -- from
locations that we weren't aware

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:26.899 align:middle line:90%
of and it would devastate you.

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.701 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because you weren't
necessarily a welcome guest

00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:30.502 align:middle line:84%
at all times among
these cultures.

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.739 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Well and very
often the people that --

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:36.442 align:middle line:84%
the source of the attack might
not come from where you think.

00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.346 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And there are
people that are energy takers

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:43.849 align:middle line:84%
that may be among your
list of acquaintances.

00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:44.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:45.651 align:middle line:90%
>> James: And there are people

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:47.453 align:middle line:84%
that are unconscious
energy takers.

00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:51.991 align:middle line:84%
People that are medically
depressed become energy takers.

00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:54.093 align:middle line:90%
People that are control freaks

00:19:54.093 --> 00:19:57.763 align:middle line:84%
and that's usually
where it comes from.

00:19:57.763 --> 00:19:59.732 align:middle line:90%
Attached to your solar plexus.

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.434 align:middle line:84%
And I learned this through
the Carlos Castaneda books;

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.937 align:middle line:84%
exactly the mechanics
of how it works.

00:20:04.937 --> 00:20:08.007 align:middle line:84%
So people that dominate,
people that are trying

00:20:08.007 --> 00:20:12.678 align:middle line:84%
to sell you something, people
that are authoritarian figures.

00:20:12.678 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
But also people who are
manically depressed.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.783 align:middle line:84%
People who are imbalanced
are going to take energy.

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:20.853 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to learn
from the ground up how

00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:25.124 align:middle line:84%
to protect the energy
field and how

00:20:25.124 --> 00:20:28.160 align:middle line:84%
to prevent attachments
of thought forms.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.964 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that often
happens in auric integrity is

00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:35.634 align:middle line:84%
that is your own though
forms coming back to roost

00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:90%
that will attach to your field.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.874 align:middle line:84%
If you are a person that gets
into major conflicts a lot,

00:20:41.874 --> 00:20:44.476 align:middle line:84%
even if you're right
and you put out a lot

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:47.046 align:middle line:84%
of emotional negative
energy that thought is going

00:20:47.046 --> 00:20:49.949 align:middle line:84%
to go somewhere and can
become like a Ping-Pong bang.

00:20:49.949 --> 00:20:54.353 align:middle line:84%
But that large thought form
will eventually come back home

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:58.691 align:middle line:84%
and you have to deal with it
and so there's a whole science

00:20:58.691 --> 00:21:04.563 align:middle line:84%
to auric integrity
that employs gemstones.

00:21:04.563 --> 00:21:09.134 align:middle line:84%
And also speaks a bit
about what can happen

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:12.171 align:middle line:84%
at the differing
energies at sacred sites.

00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:15.374 align:middle line:84%
You can go to certain sacred
sites that are so powerful

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:20.045 align:middle line:84%
like Sedona that if this is
not your normal energy to be

00:21:20.045 --> 00:21:24.717 align:middle line:84%
in it can create an auric
implosion after a few days.

00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:27.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Everybody who
lives here understands

00:21:27.086 --> 00:21:30.756 align:middle line:84%
if you're not suited to it, it
will as they say, chew you up

00:21:30.756 --> 00:21:32.391 align:middle line:90%
and spit you out really fast.

00:21:32.391 --> 00:21:35.461 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And then same
thing can happen in places

00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:37.963 align:middle line:84%
like Arkansas where you have
enormous crystal fields.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:41.800 align:middle line:84%
If you're someone who works
around crystals a lot,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.237 align:middle line:84%
you have a certain amount of
time to develop an auric sheath.

00:21:45.237 --> 00:21:46.438 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:48.007 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And if you
develop that sheath you have

00:21:48.007 --> 00:21:50.709 align:middle line:84%
to also make sure that
you stay in balance.

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:53.812 align:middle line:84%
If you don't develop that sheath
you're going to bleed energy

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:56.782 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to have
arc short circuitry.

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.984 align:middle line:90%
You can become eccentric.

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.986 align:middle line:84%
You're going to lose
your balance.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:05.858 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people that
come here loft so high

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:07.693 align:middle line:84%
without remembering to keep
their feet on the ground.

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:08.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You mean
here in Sedona or...

00:22:08.761 --> 00:22:09.528 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Sedona.

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:10.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...yes indeed.

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.096 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Sedona or Arkansas.

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:12.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>> James: You need a high
area -- high energy area.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.368 align:middle line:90%
And Arkansas is a unique energy.

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:17.436 align:middle line:90%
It's almost totally quartz

00:22:17.436 --> 00:22:18.771 align:middle line:84%
so it's a little bit
different than here.

00:22:18.771 --> 00:22:20.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Hmm-mm.

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:24.376 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And so there's a
lot of tie ins to power nodes

00:22:24.376 --> 00:22:28.714 align:middle line:84%
as to auric maintenance
and the use of gemstones.

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:30.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: let's just briefly go
back to Metatron for one moment.

00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:33.252 align:middle line:90%
so Metatron's are coming in.

00:22:33.252 --> 00:22:34.586 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Metatron's started --

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:39.158 align:middle line:84%
well I continue this path
of learning, for 33 years,

00:22:39.158 --> 00:22:43.562 align:middle line:84%
and I was a metaphysical
student and with a lot

00:22:43.562 --> 00:22:46.932 align:middle line:84%
of on the job training as I told
you we got caught in a Ku Di Ta,

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:48.600 align:middle line:84%
they burned down
the city around us.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.203 align:middle line:84%
We were rescued by the
French Foreign Legion.

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:55.007 align:middle line:84%
And so we dealt with the
devastation of energy from fear.

00:22:55.007 --> 00:22:59.077 align:middle line:84%
We were trapped in a
situation where people were --

00:22:59.077 --> 00:23:01.613 align:middle line:84%
hostages were being
taken and set on fire.

00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:05.918 align:middle line:84%
And we hid for three days
and there was that sense

00:23:05.918 --> 00:23:08.620 align:middle line:90%
of total fear, total despair.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.424 align:middle line:84%
And so I experienced
that as did my wife.

00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:15.494 align:middle line:84%
And our son was at that time
a little bit too young to have

00:23:15.494 --> 00:23:21.567 align:middle line:84%
to face it but -- so I went
through a great variety

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:84%
of experiences and then when
I moved back to the states

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.907 align:middle line:84%
in the late-90's I
started having this urge

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:31.477 align:middle line:90%
to do a vision quest.

00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:36.748 align:middle line:84%
I started having dreams of a
Native American that was coming

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:40.085 align:middle line:84%
to me and telling me that I
needed to do a vision quest.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:42.387 align:middle line:84%
I didn't really know
what one was

00:23:42.387 --> 00:23:46.725 align:middle line:84%
and after this appearance
continued

00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:52.197 align:middle line:84%
for about six months I
decided to do it and so

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:56.101 align:middle line:84%
for the next four years I
did five day vision quests.

00:23:56.101 --> 00:24:01.573 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself in London
at the -- on a business trip.

00:24:01.573 --> 00:24:05.244 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
earlier about dealing

00:24:05.244 --> 00:24:09.414 align:middle line:84%
with psychic attacks and we
dealt with the African Shamans,

00:24:09.414 --> 00:24:12.351 align:middle line:84%
the Brazilian Shamans
and as I started getting

00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:15.654 align:middle line:84%
into the corporate management
side I met the real masters

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:17.289 align:middle line:90%
of psychic attack [laughter].

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:18.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Laughter] You bet.

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:19.157 align:middle line:84%
>> James: In the
corporate world.

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:20.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: [Laughter]
Corporate world.

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:21.627 align:middle line:84%
>> James: People who
were control freaks...

00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:22.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:24.129 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...and absolutely
thought the world...

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And have no fear.

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.666 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And would
intimidate people.

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And you know and so that was
a really interesting lesson

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.838 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you would deal with
the international aspect of it.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:40.879 align:middle line:84%
Because I worked for a French
company and I was a minority

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:43.582 align:middle line:84%
as an American and then
you learn, you know,

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:46.118 align:middle line:84%
the nuances of what
nationalities feel

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:47.486 align:middle line:90%
about one another [laughter].

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:50.923 align:middle line:84%
And you had to learn
how to be diplomatic.

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:54.560 align:middle line:84%
You had to learn the concerns
that other people perhaps --

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:59.331 align:middle line:84%
and my wife being
British, you know,

00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:02.634 align:middle line:84%
you would hear what certain
nationalities really think

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:03.569 align:middle line:90%
about American's [laughter].

00:25:03.569 --> 00:25:04.336 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right exactly.

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:06.138 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Through closed doors.

00:25:06.138 --> 00:25:06.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Being
married to a Brit...

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:07.973 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Right exactly.

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...myself,
I'm well aware of that.

00:25:09.575 --> 00:25:14.546 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And so it was an
interesting lesson and I,

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:17.115 align:middle line:84%
you know, would very
often have an Italian boss

00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:21.653 align:middle line:84%
or an Egyptian boss and you'd
learn all the different nuances

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:25.123 align:middle line:84%
of what -- you know, of
how we were all the same

00:25:25.123 --> 00:25:29.461 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time how certain
religions and ethnics groups

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and nationalities had different
opinions of one another.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.601 align:middle line:84%
And so it was a balancing to
learn how to deal with those.

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:39.071 align:middle line:84%
But in London -- I spent a lot
of time in London and I would

00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:42.774 align:middle line:84%
on weekends go to
the psychic fair

00:25:42.774 --> 00:25:45.877 align:middle line:84%
that they would have
almost every weekend.

00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And so there were some brilliant
readers there in those days.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.716 align:middle line:90%
This was in the '90s.

00:25:50.716 --> 00:25:55.554 align:middle line:84%
And a lot were from India
and extremely talented.

00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And they -- this
first lady to tell me

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:03.428 align:middle line:84%
about this Native American was
a lady from Bombay, now Mumbai.

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:06.898 align:middle line:84%
Brilliant palmist and
really, really good.

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:11.136 align:middle line:84%
And I had some amazing -- I
worked in India for a while just

00:26:11.136 --> 00:26:12.738 align:middle line:90%
to skip back -- and I had --

00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:17.376 align:middle line:84%
every hotel had an astrological
-- had an astrologist.

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:21.079 align:middle line:84%
And I think I had a $10 reading
one time with an astrologer

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:25.384 align:middle line:84%
in Bombay that I found about
three years or four years later

00:26:25.384 --> 00:26:28.787 align:middle line:84%
that was unbelievable
in its accuracy.

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And so I was told about
this Indian, I went --

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.327 align:middle line:84%
I found myself later in
Singapore had another reading,

00:26:35.327 --> 00:26:36.695 align:middle line:90%
told about this Native American.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:38.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So the
Indian keeps coming up?

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:39.731 align:middle line:84%
>> James: It keeps
coming up and so...

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.266 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now are we talking
Native American or East Indian?

00:26:41.266 --> 00:26:42.167 align:middle line:84%
>> James: It was
Native American.

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:42.801 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Native American.

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:43.935 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:46.638 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And so finally
I got on the internet,

00:26:46.638 --> 00:26:50.075 align:middle line:84%
found someone I thought that
could offer me the opportunity

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:53.879 align:middle line:84%
to -- and what they were telling
me in the vision was fast.

00:26:53.879 --> 00:26:55.347 align:middle line:90%
That's what I was getting; fast.

00:26:55.347 --> 00:26:58.984 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
doing a five day fast.

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:02.821 align:middle line:84%
And then I did it with
someone that I basically --

00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted someone
to keep an eye on me.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:09.828 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to go to a power
node, fast for five days

00:27:09.828 --> 00:27:11.129 align:middle line:90%
and see what happened.

00:27:11.129 --> 00:27:12.531 align:middle line:90%
And I did that.

00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:17.636 align:middle line:84%
and the first year that I did it
I did it here and I lost weight

00:27:17.636 --> 00:27:19.438 align:middle line:90%
and not much else happened.

00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:20.572 align:middle line:90%
The second year I did it

00:27:20.572 --> 00:27:23.942 align:middle line:84%
on Yaqui Native American
reservation in Tacate,

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:30.449 align:middle line:84%
Mexico and it was
a barren dust bowel

00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:33.185 align:middle line:84%
and the wind blew 50 miles
an hour the entire time.

00:27:33.185 --> 00:27:36.688 align:middle line:84%
My eyes were full of
dust, my nose and my hair

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:39.791 align:middle line:84%
and it was really
quite difficult

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:42.494 align:middle line:90%
and I did not have a vision.

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:49.301 align:middle line:84%
And then the next year came
around and I prepared my prayer

00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:52.003 align:middle line:84%
of tithes and I went up on the
mountain and it was in December

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:57.209 align:middle line:84%
and it was here in the Redrock
National Forest on Shamans Dome.

00:27:57.209 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: In Sedona.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And it was
snowing and there was --

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.383 align:middle line:84%
I had my blanket
an my sleeping bag

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:08.053 align:middle line:84%
and I'd taken a week vacation
and I'm wondering what

00:28:08.053 --> 00:28:09.821 align:middle line:84%
in the heck I'm doing
out here on the ground.

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:11.857 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing this?

00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:14.993 align:middle line:84%
And on the fourth day it had
snowed all night and then I woke

00:28:14.993 --> 00:28:16.795 align:middle line:90%
up happy to see the sun come

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:19.664 align:middle line:84%
out because despite the snow
it would get fairly comfortable

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:21.366 align:middle line:90%
during the day time.

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:26.004 align:middle line:84%
And I woke up and I saw a Native
America sitting in front of me,

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:27.739 align:middle line:84%
the one that had
come in my dreams.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.708 align:middle line:84%
And he had a mountain
lion with him.

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:32.778 align:middle line:84%
And energy just rolled
up my arms.

00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:34.880 align:middle line:90%
And my first thought was,

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.314 align:middle line:84%
"My God I'm having a
vision [laughter]."

00:28:36.314 --> 00:28:37.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Uh-huh.

00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:40.185 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And I closed my
eyes and he didn't go away.

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:42.120 align:middle line:90%
And we began communicating.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.655 align:middle line:84%
He told me his name
was Redfeather.

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:47.859 align:middle line:84%
And he told me to come
with him and I got up

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:52.230 align:middle line:84%
and we walked together up
on top of shamans dome.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.632 align:middle line:90%
Halfway there he was gone.

00:28:53.632 --> 00:28:55.100 align:middle line:90%
I didn't see him again.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:29:00.739 align:middle line:84%
And when I got to the top I had
my first out of body experience

00:29:00.739 --> 00:29:05.277 align:middle line:84%
and I actually flew over the
valley, saw things in reality,

00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:09.414 align:middle line:84%
in 3D I saw cars moving,
I saw people waking up

00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:10.782 align:middle line:90%
and turning on their lights.

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:13.652 align:middle line:90%
And it was astonishing.

00:29:13.652 --> 00:29:16.655 align:middle line:84%
And so I did that and that
was a real breakthrough.

00:29:16.655 --> 00:29:22.360 align:middle line:84%
I had done the LSD experience
when I was in my early 20's.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.663 align:middle line:90%
I was an athlete in university

00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:84%
so I never smoked,
I never drank and...

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.901 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you'd done
a lot of preparation.

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:31.403 align:middle line:84%
>> James: I did a
lot of preparation.

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:33.104 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Decades
really to get to the point

00:29:33.104 --> 00:29:34.639 align:middle line:84%
where this [inaudible]
could occur.

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:38.343 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And so I did a vision
quest the next year on top

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:41.179 align:middle line:84%
of the San Francisco Peaks
and had an extraordinary

00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:43.782 align:middle line:84%
out of body experience
and vision.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:48.553 align:middle line:84%
And in that vision I was
told to go to South America

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:49.054 align:middle line:90%
and do [foreign word].

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:51.223 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:57.696 align:middle line:84%
I went to Bolivia and I had
a remarkable coincidentally

00:29:57.696 --> 00:30:01.333 align:middle line:84%
meeting with someone that turned
out to be the college roommate

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:04.536 align:middle line:84%
of the attorney who
was our human resources

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:09.040 align:middle line:90%
vice-president [laughter].

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.308 align:middle line:90%
And he took me at 7,000 --

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.043 align:middle line:84%
17,000 feet on a mountain
outside of Lapaz, Bolivia,

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.779 align:middle line:84%
a volcano and I had an
astonishing experience.

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first
encounter with Metatron.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:22.554 align:middle line:84%
And he told me to come
back six months later,

00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:26.224 align:middle line:84%
which I didn't want to
because [foreign word] is an

00:30:26.224 --> 00:30:29.527 align:middle line:84%
extraordinary experience, but
you have to prepare for it.

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:30.495 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:30:30.495 --> 00:30:32.297 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And I want
to clarify here

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:34.666 align:middle line:84%
that I am not advocating
it for everyone.

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:36.868 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We just interviewed
Graham Hancock recently...

00:30:36.868 --> 00:30:38.103 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes.

00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:39.371 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and talked
about that for quite a bit.

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:42.073 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And it was an
astonishing experience for me.

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
At one point I was
aware of being

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:47.646 align:middle line:90%
in three places at one time.

00:30:47.646 --> 00:30:53.118 align:middle line:84%
And what it actually did for
me was rewire the connection

00:30:53.118 --> 00:30:57.088 align:middle line:84%
between my conscious mind
and my subconscious mind

00:30:57.088 --> 00:31:00.792 align:middle line:84%
that allowed doors to
open that stayed open.

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:03.595 align:middle line:84%
And so when the experience
was complete --

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:08.333 align:middle line:84%
and I did it five times
over a period of two years.

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:12.103 align:middle line:84%
I was able to work
in etheric realms

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:14.406 align:middle line:90%
with a higher version of myself.

00:31:14.406 --> 00:31:16.808 align:middle line:90%
I was able to carry an energy

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:20.712 align:middle line:84%
that earlier I would not have
been capable of carrying.

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:23.048 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how Metatron
started to come in.

00:31:23.048 --> 00:31:24.316 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay and we could --

00:31:24.316 --> 00:31:26.318 align:middle line:84%
we could go on quite
a bit about that.

00:31:26.318 --> 00:31:29.454 align:middle line:84%
That you have learned so much in
your relationship with Metatron

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:32.123 align:middle line:84%
and also through
your open gateways.

00:31:32.123 --> 00:31:33.091 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes.

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:33.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And your
own experience

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:90%
with the earth and the minerals.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.763 align:middle line:84%
And so because we
are -- we have --

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:42.867 align:middle line:84%
we're at a finite time frame
right now, let's go back then

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:47.005 align:middle line:84%
to what Metatron was telling
you that may have overlaid some

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:50.742 align:middle line:84%
of the Casey materials about
the gemstone and their interface

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:52.344 align:middle line:90%
with the human consciousness...

00:31:52.344 --> 00:31:53.345 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Absolutely.

00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:54.579 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...bearing
and so forth.

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:58.683 align:middle line:84%
>> James: The key thing
that I teach, that I learned

00:31:58.683 --> 00:32:03.188 align:middle line:84%
through this experience is that
there is a misconception I think

00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:07.759 align:middle line:84%
for many people that
the human auric field is

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:10.462 align:middle line:90%
automatically managed.

00:32:10.462 --> 00:32:11.563 align:middle line:90%
It is not.

00:32:11.563 --> 00:32:13.431 align:middle line:90%
It requires maintenance.

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:16.534 align:middle line:84%
And there are keys
and responsibilities

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:21.039 align:middle line:84%
to maintaining our auric field
in the new energy of 2013.

00:32:21.039 --> 00:32:25.143 align:middle line:84%
The energy of the earth is
higher than it was in 2012

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:30.181 align:middle line:84%
and it will continue to
increase not just in terms

00:32:30.181 --> 00:32:32.884 align:middle line:84%
of the human resonance
but also in terms

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:35.553 align:middle line:90%
of the anionic to canonic ratio.

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:38.556 align:middle line:84%
All of the solar storms that
are bombarding our earth have

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:42.460 align:middle line:84%
changed that ratio and
that ratio has been proven

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:50.135 align:middle line:84%
in certain scientific tests to
create psychoactive experience.

00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:54.839 align:middle line:84%
I take the same data that the
universities have garnered

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:56.608 align:middle line:90%
and draw a different conclusion.

00:32:56.608 --> 00:33:03.448 align:middle line:84%
Their conclusion may be
that an anionic ratio change

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:05.817 align:middle line:90%
creates hallucinations.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:09.554 align:middle line:84%
Therefore the hallucinations
are not real.

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:11.222 align:middle line:90%
I take those studies and say

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:17.629 align:middle line:84%
that the anionic ratio change
opens doors within the pineal,

00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:21.666 align:middle line:84%
and allows us to have
multi-dimensional experiences.

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:25.503 align:middle line:84%
And so that is happening
all over the planet now

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.038 align:middle line:90%
because of the solar winds.

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.173 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:29.407 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Because of the
billions and billions...

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.676 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Huge solar
blasts that have occurred.

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.712 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Anionic charges that
are now coming around the earth.

00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:38.016 align:middle line:84%
It has been proven that
a six to one anionic

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:40.585 align:middle line:84%
to canonic ratio
opens the pineal.

00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:42.153 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And what
are we at now?

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:43.488 align:middle line:84%
Is that what it's
kind of hitting?

00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:46.091 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Well it is increasing.

00:33:46.091 --> 00:33:49.661 align:middle line:84%
NASA has photographs
of jet streams

00:33:49.661 --> 00:33:53.932 align:middle line:84%
of anoint plasma circulating
the earth and one of the places

00:33:53.932 --> 00:33:58.203 align:middle line:84%
that they seem to be
stationary is Sedona, Arizona.

00:33:58.203 --> 00:33:59.304 align:middle line:90%
The Sonoran Desert.

00:33:59.304 --> 00:34:01.506 align:middle line:84%
All the way up to
the Grand Canyon.

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:03.174 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so
what does that mean?

00:34:03.174 --> 00:34:06.878 align:middle line:84%
>> James: That this place is
becoming even more powerful.

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.715 align:middle line:84%
>> James: But at the same
time it is a crucible.

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:15.487 align:middle line:84%
Sedona is not a place that many
people can necessarily come

00:34:15.487 --> 00:34:19.724 align:middle line:84%
to for extended period of time
without major adjustments.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:23.328 align:middle line:84%
If you come here you're going to
deal with what needs to be dealt

00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:25.563 align:middle line:90%
with and that's not always fun.

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:28.800 align:middle line:84%
You are going to see what
doesn't serve you and while

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.802 align:middle line:84%
that may not be fun
it is why we are here.

00:34:31.802 --> 00:34:35.607 align:middle line:84%
We have to face out obstacles,
we have to face our challenges.

00:34:35.607 --> 00:34:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise we can't
-- cannot transcend them.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.246 align:middle line:90%
But it is not always fun.

00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:44.648 align:middle line:84%
We have to see our
own imperfections

00:34:44.648 --> 00:34:49.119 align:middle line:84%
and very often we're required
to work them out with a partner.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And so it can be a
conflictory relationship

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.463 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time
with purpose.

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:00.698 align:middle line:84%
And that is the energy
of Sedona.

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:01.599 align:middle line:90%
Sedona...

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.167 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's interesting.

00:35:02.167 --> 00:35:03.301 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yeah.

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:04.602 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: People that
live here I've been --

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:06.538 align:middle line:84%
I came here originally
in 2000...

00:35:06.538 --> 00:35:07.839 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yeah.

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then left for
a few years and came back

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.542 align:middle line:84%
to the same house
as a matter of fact.

00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:14.646 align:middle line:84%
And the one thing that everyone
talk about is do not take --

00:35:14.646 --> 00:35:16.881 align:middle line:84%
move to Sedona with
your partner.

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.283 align:middle line:90%
You will lose your partner.

00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:20.585 align:middle line:90%
That relationship will be over.

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:23.688 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen that again, and
again, and exactly what you say.

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:26.624 align:middle line:84%
Where people couldn't handle
the stress that it brings

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:28.826 align:middle line:84%
to the table and the
relationships blow apart.

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.862 align:middle line:84%
But then you usually
find someone you're more

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:31.629 align:middle line:90%
in alignment with.

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.031 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Right.

00:35:33.031 --> 00:35:36.534 align:middle line:84%
And there is often a purpose too
in the relationship that ends.

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:37.302 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.636 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Very often it --

00:35:38.636 --> 00:35:42.874 align:middle line:84%
the displeasure the other
partner may see and report back

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:44.776 align:middle line:90%
to you makes you aware

00:35:44.776 --> 00:35:48.313 align:middle line:84%
of a characteristic you may
want not to carry into...

00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:49.247 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:50.481 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...the
next relationship.

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:51.716 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we could talk
a while about that one.

00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:53.751 align:middle line:84%
But let's just say --
suffice to say that's true.

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:54.919 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Well let me say

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:59.791 align:middle line:84%
that there is also a
eighth century prediction

00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:07.198 align:middle line:84%
from a Tibetan Lama that
said at the time that the --

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:13.972 align:middle line:84%
at the time that the eagle
flies, that the iron eagle flies

00:36:13.972 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and the mountain lion runs on
wheels, the Dharma will return

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.913 align:middle line:90%
to the land of the red man."

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:25.583 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what we felt that
this [foreign word] was about.

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:31.923 align:middle line:84%
That it is time in 2013
that the truth comes back

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:33.591 align:middle line:90%
to the -- this part of...

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:34.926 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The four corners.

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:35.493 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yeah.

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:36.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:36.828 align:middle line:90%
>> James: The red lands.

00:36:36.828 --> 00:36:38.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:38.096 --> 00:36:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> James: To this part of
America to disseminate all

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.332 align:middle line:84%
around because it
has often been said

00:36:41.332 --> 00:36:44.769 align:middle line:84%
that America is a
corporation based on profit.

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:47.038 align:middle line:84%
People have lost
their sovereignty

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:52.143 align:middle line:84%
that people are not citizens
they're employees and it is

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:55.513 align:middle line:84%
in a place like this that
the truth is revealed

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:57.615 align:middle line:84%
and people being
to ask for more.

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:58.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:36:58.883 --> 00:37:00.918 align:middle line:84%
>> James: People -- the
truth can no longer be hidden

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:02.253 align:middle line:90%
in shadows.

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:06.724 align:middle line:84%
And so I think Sedona will
emerge, is emerging as one

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.259 align:middle line:90%
of the most important centers

00:37:08.259 --> 00:37:11.729 align:middle line:84%
for North America
replacing perhaps Mt. Shasta

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:13.031 align:middle line:90%
in that regard.

00:37:13.031 --> 00:37:14.999 align:middle line:90%
For a while it was Shasta

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:17.735 align:middle line:84%
and it actually had a
stronger energy than Sedona.

00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:20.872 align:middle line:84%
I think that is flip flopping
back for a different purpose.

00:37:20.872 --> 00:37:23.207 align:middle line:84%
Not to say that Shasta is
not incredibility powerful.

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:24.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: it is.

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>> James: I've had
astonishing experiences there.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:26.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:37:26.044 --> 00:37:27.445 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:29.681 align:middle line:84%
>> James: But I think there is a
role-taking place in Sedona now

00:37:29.681 --> 00:37:31.816 align:middle line:84%
that was not here
a few years ago.

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.017 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I would
agree with that

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.218 align:middle line:84%
and there are times
to go away...

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.353 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes.

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:36.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and there
are times to go back.

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.189 align:middle line:84%
And it seems as though we
have reentered Sedona right

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:38.856 align:middle line:90%
on queue...

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:39.991 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes.

00:37:39.991 --> 00:37:41.225 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...for this
incredible potentization

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:90%
of energies which I love.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.529 align:middle line:90%
I like bathing in it.

00:37:44.529 --> 00:37:46.998 align:middle line:84%
Now Sedona's full of
gem shops [laughter].

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:48.132 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes.

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:49.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Gem and
mineral and quartz shops.

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:51.803 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And the key to
Sedona is auric maintenance.

00:37:51.803 --> 00:37:52.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.406 align:middle line:84%
>> James: If you come
to Sedona and you

00:37:55.406 --> 00:37:57.575 align:middle line:84%
for example have
a hertz enfield --

00:37:57.575 --> 00:38:01.813 align:middle line:84%
and this is a random number
-- in your aura of 10 hertz

00:38:01.813 --> 00:38:05.416 align:middle line:84%
and you come to an area
that is suddenly 100 hertz;

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.617 align:middle line:90%
what's going to happen?

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:10.321 align:middle line:84%
There will be a mechanical
equalization in which --

00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:13.524 align:middle line:84%
and this is physics,
this is engineering.

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:17.695 align:middle line:90%
If there is an Ovid surrounded

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.931 align:middle line:84%
by a higher pressure
we'll implode.

00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:23.301 align:middle line:84%
And so your auric field
will rupture if you come

00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:25.737 align:middle line:84%
from another place and
you come to a great place

00:38:25.737 --> 00:38:28.973 align:middle line:84%
of greater intensity it
will absolutely rupture,

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.975 align:middle line:90%
it will mechanically equalize

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.311 align:middle line:84%
so that the higher
energy can come in.

00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:35.947 align:middle line:84%
But in that process
you will bleed energy.

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:38.449 align:middle line:90%
You will lose the appropriate

00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:41.619 align:middle line:84%
and requisite circuitry
of your auric field.

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.121 align:middle line:90%
How do you deal with that?

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:46.057 align:middle line:90%
Gemstones are energy batteries.

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:48.059 align:middle line:84%
And so I have developed
what I believe

00:38:48.059 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
to be an ancient knowledge
that I call metatronic shield

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:58.603 align:middle line:84%
and that is on one hand you wear
a single refractive gemstone.

00:38:58.603 --> 00:39:01.706 align:middle line:84%
There is only three single
refractive gemstones...

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:02.507 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What are they?

00:39:02.507 --> 00:39:03.074 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...on the planet.

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:06.611 align:middle line:90%
Diamond. Garnet.

00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:08.546 align:middle line:90%
And Spinel.

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:09.313 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And what?

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:10.381 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Spinel.

00:39:10.381 --> 00:39:11.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Spinel.

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:12.950 align:middle line:90%
>> James: S-P-I-N-E-L.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.553 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to a ruby
except its single refractive.

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:16.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:39:16.387 --> 00:39:17.822 align:middle line:90%
So that is on the -- which hand?

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:21.259 align:middle line:84%
>> James: That generally
starts out on the left hand.

00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:22.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Left hand.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.396 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Where you wear -- most
people wear their wedding band.

00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:26.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And interestingly
most females have a diamond

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.270 align:middle line:84%
which is a single refractive
stone and so on the left hand.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.838 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, now let's
look at the right hand.

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:35.106 align:middle line:90%
>> James: On the right hand --

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:37.275 align:middle line:84%
and let me also put
in the caveat

00:39:37.275 --> 00:39:40.445 align:middle line:84%
that after a while you can
switch these intuitively

00:39:40.445 --> 00:39:42.480 align:middle line:84%
after you develop
the relationship

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.782 align:middle line:90%
with the living consciousness

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:47.952 align:middle line:84%
that exists within
that gemstone.

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:50.955 align:middle line:84%
Because they are
crystalline beings.

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:52.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:55.393 align:middle line:84%
>> James: It is a collective
organized energy and one

00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:58.696 align:middle line:84%
of the mistakes a lot of people
make is they do not recognize

00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:02.533 align:middle line:84%
gemstones as members
of the mineral kingdom.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:06.070 align:middle line:84%
They are the most sophisticated
members of the mineral kingdom

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:11.008 align:middle line:84%
and they operate in
more compact centers.

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:16.147 align:middle line:84%
But so the fir- -- the three
single refractive are diamond,

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:18.015 align:middle line:90%
garnet and Rhodolite --

00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:20.485 align:middle line:84%
or I'm sorry, diamond,
garnet and spinel.

00:40:20.485 --> 00:40:22.053 align:middle line:84%
Rhodalite is a type
of garnet [laughter].

00:40:22.053 --> 00:40:23.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:25.022 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Everything else
is double refractive.

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:26.224 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Everything else?

00:40:26.224 --> 00:40:27.358 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Everything else
is double refractive.

00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, on the rings, the
rings have requirements.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:37.535 align:middle line:84%
The single refractive as a
diamond must be 2 carats.

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.871 align:middle line:90%
Not in total carat weight.

00:40:39.871 --> 00:40:41.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: now people
are thinking ah,

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:42.840 align:middle line:84%
garnet sounds a little
better than a diamond.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.742 align:middle line:84%
>> James: The garnet
comes into play.

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:45.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.777 align:middle line:90%
>> James: So does the spinel.

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:49.280 align:middle line:90%
But, here is another thing.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:55.253 align:middle line:84%
Diamonds are not as expensive as
people think if they break away

00:40:55.253 --> 00:40:56.687 align:middle line:90%
from the jewelry retail...

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:57.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:58.456 align:middle line:90%
eBay.

00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.691 align:middle line:84%
>> James: I mean interestingly
there are certain groups

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:03.294 align:middle line:84%
who seem to have traditionally
controlled the diamond market.

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:04.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:06.631 align:middle line:90%
>> James: And it's the Dutch.

00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:09.467 align:middle line:84%
I mean almost all the
gemstones in Brazil are...

00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:10.067 align:middle line:90%
>> Dutch-American.

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:11.402 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:13.037 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...controlled by
Amsterdam Saur or Hans Stern.

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:14.238 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:15.106 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And then you
have the DeBeers group...

00:41:15.106 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: DeBeers.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.408 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...controlling
diamonds.

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:19.911 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a cartel that
fixes the prices on diamonds.

00:41:19.911 --> 00:41:23.014 align:middle line:84%
But if you get outside of
that you can find diamonds

00:41:23.014 --> 00:41:25.016 align:middle line:90%
at astonishing values.

00:41:25.016 --> 00:41:29.487 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give the listeners
here and viewers a tip; eBay.

00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:30.454 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah [laughter].

00:41:30.454 --> 00:41:31.522 align:middle line:84%
I heard you say that
the other day.

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:32.323 align:middle line:90%
>> James: eBay.

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:33.391 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay [laughter].

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:34.625 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And that
sounds shocking at first

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:37.495 align:middle line:84%
but if you make sure you
have a seven day return

00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:41.933 align:middle line:84%
on that purchase and,
you know, how to --

00:41:41.933 --> 00:41:45.203 align:middle line:84%
and you have to have the
ability to refract the stone

00:41:45.203 --> 00:41:48.272 align:middle line:84%
with a refractometer to make
sure it is what they say it is.

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:51.442 align:middle line:90%
You can get some amazing deals.

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:53.277 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we're
looking at two carats

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:55.980 align:middle line:84%
if we can find a diamond
or a garnet or a spinel,

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.215 align:middle line:84%
and everything else on
the other hand is...

00:41:58.215 --> 00:41:59.817 align:middle line:84%
>> James: The garnet
must be three carats.

00:41:59.817 --> 00:42:01.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The garnet
three carats.

00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:02.353 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.054 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And the spinel
must be three carats.

00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:04.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Three carats.

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.389 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Because they
are not as powerful...

00:42:05.389 --> 00:42:06.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.325 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...as the diamond.

00:42:07.325 --> 00:42:08.392 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And now let's
talk about technology

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:10.361 align:middle line:84%
on the right hand
with everything else.

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:13.197 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Everything else is
double refractive and that --

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:16.233 align:middle line:84%
this is really where you should
go into the [inaudible] system.

00:42:16.233 --> 00:42:21.606 align:middle line:84%
I recommend starting off
with a birthstone or a stone

00:42:21.606 --> 00:42:25.109 align:middle line:90%
that you are happy with.

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:28.879 align:middle line:84%
Amethyst should be -- and all of
the colored stones really need

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.448 align:middle line:90%
to be at least three carats.

00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:31.916 align:middle line:90%
Three to five carats.

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.484 align:middle line:90%
But that can be an Amethyst,

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:36.220 align:middle line:84%
it can be a ruby, it
can be a sapphire.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.722 align:middle line:84%
Ruby and Sapphire
are the same thing.

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:43.194 align:middle line:84%
They are just simply
different colors of kerendon.

00:42:43.194 --> 00:42:44.261 align:middle line:90%
Citrine.

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:45.129 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Topaz.

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:46.263 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Topaz.

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:47.531 align:middle line:90%
Emerald, Tourmaline.

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.101 align:middle line:84%
so basically all the
other semi-precious

00:42:50.101 --> 00:42:51.035 align:middle line:90%
and precious stones.

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:52.103 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Right.

00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Three carats
on the right hand.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:53.904 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Three to five carats.

00:42:53.904 --> 00:42:55.272 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Three to five.

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.507 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And the other thing
with the metatronic shield,

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:58.275 align:middle line:84%
you should wear metal
on each wrist.

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.844 align:middle line:90%
The body is symmetrical.

00:42:59.844 --> 00:43:02.313 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
working with auric flow --

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:05.282 align:middle line:84%
and that is why we're
talking about these gemstones.

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:07.618 align:middle line:84%
If you're buying these
gemstones as a vanity,

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:10.221 align:middle line:84%
as an ego boost,
buy the fake stuff.

00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:14.525 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, that's -- if
that's the way you're looking

00:43:14.525 --> 00:43:16.127 align:middle line:90%
at them it's inappropriate.

00:43:16.127 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:84%
What you need to
recognize with gemstones is

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.232 align:middle line:90%
that they are energy tools.

00:43:21.232 --> 00:43:24.235 align:middle line:84%
Metatron says that the
reason that women live longer

00:43:24.235 --> 00:43:26.604 align:middle line:84%
than men is because
they wear gems.

00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:28.372 align:middle line:90%
And that these are energy tools

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:33.344 align:middle line:84%
and they will absolutely not
only fortify your auric field

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:37.315 align:middle line:84%
from the bombardments
of microwaves,

00:43:37.315 --> 00:43:40.918 align:middle line:84%
from the incredible
stress and --

00:43:40.918 --> 00:43:43.854 align:middle line:84%
or depletion of airplane
travel which is...

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:45.556 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I'm on twice a week.

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:47.058 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Shorter
flights are not as bad.

00:43:47.058 --> 00:43:48.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:50.027 align:middle line:84%
>> James: But when you
fly like you know some

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:51.662 align:middle line:84%
of the international speakers
we had at [inaudible].

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:52.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.632 align:middle line:90%
>> James: 14, 15-hour flights.

00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:55.866 align:middle line:90%
Your husband's British...

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's pretty brutal.

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> James: It depletes
the auric field

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.374 align:middle line:84%
because the flight takes
place at 38,000 feet

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:07.344 align:middle line:84%
above the 30,000 limit
of the human resonance

00:44:07.344 --> 00:44:09.113 align:middle line:90%
where the stratosphere starts.

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:15.219 align:middle line:84%
NASA has discovered that the
human organs depend on the pulse

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:18.255 align:middle line:84%
of 7.8 Hertz of the
human resonance.

00:44:18.255 --> 00:44:20.725 align:middle line:84%
And as the human
resonance increases

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:22.893 align:middle line:90%
so will our regulation to it.

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:25.696 align:middle line:84%
But when you're outside of
that it throws off the organ

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:27.798 align:middle line:90%
function, the glandular function

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:30.267 align:middle line:84%
and the aura becomes
depleted for a few days.

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:31.502 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well you
can tell that.

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:32.903 align:middle line:84%
You feel totally trashed
when you get off the plane.

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:34.138 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Absolutely.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:35.473 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things
you can do to minimize that.

00:44:35.473 --> 00:44:38.976 align:middle line:84%
I recommend -- I will have
recommendations in my book

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:40.611 align:middle line:84%
about what to wear
for air travels,

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:43.214 align:middle line:84%
how to deal with that air
travel and in fact, you can read

00:44:43.214 --> 00:44:46.317 align:middle line:90%
that on my website now free.

00:44:46.317 --> 00:44:48.652 align:middle line:90%
And all my articles...

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:49.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Earthkeepers.com?

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:50.755 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Earth-keeper.com.

00:44:50.755 --> 00:44:54.959 align:middle line:84%
if you look under the earth
keep chronicles I have 70

00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:57.728 align:middle line:84%
or 80 articles and channels
on there, one of which talks

00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:58.729 align:middle line:90%
about auric maintenance.

00:44:58.729 --> 00:44:59.697 align:middle line:90%
It goes into this.

00:44:59.697 --> 00:45:00.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay,
now you were talking

00:45:00.631 --> 00:45:01.866 align:middle line:90%
about wearing metal on your...

00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Metal on each...

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...both sides.

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:04.502 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...wrists.

00:45:04.502 --> 00:45:05.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Does it
matter what kind of metal?

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:06.637 align:middle line:90%
>> James: It can be any --

00:45:06.637 --> 00:45:08.706 align:middle line:84%
and each metal has
a different purpose.

00:45:08.706 --> 00:45:10.741 align:middle line:90%
Gold is the most noble.

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:12.643 align:middle line:84%
Platinum is even
better than gold

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.311 align:middle line:84%
but who can afford
platinum these days.

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:16.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Who can
afford gold [laughter]?

00:45:16.347 --> 00:45:17.148 align:middle line:84%
>> James: [Laughter]
Palladium...

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:18.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:20.351 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...is less expensive
than gold or platinum.

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:23.320 align:middle line:84%
It's very good but you can't get
it in jewelry form very often.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.424 align:middle line:84%
But you can buy bullion
bars of it and have it made.

00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:30.628 align:middle line:84%
And so silver is
very, very good.

00:45:30.628 --> 00:45:32.263 align:middle line:90%
Copper is very good.

00:45:32.263 --> 00:45:33.798 align:middle line:90%
Brass is very good.

00:45:33.798 --> 00:45:36.967 align:middle line:84%
Steel, stainless
steel was recommended

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:40.371 align:middle line:84%
by Edgar Casey one
time as being able

00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:43.407 align:middle line:84%
to prevent viruses
and the common cold.

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:44.508 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:46.143 align:middle line:84%
So you want to have
them equally balanced...

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:46.944 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Yes, yes.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:47.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...on each wrist.

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:49.079 align:middle line:84%
You want to have
bracelets on each wrist.

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.214 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Yes and it's
interesting in the --

00:45:50.214 --> 00:45:53.217 align:middle line:84%
in some of the ancient
worlds, in the Islamic

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:59.456 align:middle line:84%
and Hindu lands they will keep
count of a 14 day rising moon

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.792 align:middle line:84%
by having 14 bracelets
and then moving them

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.060 align:middle line:90%
over one day at a time.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, interesting.

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> James: But the
idea would be balance.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:06.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:07.531 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And it
can be a combination

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:08.365 align:middle line:90%
of any of the metals.

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:09.700 align:middle line:90%
They're all conductive.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay, now let's get

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:13.270 align:middle line:84%
into also some of
the other ones.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.971 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:14.538 align:middle line:90%
>> James: The pendant.

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:15.673 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:46:15.673 --> 00:46:18.609 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Lapis Lazuli
is the stone recommended

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:22.213 align:middle line:84%
by Edgar Casey more
than any other stone

00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:23.280 align:middle line:90%
in all of his readings.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.249 align:middle line:90%
More than 980 times.

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Lapis Lazuli is a
conglomerate crystal, is opaque,

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.288 align:middle line:84%
it does not pass light
through it but it puts

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:35.426 align:middle line:84%
out an incredible pulse and it
is important the Lapis Lazuli

00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:38.128 align:middle line:84%
which by definition
will have Pyrite in it.

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:41.232 align:middle line:84%
Pyrite is a crystalline
metal that occurs

00:46:41.232 --> 00:46:44.969 align:middle line:84%
in hexagonal cubes even
at the molecular level.

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:49.106 align:middle line:84%
So you want to see those
little sparkles of fools good,

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:51.175 align:middle line:90%
Pyrite is a brilliant metal.

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:54.879 align:middle line:84%
It is very beneficial for
the human aura and it occurs

00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:57.014 align:middle line:90%
in Lapis Lazuli, the navy blue.

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:59.650 align:middle line:84%
And Lapis Lazuli
is not expensive.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.484 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Not it's not.

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:01.886 align:middle line:90%
>> James: It's very affordable.

00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:05.289 align:middle line:84%
But I do recommend that
the Lapis Lazuli pendant be

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:07.391 align:middle line:90%
at least 15 grams.

00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:10.427 align:middle line:84%
There are five carats to a
gram so you want to make sure

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:13.531 align:middle line:90%
that you get a 45-carat piece

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:15.466 align:middle line:84%
and quite honestly
I recommend it be

00:47:15.466 --> 00:47:18.535 align:middle line:90%
in more than that; 20 to 25.

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:20.571 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you want a
fairly large piece of it.

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:22.806 align:middle line:84%
And that can hang
anywhere on the chest?

00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:23.908 align:middle line:84%
>> James: It can
be right around --

00:47:23.908 --> 00:47:25.976 align:middle line:84%
anywhere from between
the neck and chest.

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:26.543 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:27.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:47:27.912 --> 00:47:31.849 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And with a noble metal
can be silver or gold chain.

00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:36.387 align:middle line:90%
And to carry the Lapis Lazuli.

00:47:36.387 --> 00:47:40.591 align:middle line:84%
But Lapis Lazuli is probably
the most important stone

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:43.027 align:middle line:90%
of this part and it is huge.

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:46.230 align:middle line:84%
Lapis comes out of the
Himalayas and out of Chile.

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:50.501 align:middle line:84%
And it is the corner
stone of the --

00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:53.804 align:middle line:84%
or the apex of the
metatronic shield.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:56.140 align:middle line:84%
The metaronic shield
is affordable.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.644 align:middle line:84%
There are great places to
get gemstones and in some

00:48:00.644 --> 00:48:05.582 align:middle line:84%
of my seminars I teach
people how to buy diamonds.

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:07.284 align:middle line:90%
To break out of the retail mode.

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:10.387 align:middle line:84%
But I also teach them
to make communication

00:48:10.387 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:84%
with the mineral kingdom
and contact the diamond

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.763 align:middle line:84%
to become available
to you and that works.

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.131 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely...

00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:22.299 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:23.701 align:middle line:84%
>> James: It's like
communicating with plants.

00:48:23.701 --> 00:48:26.937 align:middle line:84%
You communicate with minerals
and you call the diamond to you.

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:30.274 align:middle line:84%
I have incidences of finding
five carat diamond rings

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:33.610 align:middle line:84%
for a tenth of what
they would retail for.

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:34.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:48:34.712 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
so we have to talk to
the kingdom itself.

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:39.016 align:middle line:84%
Now we have the balancing, we
have the right and left hand,

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:39.950 align:middle line:90%
the right and left wrist.

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.285 align:middle line:90%
We have the pendant.

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:43.354 align:middle line:84%
Give us some ideas of
some other gemstones

00:48:43.354 --> 00:48:47.424 align:middle line:84%
and their specific kinds of uses
for say anxiety and depression.

00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Well there are
certain stones and a lot

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.862 align:middle line:84%
of the information
I provide comes

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.197 align:middle line:90%
from the Edgar Casey readings...

00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:54.431 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.232 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...which is a
cornerstone of credibility.

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:56.033 align:middle line:90%
Others...

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.101 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I agree.

00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:58.335 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...are just
short of my own --

00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:02.406 align:middle line:84%
I have had a fascination
with gemstones for 40 years

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:04.408 align:middle line:90%
and I worked with mounds...

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:05.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:06.043 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...of them in Brazil.

00:49:06.043 --> 00:49:09.013 align:middle line:90%
And I communicate with them.

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:12.416 align:middle line:84%
I can communicate with
gemstones and I can look

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.751 align:middle line:90%
at two different Amethysts

00:49:13.751 --> 00:49:18.856 align:middle line:84%
that have almost exactly the
same color saturation level

00:49:18.856 --> 00:49:21.792 align:middle line:84%
and understand their
different attributes.

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.528 align:middle line:84%
And that is not anything
you need to be --

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.897 align:middle line:84%
anyone who makes
an attempt to work

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:29.666 align:middle line:90%
with them, to understand them...

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:30.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They will
speak to you.

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:31.668 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:49:31.668 --> 00:49:33.103 align:middle line:84%
>> James: They will speak
to you and you will hear it.

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:38.342 align:middle line:84%
And it is just a -- gemstones
are amazing form of life.

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:39.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So it is...

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>> James: And...

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:42.379 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...one
other fantastic place

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:44.481 align:middle line:84%
to get gemstones is
at the Tucson mall.

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:45.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh you bet,
that's where I go.

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Tucson gem and mineral show for
10 to 20 cents on the dollar.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.988 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful quality.

00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.122 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Beautiful pieces.

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:52.923 align:middle line:84%
And you know there's a
few things that you need

00:49:52.923 --> 00:49:54.858 align:middle line:90%
to know and, you know.

00:49:54.858 --> 00:49:56.994 align:middle line:90%
But you can get great --

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.897 align:middle line:84%
you know generally speaking
you have to buy in volume...

00:49:59.897 --> 00:50:00.731 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:01.398 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...to get the deals.

00:50:01.398 --> 00:50:02.766 align:middle line:90%
But not always.

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:03.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:05.469 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And they're
certainly less expensive

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:06.937 align:middle line:84%
than what you're going
to get at jewelry stores.

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:11.041 align:middle line:84%
The minute a gemstone is in
a pre-mount that value --

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.943 align:middle line:90%
that cost is at least tripled.

00:50:12.943 --> 00:50:13.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.778 align:middle line:90%
>> James: You know.

00:50:14.778 --> 00:50:15.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so
let's talk about it.

00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:17.915 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
other stones that Casey...

00:50:17.915 --> 00:50:21.085 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Some other stones
that are absolutely unique.

00:50:21.085 --> 00:50:25.622 align:middle line:84%
The Emerald -- and this
-- I wear an Emerald.

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.291 align:middle line:90%
The emerald is recommended

00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:30.794 align:middle line:84%
as the most important
gemstone for healers.

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:38.102 align:middle line:84%
And that is because the
information that I receive is

00:50:38.102 --> 00:50:39.570 align:middle line:90%
that -- and Casey recommended

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:42.739 align:middle line:84%
that as the most
important stone for healing.

00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:48.479 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that when you are
a healer the Emerald helps keep

00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:52.216 align:middle line:84%
you from taking on the energy
of those that you are healing

00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:55.219 align:middle line:84%
or giving away too much
of your vital life force.

00:50:55.219 --> 00:50:58.422 align:middle line:84%
In other words it enables you
to channel the energy you send,

00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:01.759 align:middle line:84%
and not deplete your own banks
of energy in working with them.

00:51:01.759 --> 00:51:03.026 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:51:03.026 --> 00:51:05.362 align:middle line:84%
>> James: so the Emerald
is a very important stone.

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:06.597 align:middle line:90%
The garnet.

00:51:06.597 --> 00:51:09.199 align:middle line:90%
There are two types of stones

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:11.502 align:middle line:84%
that have color change
properties.

00:51:11.502 --> 00:51:15.739 align:middle line:84%
One is an Alexandrite
which is a form of crysbro

00:51:15.739 --> 00:51:18.675 align:middle line:90%
and the other is the garnet.

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:22.646 align:middle line:84%
Color change garnets, which
go from blue to red depending

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:24.014 align:middle line:90%
on whether you are

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:29.720 align:middle line:84%
in conventional lighting
or in sunlight.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.023 align:middle line:90%
And the Alexandrite I believe

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:38.529 align:middle line:84%
that these stones help you
develop the ability uniquely

00:51:38.529 --> 00:51:42.599 align:middle line:84%
to work in higher forms of
ultra violet consciousness.

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.968 align:middle line:90%
Ultra violet light.

00:51:44.968 --> 00:51:48.939 align:middle line:84%
They help you with your
multi-dimensional aspects.

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:55.245 align:middle line:84%
Gemstones occur in more than
the visible light spectrum just

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:56.914 align:middle line:90%
as we do.

00:51:56.914 --> 00:52:00.484 align:middle line:84%
We occur -- we exist
in all spectrums

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:03.086 align:middle line:84%
of dimensionality
as do gemstones.

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:05.756 align:middle line:84%
And so gemstones --
there's certain gemstones

00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:09.359 align:middle line:84%
that really help you in
which you might det- --

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:15.599 align:middle line:84%
call meditation, astral travel,
bilocation, and the ability

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:19.970 align:middle line:84%
to be aware of higher self and
at the same time stay grounded.

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:24.575 align:middle line:84%
That is the color
change Spessartite Garnet

00:52:24.575 --> 00:52:25.842 align:middle line:90%
and the Alexandrite.

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.446 align:middle line:84%
>> James: the Alexandrite's
are way expensive.

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.048 align:middle line:90%
$30,000 a carat now.

00:52:31.048 --> 00:52:32.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh my.

00:52:32.115 --> 00:52:33.317 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Because
they're just so rare.

00:52:33.317 --> 00:52:34.384 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:52:34.384 --> 00:52:36.687 align:middle line:84%
>> James: But they
go from a teal green,

00:52:36.687 --> 00:52:41.325 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful teal green to
purple and they're astonishing.

00:52:41.325 --> 00:52:42.392 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh.

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:44.294 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now in
ancient times the Pharos

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:45.896 align:middle line:90%
and such always had these

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:50.467 align:middle line:84%
such incredible stones
embedded in their head ware.

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:51.168 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Right.

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:51.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: For example.

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:52.703 align:middle line:90%
And that was for purpose.

00:52:52.703 --> 00:52:53.637 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Absolutely.

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:54.638 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: that wasn't
for vanity

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:55.739 align:middle line:84%
and Lapis Lazuli
played large, as well.

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.207 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Lapis Lazuli, Ruby.

00:52:57.207 --> 00:52:57.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Ruby.

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.343 align:middle line:90%
>> James: And Amethyst.

00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:02.179 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you watch the
television series  The Tudors .

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:03.413 align:middle line:90%
There was...

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:04.414 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No, I haven't.

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.382 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Oh my.

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:06.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Everyone
says it's good.

00:53:06.183 --> 00:53:06.950 align:middle line:90%
I just haven't gotten there.

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.517 align:middle line:90%
>> James: It's brilliant.

00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:08.619 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:53:08.619 --> 00:53:09.853 align:middle line:84%
>> James: But one of
the most amazing things

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:13.056 align:middle line:84%
about it is the way
that they show all

00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:18.328 align:middle line:84%
of the royals wearing
these incredible...

00:53:18.328 --> 00:53:19.596 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Gems.

00:53:19.596 --> 00:53:24.835 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Gems and gold
chains that were heavy and all

00:53:24.835 --> 00:53:29.506 align:middle line:84%
of the kings, all of the
royals had the crowns,

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:37.180 align:middle line:84%
had the choker necklaces and the
heavy gold draping ornamental

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.518 align:middle line:84%
medals that they wore
as part of their office.

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:46.490 align:middle line:84%
If they were a bishop,
if they were a secretary

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:47.557 align:middle line:90%
within the court.

00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:50.961 align:middle line:84%
All the corazones had
identifying chains

00:53:50.961 --> 00:53:54.498 align:middle line:84%
that were an inch in
thickness and looked

00:53:54.498 --> 00:53:57.000 align:middle line:84%
like they probably weighed
a kilo laden with gemstones.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.468 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And still
in the church.

00:53:58.468 --> 00:53:59.169 align:middle line:90%
>> James; And...

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:00.437 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:01.271 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Some in the church,
some in the government.

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:02.673 align:middle line:90%
And the church still does that.

00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:08.612 align:middle line:84%
The czars, the pope's, the
pharos always wore gemstones.

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:10.213 align:middle line:90%
The Ruby has been recognized

00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:13.150 align:middle line:84%
since ancient days
as a strength giver.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:17.788 align:middle line:84%
And the other piece about
maintaining the auric field

00:54:17.788 --> 00:54:23.727 align:middle line:84%
in great stability is that
when you have an auric field

00:54:23.727 --> 00:54:25.662 align:middle line:90%
that is stable, that operates

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:29.766 align:middle line:84%
at the appropriate circuitry you
can increase the level of energy

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:33.537 align:middle line:84%
that you carry within it so
that you don't go to places

00:54:33.537 --> 00:54:36.206 align:middle line:84%
where there is a differential
interruption will occur.

00:54:36.206 --> 00:54:38.942 align:middle line:84%
If you stay in Sedona long
enough and you're able

00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:43.914 align:middle line:84%
to not become eccentric, not
lose -- not get caught up in ego

00:54:43.914 --> 00:54:46.283 align:middle line:84%
or not get caught
up in the other end

00:54:46.283 --> 00:54:50.587 align:middle line:84%
of depression then you
will develop an auric field

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:54.191 align:middle line:84%
that is stronger and
carries a tremendous field.

00:54:54.191 --> 00:54:55.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:54:55.325 --> 00:54:56.727 align:middle line:84%
>> James: But you still
have to maintain that.

00:54:56.727 --> 00:55:00.797 align:middle line:84%
But when you carry that higher
capacitor, that higher capacity

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:03.900 align:middle line:84%
within the auric
capacitor you are able

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:07.637 align:middle line:84%
to manifest your
reality more effectively.

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:08.839 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> James: And that is how
gemstones play a role.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.543 align:middle line:84%
They are energy batteries
that allow you

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:17.114 align:middle line:84%
to keep you auric field
intact and create your life.

00:55:17.114 --> 00:55:19.549 align:middle line:84%
People say 2012 has
come and gone.

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:20.684 align:middle line:90%
What's next?

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:25.021 align:middle line:84%
What's next is we have
to co-create the earth.

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:28.191 align:middle line:84%
We see so many things around
us that need changing.

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:31.328 align:middle line:84%
We see elementary
school massacres.

00:55:31.328 --> 00:55:34.097 align:middle line:84%
We see people who
can't get medical care.

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:37.601 align:middle line:84%
We see many things in North
America that need changing.

00:55:37.601 --> 00:55:39.002 align:middle line:90%
So how do we do it?

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:43.673 align:middle line:84%
We aggressively join together
and meditate toward highest good

00:55:43.673 --> 00:55:47.077 align:middle line:84%
and when we carry an intact
aura the ability to go

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:52.182 align:middle line:84%
into coherent theta, because of
gemstones as our stabilizers,

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:55.085 align:middle line:84%
allows us to join
together and co-create.

00:55:55.085 --> 00:55:57.187 align:middle line:84%
The Rand Corporation
out of California,

00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:00.791 align:middle line:84%
one of the most respect
auditing think tanks

00:56:00.791 --> 00:56:05.762 align:middle line:84%
in the world absolutely
confirmed that in a test done

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:10.467 align:middle line:84%
in the early-2000's when 700
people mediated together toward

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:13.603 align:middle line:84%
lessening crime that the
crime rate absolutely...

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:14.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:15.005 align:middle line:90%
>> James: ...was reduced.

00:56:15.005 --> 00:56:16.339 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:19.176 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Imagine what can
happen when we have thousands

00:56:19.176 --> 00:56:23.513 align:middle line:84%
of people meditating
together toward world peace.

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:24.381 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:25.449 align:middle line:90%
>> James: And highest good.

00:56:25.449 --> 00:56:26.683 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Absolutely
and I have one --

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:27.751 align:middle line:90%
I have a question in here.

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:29.553 align:middle line:84%
Now we only have about
five minutes left.

00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:31.221 align:middle line:84%
Let's take this in
reverse for a moment.

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:33.356 align:middle line:84%
Less people think
this is not important.

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:34.424 align:middle line:90%
>> James: Right.

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:35.759 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's talk
about what happens

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:38.295 align:middle line:84%
when your aura is thinned
out, drained, and shot through

00:56:38.295 --> 00:56:40.197 align:middle line:90%
and through, full of holes.

00:56:40.197 --> 00:56:43.266 align:middle line:84%
This is as important as
the skin on your body.

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:47.037 align:middle line:84%
>> James: You -- that's an
absolutely excellent question

00:56:47.037 --> 00:56:48.238 align:middle line:90%
and a valid point.

00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:51.475 align:middle line:84%
It is our etheric body,
it is our spiritual body,

00:56:51.475 --> 00:56:55.212 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't maintain
it you will bleed energy.

00:56:55.212 --> 00:56:58.815 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot
of things that do --

00:56:58.815 --> 00:57:01.818 align:middle line:84%
that we have to be aware of that
we talk about on the website.

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:04.888 align:middle line:84%
Micro -- you know, cell
phones, a lot of times in front

00:57:04.888 --> 00:57:08.758 align:middle line:84%
of laptop and I recommend stones
that help counter that; Malecite

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:13.630 align:middle line:84%
and Meteorite actually will
deflect the field of a laptop.

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.932 align:middle line:84%
But if you allow
your auric field

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.767 align:middle line:84%
to deplete it will
affect your health.

00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:22.405 align:middle line:84%
It is the core source
of all disease.

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:26.109 align:middle line:84%
Whether it leads to just chronic
fatigue, whether it just leads

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:30.113 align:middle line:84%
to emotional highs
and lows or anxieties.

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:33.316 align:middle line:84%
Depending if the rupture
-- how deep it is.

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:37.387 align:middle line:84%
You absolutely must
take the responsibility

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:42.959 align:middle line:84%
of maintaining your auric
field in order to be integral.

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.561 align:middle line:90%
In order to be whole.

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:47.664 align:middle line:84%
In order to be a
creator of your life.

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And what is the purpose of
life according to Metatron?

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:54.337 align:middle line:84%
To learn how to be a
responsible creator.

00:57:54.337 --> 00:57:55.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:57:55.505 --> 00:57:59.142 align:middle line:84%
Okay we have just a
couple minutes left now.

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.977 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to
talk a little bit more

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:02.045 align:middle line:90%
about sacred spots.

00:58:02.045 --> 00:58:03.647 align:middle line:90%
There are so many lovely spots.

00:58:03.647 --> 00:58:05.582 align:middle line:84%
But now you're down
to a bullet list.

00:58:05.582 --> 00:58:08.418 align:middle line:84%
Give us a bullet list now if
we have some vacation money

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:12.188 align:middle line:84%
and we're drawn to
some of the top sites

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:13.957 align:middle line:84%
in the world right now
in terms of potency.

00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:15.358 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Well I'll
speak about the ones --

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:17.527 align:middle line:84%
we do two pilgrimages
a year and I'll talk

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.729 align:middle line:90%
about the one we just returned

00:58:19.729 --> 00:58:22.832 align:middle line:84%
from Los Torres del
Piney in southern Chile.

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:27.037 align:middle line:84%
Patagonia, Chile is
absolutely amazing.

00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:30.206 align:middle line:84%
It is a massive,
off of the Andes.

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:32.242 align:middle line:90%
It is beautiful.

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:38.381 align:middle line:84%
It has -- it looks a
lot like Vampth, Canada.

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:39.482 align:middle line:90%
>> [Multiple speakers].

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.451 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Just returned
from Easter Island.

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:43.119 align:middle line:90%
Amazing place.

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.387 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Lemurian.

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> James: Lemurian, called
the navel of the world.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.558 align:middle line:90%
It is on the precession

00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:52.329 align:middle line:84%
of the equinoxes
according to Graham Hancock.

00:58:52.329 --> 00:58:53.496 align:middle line:90%
[Inaudible], stunning.

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:56.566 align:middle line:84%
We are about to take a
group to the other navel

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:59.135 align:middle line:90%
of the world, Delphi, Greece.

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:01.338 align:middle line:84%
And it is interesting
they're both

00:59:01.338 --> 00:59:02.906 align:middle line:84%
on the procession
of the equinox.

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:05.609 align:middle line:84%
There's one is southern
hemisphere,

00:59:05.609 --> 00:59:06.876 align:middle line:84%
[Background Music]
one is northern.

00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.478 align:middle line:90%
And of course Ireland.

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:13.450 align:middle line:84%
The U.K. is just shock full
of amazing energy places

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.853 align:middle line:84%
from Rosalyn Chapel which
is one of the most...

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:17.988 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:59:17.988 --> 00:59:18.788 align:middle line:84%
>> James: ...powerful
centers on the planet.

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:19.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I've been there.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.757 align:middle line:90%
>> James: To Glastonbury.

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:21.791 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [inaudible]...

00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:22.626 align:middle line:84%
>> James: The 51st
parallel goes right

00:59:22.626 --> 00:59:25.462 align:middle line:90%
through so many of these places.

00:59:25.462 --> 00:59:30.133 align:middle line:84%
