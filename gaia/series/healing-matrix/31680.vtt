[Music_]

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.992 align:middle line:84%
>>Regina Meredith: We've
all seen the movies

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:37.322 align:middle line:84%
and read the books where
the American or English girl

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:40.297 align:middle line:84%
goes to Italy or Spain and falls
for the love of their lives.

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:43.033 align:middle line:84%
It's such a common theme
that it's become a cliche,

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.569 align:middle line:84%
but cliches generally
have an underlying truth.

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.109 align:middle line:84%
So what is it that has
become out of balance

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.674 align:middle line:84%
in our society that sends us
looking for something other

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:53.243 align:middle line:84%
than in terms of
romantic partners?

00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Andre Villa would say it's
because we've lost our template

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.735 align:middle line:90%
for becoming men and women.

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:00.199 align:middle line:84%
Andrea works with youth
in helping them find

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.418 align:middle line:90%
their strength and courage.

00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:03.087 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for
joining us today.

00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:05.754 align:middle line:84%
This is an interesting
conversation and one that's

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:07.091 align:middle line:90%
uncomfortable for some people.

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:11.028 align:middle line:84%
We tried so hard to get this
politically correct androgenous

00:01:11.028 --> 00:01:12.882 align:middle line:84%
thing going that
we've succeeded.

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:15.299 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of problems
that are coming out of it.

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.835 align:middle line:84%
So before we even
get into all of that,

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:20.771 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about your own
youth, because you were raised

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:23.207 align:middle line:84%
in Italy, you had maybe
a different template

00:01:23.207 --> 00:01:26.047 align:middle line:84%
than an American
had in the way you

00:01:26.047 --> 00:01:29.613 align:middle line:84%
were raised and coming into
your manhood as a young fellow.

00:01:29.613 --> 00:01:33.029 align:middle line:84%
And also questioning
the system that you were

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:35.219 align:middle line:84%
plugged into, in
terms of education.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.287 align:middle line:90%
So tell us about yourself.

00:01:37.287 --> 00:01:40.586 align:middle line:84%
>> Andrea Villa: Well, I think
the most important thing that I

00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:44.428 align:middle line:84%
was blessed with, an
extended family --

00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:46.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Extended
families are huge, right.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Andrea Villa: Correct.

00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:53.904 align:middle line:84%
There was the grandfathers
present in my life,

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:56.373 align:middle line:84%
especially when I
was a young kid.

00:01:56.373 --> 00:02:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were sort of the
custodian of the family lore

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.315 align:middle line:84%
and the custodian of the
heroic struggle of my family,

00:02:05.315 --> 00:02:08.952 align:middle line:84%
with invasions, Germans
every twenty years or so,

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:12.189 align:middle line:84%
seems they like to vacation
with their arms in Italy.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of disruption and
acts of heroism and so forth.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.364 align:middle line:84%
So I really grew up with a
real sense of where I was from.

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:24.802 align:middle line:84%
All this story telling
around the kitchen

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:30.341 align:middle line:84%
table, all these questions,
boys are very, very curious.

00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So this one element,
the other element

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.114 align:middle line:84%
that was I was really
blessed, I think, was nature.

00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:42.653 align:middle line:84%
I really, you know, I was --
we wanted to spend time out.

00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:47.396 align:middle line:84%
So that allowed me to
have spent hours in,

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:51.394 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the river,
on the river canyon,

00:02:51.394 --> 00:02:53.497 align:middle line:90%
and territory belonged to kids.

00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:57.368 align:middle line:84%
And so there was
this element, we

00:02:57.368 --> 00:03:00.686 align:middle line:84%
were not supervised
so we have to sort

00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:02.673 align:middle line:90%
of like, deal with each other.

00:03:02.673 --> 00:03:06.410 align:middle line:84%
So there was no, like,
a little league play,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.869 align:middle line:84%
where the uniform, the games,
the referees and games,

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.849 align:middle line:90%
intervention of the adults.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.299 align:middle line:84%
We had to settle
and negotiate out

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.285 align:middle line:84%
of the scrapes we
were getting into,

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:17.755 align:middle line:90%
and a boy will get into scrapes.

00:03:17.755 --> 00:03:21.724 align:middle line:84%
So it was this element, and
the third element that we had,

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:23.227 align:middle line:90%
it was nature.

00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:27.698 align:middle line:84%
And nature really I
think when you belong,

00:03:27.698 --> 00:03:31.235 align:middle line:84%
where you really develop
a sense of belonging,

00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:35.739 align:middle line:84%
and it is basically where you
get your spiritual education.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.078 align:middle line:84%
So I think those three elements,
they were very, very strong

00:03:41.078 --> 00:03:43.334 align:middle line:84%
and that is one of
the first things

00:03:43.334 --> 00:03:46.233 align:middle line:84%
that you notice when you
come to this country,

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:48.501 align:middle line:84%
especially when you
notice that, you know,

00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:51.421 align:middle line:84%
the parents, the grandfathers
are playing golf in Florida.

00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:56.827 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
something that is a problem

00:03:56.827 --> 00:03:58.394 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It is a problem.

00:03:58.394 --> 00:04:02.452 align:middle line:84%
As you were saying earlier,
these heroic stories

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:06.850 align:middle line:84%
are what you and your brothers
and your cousins and everyone

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.304 align:middle line:84%
were raised on, and
yet the storyteller

00:04:09.304 --> 00:04:10.507 align:middle line:90%
was the grandfather.

00:04:10.507 --> 00:04:15.546 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about how
you perceived your grandfather

00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:17.905 align:middle line:84%
at that time, how
the grandfathers were

00:04:17.905 --> 00:04:19.583 align:middle line:90%
perceived within the family.

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:21.919 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: You know, what's
what I learned from them,

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.475 align:middle line:84%
they're all mentorship,
which is another figure

00:04:25.475 --> 00:04:28.358 align:middle line:84%
that's disappearing in the
culture of this course.

00:04:28.358 --> 00:04:32.129 align:middle line:84%
Mentors really is
what is -- as a role,

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.197 align:middle line:84%
it's really interesting, not so
much for you to become a doctor

00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:37.935 align:middle line:84%
or an engineer but about
you becoming a good person.

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:39.937 align:middle line:84%
You can only become
a good person

00:04:39.937 --> 00:04:42.739 align:middle line:84%
by becoming the you
that is living there.

00:04:42.739 --> 00:04:47.896 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of time spent
with my grandfathers

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:50.447 align:middle line:84%
is questions, you know, what
do you think about this.

00:04:50.447 --> 00:04:53.795 align:middle line:84%
He was asking questions
of me more than I

00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:84%
a question of him,
especially one grandfather.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So it was really like -- it
was really drawing me out with

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.597 align:middle line:84%
a process of inquiries, it
wasn't telling me this is

00:05:01.597 --> 00:05:03.927 align:middle line:84%
right, this is wrong,
like my father would do.

00:05:03.927 --> 00:05:05.963 align:middle line:84%
Because my father
is more concerning,

00:05:05.963 --> 00:05:08.959 align:middle line:90%
you know, getting it straight.

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:11.001 align:middle line:84%
Grandfathers are more
concerned with who you are.

00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:13.225 align:middle line:84%
I think this was
the gift, and it's

00:05:13.225 --> 00:05:16.073 align:middle line:84%
kind of role modelling I try
to do when I work with my kids,

00:05:16.073 --> 00:05:19.798 align:middle line:84%
you know it's not about
me telling them, dumping

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:24.281 align:middle line:84%
on them what I know, just
drawing what is there already.

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:27.134 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what has
happened in our society,

00:05:27.134 --> 00:05:29.953 align:middle line:84%
in the west and in
America in particular,

00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:33.257 align:middle line:84%
there's become this huge
disconnect , almost a --

00:05:33.257 --> 00:05:36.727 align:middle line:84%
kind of a self serving quality
when people reach the years

00:05:36.727 --> 00:05:38.662 align:middle line:84%
where they become
grandparents, which is oh,

00:05:38.662 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:90%
I'm done with all of that.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm out of here, and the
breaking up of family.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.704 align:middle line:84%
I too see this as something
that's had a devastating effect

00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:47.504 align:middle line:90%
on all of us.

00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:50.821 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what about -- what
about the person growing older

00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:52.676 align:middle line:84%
themselves, not so
have that connection?

00:05:52.676 --> 00:05:57.699 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: There's a sense of
rootedness that you get if you

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:01.385 align:middle line:84%
connected with your
elders that is --

00:06:01.385 --> 00:06:06.023 align:middle line:84%
there's no money that can
pay for it, you know, it's --

00:06:06.023 --> 00:06:08.354 align:middle line:84%
it really provides a
sense of rootedness,

00:06:08.354 --> 00:06:10.227 align:middle line:84%
a sense of belonging
to something.

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:12.496 align:middle line:84%
When I'm in my hometown
I know where I come from,

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:15.065 align:middle line:84%
I know the rocks, I
know the territory,

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:16.900 align:middle line:84%
I know what happened
there and then.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.004 align:middle line:84%
So there is a sense
walking the street

00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.939 align:middle line:84%
it's different from anybody
living in this country.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:25.638 align:middle line:84%
And when I work
with the boys I do

00:06:25.638 --> 00:06:30.412 align:middle line:84%
try to get to an experience
of rootedness in life >> RM:

00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:31.281 align:middle line:90%
Rootedness, right

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.785 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Because that gives the
energy and the power to deal

00:06:34.785 --> 00:06:36.453 align:middle line:90%
with the complexities.

00:06:36.453 --> 00:06:38.829 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We were talking
off camera about this,

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:41.081 align:middle line:84%
and I'll get into this
part of the conversation,

00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:45.236 align:middle line:84%
but the whole role of boys and
girls in Italy is defined very

00:06:45.236 --> 00:06:48.098 align:middle line:84%
differently than growing up in
the United States, for example.

00:06:48.098 --> 00:06:49.869 align:middle line:84%
And I'll just use
those two countries,

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.703 align:middle line:84%
we're all various, you know,
iterations of it in between.

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:55.524 align:middle line:84%
But the subject
of the girls being

00:06:55.524 --> 00:07:00.919 align:middle line:84%
able to be in themselves
kind of joyful and flirty,

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.949 align:middle line:84%
and they can take up space with
their own being, so to speak.

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.024 align:middle line:84%
More in Italy, you see this in
Italy where the girls in the US

00:07:09.024 --> 00:07:11.355 align:middle line:84%
are more like this,
with eyes cast down

00:07:11.355 --> 00:07:12.594 align:middle line:90%
and there's more fear.

00:07:12.594 --> 00:07:14.469 align:middle line:84%
And when we were talking
off camera about it,

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:17.728 align:middle line:84%
you were saying because this
knowledge passed back and forth

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.831 align:middle line:84%
between the grandfather, the
grandfather to the father

00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:24.134 align:middle line:84%
and to the son and out to the
cousins is you have to behave

00:07:24.134 --> 00:07:27.270 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way and
you don't essentially --

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.774 align:middle line:84%
I say molest in the Spanish
sense of the word --

00:07:30.774 --> 00:07:33.411 align:middle line:84%
these girls, you don't bother
these girls in an inappropriate

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.211 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:37.014 align:middle line:84%
So they're free to just grow up
and be beautiful young women.

00:07:37.014 --> 00:07:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: This is one of the first
things you notice when you go

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.687 align:middle line:84%
-- when I went back to
-- went back to Italy,

00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:48.625 align:middle line:84%
is when I visit there that the
women look at you, and here,

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:50.427 align:middle line:84%
it never happens,
never look at you.

00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:52.903 align:middle line:84%
Because there's the sense
that if they look at you

00:07:52.903 --> 00:07:54.674 align:middle line:84%
they're inviting you
in a conversation,

00:07:54.674 --> 00:07:55.632 align:middle line:90%
they're inviting you --

00:07:55.632 --> 00:07:57.099 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They feel unsafe.

00:07:57.099 --> 00:07:58.902 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Correct,
they feel unsafe.

00:07:58.902 --> 00:08:03.982 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in Italy they look
at you with appreciation.

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:07.608 align:middle line:84%
A handsome man is walking
by, that was interesting,

00:08:07.608 --> 00:08:09.479 align:middle line:90%
and I got a look at you.

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:11.581 align:middle line:84%
I feel safe enough, and
it doesn't mean anything.

00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:14.017 align:middle line:84%
It means, like, oh,
I acknowledge you,

00:08:14.017 --> 00:08:15.185 align:middle line:90%
acknowledge as I pass by.

00:08:15.185 --> 00:08:20.086 align:middle line:84%
And this is very -- it's very
-- jumps to your eyes the moment

00:08:20.086 --> 00:08:23.693 align:middle line:84%
you get to Italy, this sense
of women are much more safe.

00:08:23.693 --> 00:08:25.462 align:middle line:90%
Also because they're protected.

00:08:25.462 --> 00:08:27.531 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Talk about
that for a moment,

00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:33.537 align:middle line:84%
that's part of what the
men pass on to each other.

00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:34.938 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely.

00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:39.976 align:middle line:84%
How shall we say this, you know,
I do this work with initiation,

00:08:39.976 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
and I think one of
the first initiation

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.979 align:middle line:84%
is going to ask the lady out,
and they have to go and shake

00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:49.052 align:middle line:90%
the hands of the father.

00:08:49.052 --> 00:08:52.580 align:middle line:84%
The father knows exactly
well what you're up to,

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.794 align:middle line:84%
so he's going to make sure
that you shake hands with him

00:08:57.794 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:90%
and he's going to be present.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.088 align:middle line:84%
So if anything
wrong happens, see,

00:09:03.088 --> 00:09:08.198 align:middle line:84%
when I was growing up there
was a lot of hanky panky going

00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:12.459 align:middle line:84%
on -- but no trouble, because
I know there was any trouble I

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:14.745 align:middle line:90%
would be a dead man.

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:15.648 align:middle line:90%
Either the father --

00:09:15.648 --> 00:09:17.981 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The brothers would
come after you or your father.

00:09:17.981 --> 00:09:20.517 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: So that create a lot
of safety for the women,

00:09:20.517 --> 00:09:25.747 align:middle line:84%
but also makes me be very
clear I'm committed to this

00:09:25.747 --> 00:09:27.791 align:middle line:90%
relationship or not.

00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:31.839 align:middle line:84%
So you know, courtship is
another rite of passage

00:09:31.839 --> 00:09:33.797 align:middle line:90%
that's gone, passed by.

00:09:33.797 --> 00:09:37.968 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's come very
easy for the boys and girls

00:09:37.968 --> 00:09:41.104 align:middle line:84%
to get together without
really the consequences

00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:42.439 align:middle line:90%
that in the old days.

00:09:42.439 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Courting ritual is a very
important part of village life.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:52.015 align:middle line:84%
Got to make sure the guy is
Good enough and proving himself

00:09:52.015 --> 00:09:53.817 align:middle line:84%
so he can spend
time with the girl.

00:09:53.817 --> 00:10:01.858 align:middle line:84%
It's also something that in some
society involves very complex

00:10:01.858 --> 00:10:05.929 align:middle line:84%
ritual and going to
debt in order to --

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:09.432 align:middle line:84%
for you to afford a
relationship with a woman,

00:10:09.432 --> 00:10:11.961 align:middle line:84%
and this debt is supported
by your community

00:10:11.961 --> 00:10:12.836 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Debt, you say?

00:10:12.836 --> 00:10:13.636 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Yeah.

00:10:13.636 --> 00:10:14.471 align:middle line:90%
Debt, yeah.

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:17.396 align:middle line:84%
So your community
makes sure, your family

00:10:17.396 --> 00:10:22.860 align:middle line:84%
makes sure you're supported in
doing this new adventure which

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.548 align:middle line:90%
is the creation of new life.

00:10:24.548 --> 00:10:27.517 align:middle line:90%
So the old, very ritualized.

00:10:27.517 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I won't say in Italy
was very ritualized,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.759 align:middle line:84%
but there was definitely an
awareness of who I'm dating

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:39.262 align:middle line:84%
and what I'm dating is part
of a bigger conversation.

00:10:39.262 --> 00:10:41.765 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And involves as
you say the community,

00:10:41.765 --> 00:10:45.435 align:middle line:84%
the entire family's support,
and agreement on some level.

00:10:45.435 --> 00:10:47.011 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
there are some people

00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.469 align:middle line:84%
listening who would
say, yeah, well

00:10:48.469 --> 00:10:50.384 align:middle line:84%
isn't that why people
who are in America

00:10:50.384 --> 00:10:52.521 align:middle line:84%
left Europe, for example,
so you didn't have

00:10:52.521 --> 00:10:54.144 align:middle line:90%
to be tied to these traditions.

00:10:54.144 --> 00:10:57.881 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that has been
a trade off or do you see this,

00:10:57.881 --> 00:11:00.102 align:middle line:84%
it's simply been a decline
in the social fabric?

00:11:00.102 --> 00:11:02.185 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: You know, when I
talk about it, this thing,

00:11:02.185 --> 00:11:05.355 align:middle line:84%
I'm always a pessimist, and
then when the work with the boys

00:11:05.355 --> 00:11:08.291 align:middle line:84%
or the girls I become
an optimist, you know?

00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:12.155 align:middle line:90%
When I see -- yes, it is --

00:11:12.155 --> 00:11:16.553 align:middle line:84%
I was saying that the
-- the casualty of sex,

00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:20.237 align:middle line:84%
the way the young people
approach sex is a terrible

00:11:20.237 --> 00:11:21.037 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:24.307 align:middle line:84%
It's a terrible thing not
from a moralistic, prudishness

00:11:24.307 --> 00:11:30.046 align:middle line:84%
on my part, but the fact that
easy sex keeps a boy a boy.

00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:32.816 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, that's a large
conversation I wanted to get

00:11:32.816 --> 00:11:37.317 align:middle line:84%
into that also is tied to
social events such as initially

00:11:37.317 --> 00:11:40.691 align:middle line:84%
the sexual revolution in the
United States and throughout

00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:41.491 align:middle line:90%
the west.

00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:46.830 align:middle line:90%
That's a big conversation.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Yeah, it's a very
big conversation, it's --

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.441 align:middle line:84%
and again, we -- we -- because
we went away from our ritual

00:11:55.441 --> 00:11:58.333 align:middle line:84%
conversation about this
human relationship, you know,

00:11:58.333 --> 00:11:59.809 align:middle line:90%
rite of passage and so forth.

00:11:59.809 --> 00:12:03.246 align:middle line:84%
There's a -- you know, in your
teens there's a Great Awakening

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:07.918 align:middle line:84%
that happens, and for
women, it's about --

00:12:07.918 --> 00:12:11.788 align:middle line:84%
for the girls it's about love,
they really awaken to love.

00:12:11.788 --> 00:12:14.357 align:middle line:84%
And for the boy
there's an awakening

00:12:14.357 --> 00:12:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to love but there's also
an awakening to purpose

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.196 align:middle line:84%
or their own gift
they're carrying.

00:12:20.196 --> 00:12:23.376 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
both of these gifts

00:12:23.376 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:84%
are totally ignored by
society, and they're

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.975 align:middle line:84%
ignored because there's
usually no room for them.

00:12:31.975 --> 00:12:35.478 align:middle line:84%
There's no room for the
love that girls awaken to,

00:12:35.478 --> 00:12:38.682 align:middle line:84%
and there's no room for the
boys, the purpose the boys

00:12:38.682 --> 00:12:39.482 align:middle line:90%
awaken to.

00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Think in these terms, what
we have now is an educational

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.360 align:middle line:84%
system that is not an
educational system, it's a --

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.163 align:middle line:90%
is an instructional system

00:12:53.163 --> 00:12:55.332 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Almost factory
farming of brains.

00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:56.533 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Correct.

00:12:56.533 --> 00:13:00.498 align:middle line:84%
It's been designed by Napoleon
because he wanted to have

00:13:00.498 --> 00:13:02.906 align:middle line:90%
bureaucrats to run and empire.

00:13:02.906 --> 00:13:08.011 align:middle line:84%
So what happened is -- so you
need, like, continuing grade,

00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:13.297 align:middle line:84%
pass, grade, a progression,
so you need predictability,

00:13:13.297 --> 00:13:15.385 align:middle line:90%
uniformity, conformity, right?

00:13:15.385 --> 00:13:17.754 align:middle line:84%
But it's not about
educating everybody,

00:13:17.754 --> 00:13:21.128 align:middle line:84%
it's about opening
the brain and throwing

00:13:21.128 --> 00:13:26.284 align:middle line:84%
in instructions and
knowledge, technical knowledge

00:13:26.284 --> 00:13:29.432 align:middle line:90%
in the brains.

00:13:29.432 --> 00:13:31.784 align:middle line:84%
Just a strip mining,
somebody defining

00:13:31.784 --> 00:13:34.137 align:middle line:90%
strip mining of the brain.

00:13:34.137 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:84%
What it really education
means, it means "educe",

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.344 align:middle line:84%
it's a Latin word, it
literally means lead out,

00:13:41.344 --> 00:13:44.247 align:middle line:84%
which is really what my
grandfather used to do.

00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:48.918 align:middle line:84%
Lead my true self out, and
asking all these questions,

00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:53.590 align:middle line:84%
creating all these situations
for me to really experiment

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.628 align:middle line:84%
and practice my -- the bigger
self that was living inside.

00:13:58.628 --> 00:14:01.231 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
was really interesting.

00:14:01.231 --> 00:14:07.237 align:middle line:84%
So we live in this world that
so -- by the time that we --

00:14:07.237 --> 00:14:10.347 align:middle line:84%
we have this magical moment
in which really they're about

00:14:10.347 --> 00:14:13.286 align:middle line:84%
to -- ready to share their
gifts with the world,

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:14.444 align:middle line:90%
love and purpose --

00:14:14.444 --> 00:14:17.046 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What age group
does this start surfacing?

00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:18.515 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: 12.

00:14:18.515 --> 00:14:19.315 align:middle line:90%
12.

00:14:19.315 --> 00:14:23.119 align:middle line:84%
We -- society is
feeling unprepared,

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:26.131 align:middle line:84%
because society in what--
now we have these tracks that

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:28.726 align:middle line:84%
at the end that is going to make
you an engineer or a doctor,

00:14:28.726 --> 00:14:29.526 align:middle line:90%
or so forth.

00:14:29.526 --> 00:14:31.943 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing wrong with
being an engineer or a doctor,

00:14:31.943 --> 00:14:34.497 align:middle line:84%
we all need these people,
and technicians and so forth.

00:14:34.497 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's not really how
our intelligence develops,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:44.307 align:middle line:84%
it's not really who we
are, it's not our nature.

00:14:44.307 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:84%
What happens, you know, when
we come to this world we have

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:54.984 align:middle line:84%
really -- we come -- our brain
is fully formed, we have --

00:14:54.984 --> 00:14:58.522 align:middle line:84%
this is called the triune
brain, which is divided in three

00:14:58.522 --> 00:14:59.322 align:middle line:90%
parts.

00:14:59.322 --> 00:15:05.962 align:middle line:84%
We have the stem which controls
our more basic, heartbeat,

00:15:05.962 --> 00:15:13.369 align:middle line:84%
the physiological thing,
sexual -- sexual reproduction,

00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:15.872 align:middle line:84%
control of domain of territory
and that kind of stuff,

00:15:15.872 --> 00:15:16.940 align:middle line:90%
which is a bit primitive.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.842 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
reptilian brain, right?

00:15:18.842 --> 00:15:22.426 align:middle line:84%
On top we have the mammalian
brain, the limbic brain which

00:15:22.426 --> 00:15:26.015 align:middle line:84%
we share with mammals,
and it's the seat

00:15:26.015 --> 00:15:28.544 align:middle line:90%
of emotions, deep emotions.

00:15:28.544 --> 00:15:30.086 align:middle line:84%
On top of that we
have the neo cortex

00:15:30.086 --> 00:15:32.388 align:middle line:90%
of the full frontal lobes.

00:15:32.388 --> 00:15:33.598 align:middle line:90%
So we come fully formed.

00:15:33.598 --> 00:15:37.286 align:middle line:84%
However, the connections between
these brains happens through

00:15:37.286 --> 00:15:39.662 align:middle line:90%
educations, happens through --

00:15:39.662 --> 00:15:40.897 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Experience.

00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:46.069 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Experience, yeah,
play, story telling, nature.

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:49.172 align:middle line:84%
So in the first
phase, literally,

00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:53.676 align:middle line:84%
the brain grows this --
these neurons to connect,

00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:55.979 align:middle line:84%
to create the corrections
between one part of the brain

00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:56.779 align:middle line:90%
and the next.

00:15:56.779 --> 00:16:02.973 align:middle line:84%
So when we are just babies,
it's a basic instinct then

00:16:02.973 --> 00:16:08.191 align:middle line:84%
we go to more complex,
more complex function

00:16:08.191 --> 00:16:10.093 align:middle line:84%
with the limbic
system and so forth.

00:16:10.093 --> 00:16:12.911 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So what's happening at
that magical age of puberty,

00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:13.764 align:middle line:90%
12, roughly?

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:15.431 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Correct, that's
the magic moment.

00:16:15.431 --> 00:16:17.400 align:middle line:84%
That's the magic
moment because we --

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.738 align:middle line:84%
the limbic brain and the
reptilian brain are integrated.

00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:25.635 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
this -- by the way,

00:16:25.635 --> 00:16:28.273 align:middle line:84%
remember that this
happens in burst,

00:16:28.273 --> 00:16:32.749 align:middle line:84%
there is a big burst and then
the consolidation happens,

00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:35.552 align:middle line:84%
and also the destruction
of things we don't use.

00:16:35.552 --> 00:16:41.124 align:middle line:84%
So for limbic, from reptilian
to limbic, to frontal lobes.

00:16:41.124 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
Frontal lobes is the
seat of our thinking.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.891 align:middle line:84%
That happens when
you're 12 years old,

00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:48.766 align:middle line:84%
and it's a process that lasts
about til about your early

00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:49.566 align:middle line:90%
20's.

00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:52.267 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And this is a very
delicate and profound process

00:16:52.267 --> 00:16:56.662 align:middle line:84%
involving all of the master
glands within the brain that

00:16:56.662 --> 00:17:01.353 align:middle line:84%
are now disconnected from all
of the things that stimulate it,

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:05.347 align:middle line:84%
i.e, touch, sound, light,
nature, all of these things.

00:17:05.347 --> 00:17:07.917 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:12.622 align:middle line:84%
That's when I was talking about
in Italy this ability to play,

00:17:12.622 --> 00:17:18.349 align:middle line:84%
be unsupervised -- crucial to
this development of internal

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.797 align:middle line:84%
architecture, crucial,
absolutely crucial.

00:17:20.797 --> 00:17:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Make the mistakes, need to
negotiate out, create a place ,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.005 align:middle line:84%
games, that develop
the relationship --

00:17:29.005 --> 00:17:30.907 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You establish
your own hierarchy based

00:17:30.907 --> 00:17:33.127 align:middle line:84%
on your personalities,
and you know,

00:17:33.127 --> 00:17:36.849 align:middle line:84%
there are those who end up at
kind of the back of the pack,

00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:39.391 align:middle line:84%
and they carry that around for
a lifetime until they can find

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:90%
some way to breakthrough that.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.128 align:middle line:84%
That's a part of it,
it's a real game,

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:44.887 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you're playing for real.

00:17:44.887 --> 00:17:47.757 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Now they turn to
schools, everybody wins, right?

00:17:47.757 --> 00:17:53.796 align:middle line:84%
There is another pit fall on the
other end, that everybody wins,

00:17:53.796 --> 00:17:55.896 align:middle line:84%
which is not true,
it's another lie,

00:17:55.896 --> 00:17:59.087 align:middle line:84%
you know, sometimes you
win sometimes you lose.

00:17:59.087 --> 00:18:01.504 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Also being here in this
country and looking at this

00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:03.773 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
politically correct,

00:18:03.773 --> 00:18:06.309 align:middle line:84%
you have to do everything in
a politically correct way.

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:09.669 align:middle line:84%
As you say, everyone has
to win, the tables seem

00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:14.951 align:middle line:84%
to be evened out for everyone
so the texture and the contrast

00:18:14.951 --> 00:18:17.854 align:middle line:84%
between I can do this,
I can't do that seems

00:18:17.854 --> 00:18:19.155 align:middle line:90%
to have almost been eliminated.

00:18:19.155 --> 00:18:21.075 align:middle line:84%
How do you test your
boundaries if you

00:18:21.075 --> 00:18:24.383 align:middle line:84%
have none of these
natural factors at all,

00:18:24.383 --> 00:18:27.864 align:middle line:84%
every animal and human
has to go through?

00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:29.399 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:34.355 align:middle line:84%
By the age of 12, 13 years
old, which by the way

00:18:34.355 --> 00:18:38.323 align:middle line:84%
there's a sense in a
teen, boys or girl,

00:18:38.323 --> 00:18:42.445 align:middle line:84%
that they're really meant for
something special, unique.

00:18:42.445 --> 00:18:46.399 align:middle line:84%
We've now been
traumatized, that's really

00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:50.753 align:middle line:84%
the sense of the really
beginning a big adventure.

00:18:50.753 --> 00:18:54.324 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That why they're
drawn toward the really big,

00:18:54.324 --> 00:18:57.460 align:middle line:84%
heroic kinds of stories,
whether it's, you know,

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.525 align:middle line:90%
playing Dragons --

00:18:58.525 --> 00:19:01.798 align:middle line:84%
Dungeons and Dragons or that --
the teen movies with vampires

00:19:01.798 --> 00:19:02.598 align:middle line:90%
--

00:19:02.598 --> 00:19:05.868 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely.

00:19:05.868 --> 00:19:09.677 align:middle line:84%
They are really ready -- the
image I like to use when I

00:19:09.677 --> 00:19:12.642 align:middle line:84%
think of those things, they
are on a space shuttle,

00:19:12.642 --> 00:19:16.112 align:middle line:84%
they're grounded down,
they're ready for lift off.

00:19:16.112 --> 00:19:18.649 align:middle line:84%
Their hormones are kicking
in, they're ready to go --

00:19:18.649 --> 00:19:20.316 align:middle line:84%
they know they're
ready to go somewhere.

00:19:20.316 --> 00:19:23.353 align:middle line:84%
Because the thing is this,
they know this intuitively,

00:19:23.353 --> 00:19:25.955 align:middle line:84%
it's a physiological
fact behind this,

00:19:25.955 --> 00:19:27.356 align:middle line:90%
and this is very important.

00:19:27.356 --> 00:19:32.462 align:middle line:90%
We use 2% of our neo cortex, 2%.

00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:37.034 align:middle line:84%
They know the age, they
are going for the 100%.

00:19:37.034 --> 00:19:38.201 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Until we squash them.

00:19:38.201 --> 00:19:40.002 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Until we squash them.

00:19:40.002 --> 00:19:41.537 align:middle line:90%
We say, hey, take this pill.

00:19:41.537 --> 00:19:44.841 align:middle line:84%
Fix the little -- you're acting
out now, take some Ritalin,

00:19:44.841 --> 00:19:49.712 align:middle line:84%
take this pill, it
will be all right.

00:19:49.712 --> 00:19:53.664 align:middle line:84%
And so what Ritalin
does, it disconnects you

00:19:53.664 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
from the engine,
from your passion,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.417 align:middle line:84%
from this revolve that
is happening naturally

00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:08.965 align:middle line:84%
That's the -- the tragedy of
modern psychology for kids.

00:20:08.965 --> 00:20:11.969 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are great
psychologists out there,

00:20:11.969 --> 00:20:12.769 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:18.174 align:middle line:84%
But that's -- we medicate
our great transformation

00:20:18.174 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:84%
because nature really
design us for this,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.749 align:middle line:84%
we're really designed
for the big jump.

00:20:26.749 --> 00:20:27.984 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:20:27.984 --> 00:20:31.514 align:middle line:84%
But it can be -- it can
seemingly be out of control,

00:20:31.514 --> 00:20:34.056 align:middle line:84%
out of the parents' control,
the school's control, chaotic --

00:20:34.056 --> 00:20:34.857 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:20:34.857 --> 00:20:35.709 align:middle line:90%
And it is, it is.

00:20:35.709 --> 00:20:37.126 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
bringing the gift,

00:20:37.126 --> 00:20:39.459 align:middle line:84%
they're bringing something
bigger than them, two tracks,

00:20:39.459 --> 00:20:41.574 align:middle line:84%
static, first grade,
second grade, you know,

00:20:41.574 --> 00:20:43.032 align:middle line:84%
intelligence is
bigger than that --

00:20:43.032 --> 00:20:44.532 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Sports,
ballet, and so forth.

00:20:44.532 --> 00:20:44.928 align:middle line:90%


00:20:44.928 --> 00:20:46.803 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Intelligence is
much bigger than this.

00:20:46.803 --> 00:20:51.607 align:middle line:84%
The two tracks -- tracks
are very good for survival,

00:20:51.607 --> 00:20:59.141 align:middle line:84%
you know, very good to produce
stuff, it's absolutely great,

00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:00.516 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing
better than this.

00:21:00.516 --> 00:21:02.183 align:middle line:84%
But it's not good for
human development,

00:21:02.183 --> 00:21:03.386 align:middle line:90%
we don't develop like this.

00:21:03.386 --> 00:21:08.556 align:middle line:84%
We develop in leaps, bounds,
two plus two, two steps forward,

00:21:08.556 --> 00:21:10.359 align:middle line:90%
one step backwards.

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:12.495 align:middle line:90%
That's how we do it, sideways.

00:21:12.495 --> 00:21:15.998 align:middle line:84%
We can't box the
human experience.

00:21:15.998 --> 00:21:20.269 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is you're in
the space shuttle ready to go,

00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:22.872 align:middle line:84%
you know you're meant to go
somewhere, they are right,

00:21:22.872 --> 00:21:26.774 align:middle line:84%
we are wrong, so they're
ready to go somewhere

00:21:26.774 --> 00:21:29.145 align:middle line:90%
and nothing happens.

00:21:29.145 --> 00:21:33.716 align:middle line:84%
So here is the Ritalin and they
start medicating themselves.

00:21:33.716 --> 00:21:36.519 align:middle line:90%
And then there's binge drinking.

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:37.487 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's tragic.

00:21:37.487 --> 00:21:38.254 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Yes, of
course it's tragic.

00:21:38.254 --> 00:21:39.555 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely a tragedy.

00:21:39.555 --> 00:21:42.013 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well then kids have to
find another way to deal with

00:21:42.013 --> 00:21:43.636 align:middle line:84%
that energy that
has been squashed.

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:45.678 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's going to come
out one way or another

00:21:45.678 --> 00:21:48.119 align:middle line:84%
unless you've drugged
them to the extent where

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:50.066 align:middle line:90%
they can't express any more.

00:21:50.066 --> 00:21:52.841 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: And they start heroic
journeys by themselves and they

00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:54.966 align:middle line:84%
share into these gangs or
into these risk behaviors

00:21:54.966 --> 00:22:00.192 align:middle line:84%
and so forth because there's
an element of, you know,

00:22:00.192 --> 00:22:03.661 align:middle line:84%
they belong to themselves,
once they share themselves they

00:22:03.661 --> 00:22:05.214 align:middle line:90%
belong to the tragic.

00:22:05.214 --> 00:22:08.217 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I was having a
conversation just yesterday,

00:22:08.217 --> 00:22:10.979 align:middle line:84%
another interviewee of ours,
and we were talking about

00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:14.523 align:middle line:84%
the prison system, and it
was an extended conversation,

00:22:14.523 --> 00:22:19.495 align:middle line:84%
and he said if there were
a way to embrace the people

00:22:19.495 --> 00:22:23.633 align:middle line:84%
in our prison systems, give them
some pride in themselves back,

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:27.336 align:middle line:84%
these people often have
very high levels of courage.

00:22:27.336 --> 00:22:30.473 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it took to break free
and express themselves even

00:22:30.473 --> 00:22:36.312 align:middle line:84%
in a criminal, harmful
way, very harmful at times,

00:22:36.312 --> 00:22:39.015 align:middle line:84%
but also a certain
element of creativity.

00:22:39.015 --> 00:22:43.152 align:middle line:84%
A lot of criminals -- they know
how to find their way through

00:22:43.152 --> 00:22:44.987 align:middle line:90%
the back alleys of life.

00:22:44.987 --> 00:22:49.592 align:middle line:84%
You're saying the unhealthy
result of squashing those

00:22:49.592 --> 00:22:52.712 align:middle line:84%
normal instincts for a boy
to just burst forward --

00:22:52.712 --> 00:22:55.037 align:middle line:84%
and girls, boys and
girls -- we're talking --

00:22:55.037 --> 00:22:58.134 align:middle line:84%
you mostly work with boys so
for now let's speak about them.

00:22:58.134 --> 00:23:03.272 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: There's a subtle
moment that doesn't happen.

00:23:03.272 --> 00:23:08.068 align:middle line:84%
In the old days, and then
we have all these problems

00:23:08.068 --> 00:23:10.026 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
they have defiance,

00:23:10.026 --> 00:23:14.083 align:middle line:84%
they call it defiance disorder,
it makes me absolutely half.

00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:15.351 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Defiance disorder.

00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:17.019 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: When you
live with this --

00:23:17.019 --> 00:23:19.555 align:middle line:84%
when you live in terms of
defiance it's hell, right?

00:23:19.555 --> 00:23:22.460 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand that this

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.761 align:middle line:84%
is the right place, the
right time, just as a father,

00:23:25.761 --> 00:23:28.898 align:middle line:90%
as a mother, you're exhausted.

00:23:28.898 --> 00:23:31.434 align:middle line:84%
You'll always be the
father and the mother,

00:23:31.434 --> 00:23:33.469 align:middle line:90%
but you've exhausted your roles.

00:23:33.469 --> 00:23:37.645 align:middle line:84%
The person now is ready
for the next step,

00:23:37.645 --> 00:23:41.260 align:middle line:84%
and the next step that
is covered, the next step

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.947 align:middle line:84%
happens to ritual, it's
a ritual experience.

00:23:44.947 --> 00:23:48.851 align:middle line:84%
Not something that's logic, not
something that can be taught,

00:23:48.851 --> 00:23:52.355 align:middle line:84%
no teaching, it's an experience
the person has to undergo.

00:23:52.355 --> 00:23:56.525 align:middle line:84%
And then to reveal
something about themselves.

00:23:56.525 --> 00:24:00.568 align:middle line:84%
So it's that -- so up to now
it's been [INAUDIBLE] about

00:24:00.568 --> 00:24:02.932 align:middle line:90%
as bad as intellect, right?

00:24:02.932 --> 00:24:05.334 align:middle line:84%
We've been in track,
first grade, second grade.

00:24:05.334 --> 00:24:09.572 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going back to a
natural way of learning,

00:24:09.572 --> 00:24:13.542 align:middle line:84%
we're going to an experience,
an experience of a bigger self

00:24:13.542 --> 00:24:14.877 align:middle line:90%
than you get inside.

00:24:14.877 --> 00:24:19.648 align:middle line:84%
This is what -- and only this,
but it's a challenge also

00:24:19.648 --> 00:24:22.118 align:middle line:84%
to express this
gift in the world.

00:24:22.118 --> 00:24:25.688 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not enough to go as
nice as we can to the retreat,

00:24:25.688 --> 00:24:28.391 align:middle line:84%
have this beautiful
moment of life.

00:24:28.391 --> 00:24:30.288 align:middle line:84%
Then the most
important thing is I

00:24:30.288 --> 00:24:34.296 align:middle line:84%
want to see this gift
implemented in the world,

00:24:34.296 --> 00:24:36.232 align:middle line:84%
I want you to show
up in the world.

00:24:36.232 --> 00:24:39.886 align:middle line:84%
Because as you see one
of the biggest moments,

00:24:39.886 --> 00:24:43.505 align:middle line:84%
you know, to be
seen, to belong, is

00:24:43.505 --> 00:24:46.776 align:middle line:84%
one of the most
greatest human needs.

00:24:46.776 --> 00:24:50.297 align:middle line:84%
But they do come
at the forefront

00:24:50.297 --> 00:24:52.314 align:middle line:90%
when you're a teenager.

00:24:52.314 --> 00:24:58.020 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you know, they -- they
always belong to each other,

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.372 align:middle line:84%
they always dress the same,
they're all individuals,

00:25:00.372 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:90%
but they have --

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.798 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They have a great
need for acceptance among

00:25:03.798 --> 00:25:04.560 align:middle line:90%
themselves, yes.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.477 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: When I was 14 you
couldn't separate me.

00:25:06.477 --> 00:25:09.162 align:middle line:84%
I had this military
jacket, and I couldn't --

00:25:09.162 --> 00:25:10.941 align:middle line:90%
I was sleeping in it.

00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:13.108 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: My girlfriends and
I would call each other up

00:25:13.108 --> 00:25:15.171 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, what color
skirt are you wearing today,

00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:17.073 align:middle line:84%
are you going to wear your
little white skirts, yeah,

00:25:17.073 --> 00:25:18.441 align:middle line:90%
let's wear white today -- yeah.

00:25:18.441 --> 00:25:21.143 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Because -- by
the way, this is like --

00:25:21.143 --> 00:25:24.132 align:middle line:84%
adolescence and teens,
it's a modern invention,

00:25:24.132 --> 00:25:25.414 align:middle line:90%
this didn't exist.

00:25:25.414 --> 00:25:27.852 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What didn't exist?

00:25:27.852 --> 00:25:29.685 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Up to 200 years
ago, it didn't exist.

00:25:29.685 --> 00:25:31.687 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What didn't?

00:25:31.687 --> 00:25:32.655 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Adolescence.

00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:33.956 align:middle line:90%
Either you're a boy --

00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:35.157 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Adolescence --

00:25:35.157 --> 00:25:36.559 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Adolescence, yes,
I'm sorry, I apologize --

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:38.994 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'll just say it for
you, if your accent -- yeah --

00:25:38.994 --> 00:25:43.865 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: So adolescence didn't
exist because we created this

00:25:43.865 --> 00:25:47.443 align:middle line:84%
holding tank which is called
school, then you know,

00:25:47.443 --> 00:25:50.753 align:middle line:84%
they spend all these years
that they usually spend with

00:25:50.753 --> 00:25:55.330 align:middle line:84%
their fathers learning a trade
or going for some adventures

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.735 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in the world,
exploring -- anyway,

00:25:58.735 --> 00:26:02.866 align:middle line:84%
learning without a man, and it
was showing really the mettle

00:26:02.866 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
of who they were by
being with the men,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.783 align:middle line:84%
and they try and aspire to
be with men -- or women,

00:26:10.783 --> 00:26:15.535 align:middle line:84%
but they really try to be
recognized and seen and belong

00:26:15.535 --> 00:26:16.632 align:middle line:90%
to the group of men.

00:26:16.632 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And they took
responsibility at an earlier

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:20.669 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely.

00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:23.972 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
now is the holding tank

00:26:23.972 --> 00:26:28.215 align:middle line:84%
is the desire to be seen, to
show really the true colors

00:26:28.215 --> 00:26:33.415 align:middle line:84%
and to see them in themselves,
to be revealed to them.

00:26:33.415 --> 00:26:36.485 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't happen because
they're sitting in school.

00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:39.058 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's interesting, because
there is a school in Russia

00:26:39.058 --> 00:26:42.393 align:middle line:84%
right now that is -- it's
associated with the concepts

00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:45.261 align:middle line:84%
put forth in the Anastasia
Ringing Cedars series,

00:26:45.261 --> 00:26:49.265 align:middle line:84%
and I asked you off camera if
you were familiar with this --

00:26:49.265 --> 00:26:53.936 align:middle line:84%
yeah, and in this particular
school people are learning it

00:26:53.936 --> 00:26:55.271 align:middle line:90%
this way.

00:26:55.271 --> 00:26:57.740 align:middle line:84%
The children come because they
choose to, boys and girls.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And they are put into
very saturated curriculum

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.980 align:middle line:84%
based on their own desire,
propensities, needs,

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.850 align:middle line:84%
what they're curious about, and
they learn everything they can,

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.518 align:middle line:90%
all different ages together.

00:27:09.518 --> 00:27:11.453 align:middle line:84%
And they mentor and
teach each other.

00:27:11.453 --> 00:27:13.164 align:middle line:84%
It might be the
12 year old that's

00:27:13.164 --> 00:27:14.789 align:middle line:84%
really getting the
advanced mathematics

00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:17.059 align:middle line:84%
and they turn out
to be the leader

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:18.594 align:middle line:90%
of that particular group.

00:27:18.594 --> 00:27:21.263 align:middle line:84%
But they learn in
a saturated way,

00:27:21.263 --> 00:27:25.109 align:middle line:84%
things that are not only
educational but very useful

00:27:25.109 --> 00:27:27.036 align:middle line:90%
for their own lives.

00:27:27.036 --> 00:27:29.538 align:middle line:84%
They learn -- the boys
learn how to build things,

00:27:29.538 --> 00:27:32.441 align:middle line:84%
the girls can learn if they
want to build things as well,

00:27:32.441 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
and then they learn to make
the place beautiful by using

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.313 align:middle line:84%
artistic painting,
in particular,

00:27:37.313 --> 00:27:41.183 align:middle line:84%
to make the home domain they're
creating very beautiful.

00:27:41.183 --> 00:27:42.985 align:middle line:84%
And this brings up
the whole notion

00:27:42.985 --> 00:27:45.301 align:middle line:84%
of the educational
system we have

00:27:45.301 --> 00:27:47.122 align:middle line:84%
now, which I know
you unplugged from,

00:27:47.122 --> 00:27:50.644 align:middle line:84%
you said I'm not learning, this
is not teaching me what I need

00:27:50.644 --> 00:27:54.196 align:middle line:84%
to learn, and having it
integrate with what we chose

00:27:54.196 --> 00:27:55.898 align:middle line:90%
to become in our lives.

00:27:55.898 --> 00:27:58.400 align:middle line:84%
This is a radical reformation
that's needed in her.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.668 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely --

00:27:59.668 --> 00:28:01.904 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And as you say,
mentorship, apprenticeship --

00:28:01.904 --> 00:28:03.529 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: -- the more
I work with -- also,

00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:06.775 align:middle line:84%
using the hands by the
way, using hands to create.

00:28:06.775 --> 00:28:07.602 align:middle line:90%
Very important.

00:28:07.602 --> 00:28:09.144 align:middle line:84%
Been doing this for
a thousand years,

00:28:09.144 --> 00:28:13.200 align:middle line:84%
and now all of a sudden we
need to -- computer literate.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.617 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nothing
wrong, but what --

00:28:14.617 --> 00:28:19.255 align:middle line:84%
think of the loss of the craft
of the sensuality of work

00:28:19.255 --> 00:28:22.764 align:middle line:84%
and the connection you create
with your environment as you

00:28:22.764 --> 00:28:25.960 align:middle line:84%
take a piece of wood and you
start carving it or modifying

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.297 align:middle line:84%
it to create a
chair or something.

00:28:28.297 --> 00:28:34.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a -- it's something that
we're really wired, you know,

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:38.474 align:middle line:90%
the ability in order, right?

00:28:38.474 --> 00:28:44.680 align:middle line:84%
So they say it's really the
way to integrate a spiritual

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.950 align:middle line:84%
experience which is the
experience of prayer or --

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.818 align:middle line:90%
is labor, is using the --

00:28:49.818 --> 00:28:50.787 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Labor -- yes.

00:28:50.787 --> 00:28:52.454 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Using the
hands, using the hands.

00:28:52.454 --> 00:28:54.023 align:middle line:90%
We need to digest this.

00:28:54.023 --> 00:28:56.258 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is all, like,
a thousand years or so

00:28:56.258 --> 00:28:59.295 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual evolution is
like, where has it gone,

00:28:59.295 --> 00:29:01.563 align:middle line:90%
it's not there anymore.

00:29:01.563 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:84%
It's another loss because
we have, like, to go this,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.569 align:middle line:90%
and this, and you have to do --

00:29:06.569 --> 00:29:09.069 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk about the
kind of boys that find their way

00:29:09.069 --> 00:29:09.869 align:middle line:90%
to you.

00:29:09.869 --> 00:29:11.785 align:middle line:84%
And is it usually
the parents who

00:29:11.785 --> 00:29:14.231 align:middle line:84%
are looking for you
to help their sons,

00:29:14.231 --> 00:29:17.969 align:middle line:84%
or are the sons somehow coming
to you through some other group

00:29:17.969 --> 00:29:22.584 align:middle line:84%
or mechanism, and are they often
disconnected and, you know,

00:29:22.584 --> 00:29:24.969 align:middle line:84%
basically playing video
games and doing the standards

00:29:24.969 --> 00:29:25.888 align:middle line:90%
things kids do now?

00:29:25.888 --> 00:29:30.960 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Video games -- that's
how it started, this problem,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.760 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:37.933 align:middle line:84%
I did this massive
initiation, basically in 1997,

00:29:37.933 --> 00:29:41.970 align:middle line:84%
and it was this -- it
was a program after that,

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:47.109 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was very
valuable and I learned a lot,

00:29:47.109 --> 00:29:50.846 align:middle line:84%
it allowed me to be with other
men, and it was beautiful work.

00:29:50.846 --> 00:29:56.952 align:middle line:84%
And then because maybe
somebody got turned on to me,

00:29:56.952 --> 00:29:59.057 align:middle line:84%
I remember my father or
something -- obviously,

00:29:59.057 --> 00:30:02.991 align:middle line:84%
the sons of my friend were
sitting Saturdays home,

00:30:02.991 --> 00:30:07.396 align:middle line:84%
playing computers, because they
don't go anywhere, you know,

00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:10.232 align:middle line:84%
the [INAUDIBLE] and I said well,
next Saturday come with me,

00:30:10.232 --> 00:30:11.700 align:middle line:90%
I'll take you surfing.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.536 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we started.

00:30:14.536 --> 00:30:18.173 align:middle line:84%
Take the kids surfing,
which is challenging.

00:30:18.173 --> 00:30:20.175 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Were they resistant
to it or were they --

00:30:20.175 --> 00:30:24.123 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Well, I wasn't their
father, so it was cool,

00:30:24.123 --> 00:30:25.514 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:30:25.514 --> 00:30:31.036 align:middle line:84%
Surfing was the excuse for
them to show up on time,

00:30:31.036 --> 00:30:32.554 align:middle line:90%
ready to go.

00:30:32.554 --> 00:30:34.323 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And they
willingly did this?

00:30:34.323 --> 00:30:35.723 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Not willingly.

00:30:35.723 --> 00:30:37.994 align:middle line:84%
To do it willingly,
there are consequences.

00:30:37.994 --> 00:30:38.794 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:30:38.794 --> 00:30:39.795 align:middle line:90%
Okay.

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:41.563 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: They had to
pay consequences.

00:30:41.563 --> 00:30:47.602 align:middle line:84%
And so they get it, there's no
negotiation, it's 8 o'clock,

00:30:47.602 --> 00:30:49.071 align:middle line:90%
it's 8 o'clock.

00:30:49.071 --> 00:30:51.106 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not there,
there are consequences.

00:30:51.106 --> 00:30:56.011 align:middle line:84%
It's not punishment,
consequences, right?

00:30:56.011 --> 00:31:00.315 align:middle line:84%
So they'd be there 8
o'clock and they're ready,

00:31:00.315 --> 00:31:03.886 align:middle line:84%
so we can go have fun,
instead of take care of the --

00:31:03.886 --> 00:31:05.020 align:middle line:90%
>> RM:

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.423 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: And was there a
transformative moment for these

00:31:07.423 --> 00:31:08.223 align:middle line:90%
boys?

00:31:08.223 --> 00:31:11.726 align:middle line:84%
Did they end up saying hey, yes,
after the first time or so, did

00:31:11.726 --> 00:31:13.929 align:middle line:84%
they want to get up
and go or did they --

00:31:13.929 --> 00:31:16.425 align:middle line:84%
was it something you had
to really draw out of them?

00:31:16.425 --> 00:31:17.633 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: They'd never fell you.

00:31:17.633 --> 00:31:19.501 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: They're too cool.

00:31:19.501 --> 00:31:21.370 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: They're going
to learn to show up,

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.806 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
learn how to surf,

00:31:23.806 --> 00:31:27.109 align:middle line:84%
they're going to learn to
have fun with other boys,

00:31:27.109 --> 00:31:30.612 align:middle line:84%
without killing anybody,
and have true fun.

00:31:30.612 --> 00:31:33.103 align:middle line:84%
So this is how it start,
and I start taking it up

00:31:33.103 --> 00:31:35.684 align:middle line:84%
in the mountains, and
wow, this is working.

00:31:35.684 --> 00:31:38.562 align:middle line:84%
And then became -- then
I discovered there was

00:31:38.562 --> 00:31:43.625 align:middle line:84%
a gentleman, his name is Brad
Leslie, is my mentor in Canada,

00:31:43.625 --> 00:31:46.895 align:middle line:84%
this guy started this young
men's adventure weekend,

00:31:46.895 --> 00:31:50.266 align:middle line:84%
it's another one
coming up on the 12th.

00:31:50.266 --> 00:31:51.066 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: What?

00:31:51.066 --> 00:31:52.108 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Adventure weekend.

00:31:52.108 --> 00:31:53.101 align:middle line:90%
Coming up 12 of July.

00:31:53.101 --> 00:31:56.305 align:middle line:84%
And he brings, like,
hundreds of kids

00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:59.041 align:middle line:90%
at a time in the wilderness.

00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:01.369 align:middle line:84%
And there are hundreds
of men and hundreds

00:32:01.369 --> 00:32:05.414 align:middle line:84%
of kids, young men, and they
live together for a weekend.

00:32:05.414 --> 00:32:06.548 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing place.

00:32:06.548 --> 00:32:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I want to
talk about that.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.320 align:middle line:84%
What the process is like,
what they're like coming in,

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.688 align:middle line:90%
is there prep for that?

00:32:12.688 --> 00:32:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And I also wanted
to ask you when

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.962 align:middle line:84%
you connect with these boys and
they have a chance to really

00:32:17.962 --> 00:32:20.472 align:middle line:84%
come alive inside of themselves,
outside of the family

00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:22.492 align:middle line:84%
structure, outside of
the educational structure

00:32:22.492 --> 00:32:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, where they're
just there, as you say,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.736 align:middle line:84%
to work it out in these
weekends together.

00:32:27.736 --> 00:32:31.641 align:middle line:84%
Do you notice that they do --
already have an idea of what

00:32:31.641 --> 00:32:32.441 align:middle line:90%
their purpose is?

00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:33.476 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely.

00:32:33.476 --> 00:32:34.476 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Most of the time?

00:32:34.476 --> 00:32:35.677 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely.

00:32:35.677 --> 00:32:38.766 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because you talk to most
adult men right now and they

00:32:38.766 --> 00:32:42.184 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what they're
here for or want to do.

00:32:42.184 --> 00:32:44.086 align:middle line:90%
It's like it gets squashed out.

00:32:44.086 --> 00:32:45.815 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
if you preempt it,

00:32:45.815 --> 00:32:49.760 align:middle line:84%
if you catch it early and foster
it, they know this already?

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.260 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Yeah, this
is very important,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.596 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not a teacher,
I don't invent the wheel,

00:32:54.596 --> 00:32:56.598 align:middle line:90%
the wheel is already there.

00:32:56.598 --> 00:33:00.333 align:middle line:84%
My job is to find
a grammar so it can

00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:02.504 align:middle line:90%
be drawn out and recognized.

00:33:02.504 --> 00:33:04.406 align:middle line:90%
That is a skill.

00:33:04.406 --> 00:33:06.836 align:middle line:84%
And it's not something
you can learn in schools,

00:33:06.836 --> 00:33:08.511 align:middle line:84%
you know, you have
to be a little weird,

00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:09.511 align:middle line:90%
that's my qualification.

00:33:09.511 --> 00:33:10.928 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, a
little weird, yeah.

00:33:10.928 --> 00:33:14.650 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: A little weird, weird
enough so you understand --

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.320 align:middle line:84%
because they resonate with
your weirdness, really.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And because they're at a weird
time in their life, that's

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.559 align:middle line:84%
the time they're
officially weird,

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and I'm officially weird myself.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:84%
So there's a way we
can mirror each other.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.311 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned to
you the other time

00:33:30.311 --> 00:33:32.693 align:middle line:84%
we spoke when I
was a kid, when I

00:33:32.693 --> 00:33:35.704 align:middle line:84%
was a young boy, what happened
when I was in first grade.

00:33:35.704 --> 00:33:39.942 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, tell us about that
again, that was off camera.

00:33:39.942 --> 00:33:42.494 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: There was the teacher
took a liking to me in first

00:33:42.494 --> 00:33:47.066 align:middle line:84%
grade, and the other teacher --
the other mothers got jealous

00:33:47.066 --> 00:33:50.050 align:middle line:84%
and made it -- protested
with the head master,

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.315 align:middle line:84%
and the head master
walked in the class,

00:33:52.315 --> 00:33:57.169 align:middle line:84%
sat down in front of me, and
went to find out if I'm really

00:33:57.169 --> 00:33:59.795 align:middle line:84%
that smart genius my
teacher thought I was.

00:33:59.795 --> 00:34:06.169 align:middle line:84%
This was the last time any woman
thought I was a smart genius --

00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.969 align:middle line:90%
[laughter] but --

00:34:06.969 --> 00:34:08.302 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Jealous mothers, okay.

00:34:08.302 --> 00:34:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: So the teacher
ran me through some test,

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.578 align:middle line:90%
and I aced them.

00:34:16.578 --> 00:34:21.026 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember if
[INAUDIBLE] and the head master

00:34:21.026 --> 00:34:27.723 align:middle line:84%
was very pleased with himself,
he had this grin on his face.

00:34:27.723 --> 00:34:34.563 align:middle line:84%
And when I seen that, I was
filled with a cold fury.

00:34:34.563 --> 00:34:36.098 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Why?

00:34:36.098 --> 00:34:39.101 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Well, it took me
fifty years to find out.

00:34:39.101 --> 00:34:41.637 align:middle line:84%
But it was a cold
fury, and it said --

00:34:41.637 --> 00:34:46.408 align:middle line:84%
the voice spoke inside me, and
said how dare you think that

00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:53.014 align:middle line:84%
this, knowing 1 plus
1 equals 2 defines me.

00:34:53.014 --> 00:34:55.050 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't the
one thinking this,

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:57.586 align:middle line:84%
it was a bigger thing
thinking this thing.

00:34:57.586 --> 00:35:00.373 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, the
larger part of yourself

00:35:00.373 --> 00:35:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Really, the
physical sense,

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:06.328 align:middle line:84%
I remember now being
expanded inside.

00:35:06.328 --> 00:35:10.432 align:middle line:84%
So all our -- they call it
an education system is based

00:35:10.432 --> 00:35:11.400 align:middle line:90%
on this, right?

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:17.406 align:middle line:84%
What happened to this rest
of the beautiful thing that

00:35:17.406 --> 00:35:18.206 align:middle line:90%
happens?

00:35:18.206 --> 00:35:23.627 align:middle line:84%
You know, as my friend
and coach says, 1 plus 1

00:35:23.627 --> 00:35:25.514 align:middle line:90%
is equals amazing.

00:35:25.514 --> 00:35:27.382 align:middle line:90%
And 1 plus 1 equals 2.

00:35:27.382 --> 00:35:29.902 align:middle line:84%
They're both -- you have to
be able to have them both

00:35:29.902 --> 00:35:30.702 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:35:30.702 --> 00:35:33.689 align:middle line:84%
So I had this vision, and
literally took me fifty years

00:35:33.689 --> 00:35:36.623 align:middle line:84%
to find out, because
we're in a world where

00:35:36.623 --> 00:35:38.260 align:middle line:90%
privilege is 1 plus 1.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:41.752 align:middle line:84%
If your privilege
is another thing,

00:35:41.752 --> 00:35:44.666 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be weird.

00:35:44.666 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So it takes a long time to
really become comfortable with

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.724 align:middle line:84%
this -- this is the first vision
six years old is a tough vision

00:35:52.724 --> 00:35:53.842 align:middle line:90%
to carry.

00:35:53.842 --> 00:35:55.883 align:middle line:84%
Also, you're not going
to talk to your mom,

00:35:55.883 --> 00:35:57.925 align:middle line:84%
because your mom is going
to say come on, go play

00:35:57.925 --> 00:35:58.747 align:middle line:90%
with your sister.

00:35:58.747 --> 00:36:01.501 align:middle line:84%
And rightly so,
because your mama

00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:06.288 align:middle line:84%
has to deal with the heroic
purpose of putting food

00:36:06.288 --> 00:36:07.556 align:middle line:90%
on the table, you know?

00:36:07.556 --> 00:36:08.890 align:middle line:90%
And it's other functions.

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.946 align:middle line:84%
Where do you go
with this, I'm not

00:36:11.946 --> 00:36:15.864 align:middle line:84%
the only one with these
kinds of visions, right?

00:36:15.864 --> 00:36:17.568 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But still
at six years old,

00:36:17.568 --> 00:36:20.523 align:middle line:84%
it was kind of defining where
your boundaries were at a very

00:36:20.523 --> 00:36:22.170 align:middle line:84%
early age and what
you were going to --

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Correct, when
I'm 18, I'm in college,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.976 align:middle line:84%
I look at the professor teaching
and he's a very smart guy,

00:36:27.976 --> 00:36:30.579 align:middle line:84%
very intelligent, very
articulate, brilliant.

00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:32.314 align:middle line:84%
But there's a voice
that comes inside me

00:36:32.314 --> 00:36:34.382 align:middle line:84%
and says the guy
doesn't know anywhere,

00:36:34.382 --> 00:36:36.312 align:middle line:90%
you've got to go somewhere else.

00:36:36.312 --> 00:36:38.687 align:middle line:84%
So you drop out of college,
I went to India and so forth.

00:36:38.687 --> 00:36:39.688 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: You went to
India for years,

00:36:39.688 --> 00:36:41.089 align:middle line:84%
you went on the
great journey, yeah.

00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.890 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Right.

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:43.024 align:middle line:90%
I went to the great journey.

00:36:43.024 --> 00:36:44.760 align:middle line:84%
But it takes -- and this
is really what I bring

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.694 align:middle line:90%
to the plate.

00:36:45.694 --> 00:36:48.048 align:middle line:84%
I said let's look
for that thing.

00:36:48.048 --> 00:36:49.631 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
it's going to happen,

00:36:49.631 --> 00:36:51.199 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it's
going to come forth.

00:36:51.199 --> 00:36:53.532 align:middle line:84%
It might be doing a sweat
lodge -- might be while you --

00:36:53.532 --> 00:36:58.306 align:middle line:84%
might be while you climb
-- do something crazy,

00:36:58.306 --> 00:37:00.642 align:middle line:84%
maybe you create a poem,
maybe it will be --

00:37:00.642 --> 00:37:02.444 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where
it's going to happen.

00:37:02.444 --> 00:37:05.059 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to create
opportunities for this

00:37:05.059 --> 00:37:06.581 align:middle line:90%
to come up.

00:37:06.581 --> 00:37:09.484 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So when you do this,
obviously this is what you do,

00:37:09.484 --> 00:37:11.553 align:middle line:84%
you facilitate these
moments of awakening.

00:37:11.553 --> 00:37:12.954 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Correct.

00:37:12.954 --> 00:37:15.966 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And so you're seeing
by the age of 12, 13,

00:37:15.966 --> 00:37:20.246 align:middle line:84%
14 years old, they know,
they really know inside what

00:37:20.246 --> 00:37:23.100 align:middle line:84%
their purpose is or what they
want, what they want to do.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.267 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: They know there's
something bigger than that.

00:37:25.267 --> 00:37:27.869 align:middle line:84%
They don't know, they're
going against the current,

00:37:27.869 --> 00:37:31.239 align:middle line:84%
the current says it wants to
put you in these little boxes.

00:37:31.239 --> 00:37:33.635 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I understand,
there's a mental disconnect.

00:37:33.635 --> 00:37:35.677 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: And they don't know
that this is possible,

00:37:35.677 --> 00:37:39.753 align:middle line:84%
there's a territory of vision
that is impossible and is

00:37:39.753 --> 00:37:41.416 align:middle line:90%
actually around you.

00:37:41.416 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:90%
You swim in it all the time.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.223 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I use nature,
because nature is fantastic,

00:37:48.223 --> 00:37:52.761 align:middle line:84%
you can sit in front with
ceremonies in front of trees

00:37:52.761 --> 00:37:54.796 align:middle line:90%
and have incredibly revealing.

00:37:54.796 --> 00:37:55.969 align:middle line:90%
Because they get it.

00:37:55.969 --> 00:37:57.677 align:middle line:84%
I don't tell them
what's going to happen,

00:37:57.677 --> 00:37:59.914 align:middle line:84%
I don't, but they
get the message,

00:37:59.914 --> 00:38:01.369 align:middle line:90%
whatever needs to happen.

00:38:01.369 --> 00:38:03.786 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When you're working
with boys you don't talk a lot,

00:38:03.786 --> 00:38:06.641 align:middle line:84%
there's not a lot of
information shared verbally,

00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:09.911 align:middle line:84%
it's all experiential, which is
as you say at that age you have

00:38:09.911 --> 00:38:13.842 align:middle line:84%
to reach out and
touch whatever it is.

00:38:13.842 --> 00:38:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: As Brad said,
they learn by doing,

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.811 align:middle line:84%
they learn by being
treated by men,

00:38:17.811 --> 00:38:20.857 align:middle line:84%
we treat them like they're ten
years old and then they are.

00:38:20.857 --> 00:38:22.524 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So they have
full responsibility?

00:38:22.524 --> 00:38:23.859 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Full responsibility.

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:27.429 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: How does that -- what
does that weekend look like

00:38:27.429 --> 00:38:28.763 align:middle line:90%
or that time together?

00:38:28.763 --> 00:38:32.067 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Well, I've got to tell
you a little bit about it,

00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:34.410 align:middle line:84%
because it changes, depends
on the communities where you

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.210 align:middle line:90%
produce it.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: That makes sense, sure.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.752 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: If I go to Canada,
it's going to be one weekend.

00:38:38.752 --> 00:38:41.076 align:middle line:84%
If I go to California it's
going to be another weekend.

00:38:41.076 --> 00:38:42.511 align:middle line:84%
If I do it here it's going
to be another weekend.

00:38:42.511 --> 00:38:44.512 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
man with the brain,

00:38:44.512 --> 00:38:46.748 align:middle line:84%
because it's also
important to understand --

00:38:46.748 --> 00:38:47.916 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because they have
an imprint of their culture

00:38:47.916 --> 00:38:48.716 align:middle line:90%
on them, of course.

00:38:48.716 --> 00:38:49.754 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Absolutely.

00:38:49.754 --> 00:38:51.129 align:middle line:84%
And then for us,
the men that are

00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:53.503 align:middle line:84%
going to work with me, it's
not about looking good,

00:38:53.503 --> 00:38:57.526 align:middle line:84%
it's not about the degrees,
it's not about the grief.

00:38:57.526 --> 00:38:58.326 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Grief?

00:38:58.326 --> 00:38:59.794 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Correct.

00:38:59.794 --> 00:39:03.131 align:middle line:84%
Because a person's initiation
is a person going down.

00:39:03.131 --> 00:39:06.234 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of the process
the person is going down.

00:39:06.234 --> 00:39:11.239 align:middle line:84%
And really, a way, the best
way for a man to hold his truth

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:13.575 align:middle line:84%
and be honest is coming
up with his grief.

00:39:13.575 --> 00:39:16.164 align:middle line:84%
It's not about being
happy and successful.

00:39:16.164 --> 00:39:18.747 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's connecting with that
thing that breaks your heart.

00:39:18.747 --> 00:39:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Correct,
that's what you bring,

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.984 align:middle line:84%
that's going to make
you authentic and real.

00:39:22.984 --> 00:39:26.688 align:middle line:84%
Because boys, they
don't take bull.

00:39:26.688 --> 00:39:30.625 align:middle line:90%
They can smell you a mile away.

00:39:30.625 --> 00:39:33.962 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want people looking
good, I want people to be real.

00:39:33.962 --> 00:39:37.565 align:middle line:84%
If you're real, the
weekend is done, you know?

00:39:37.565 --> 00:39:38.767 align:middle line:90%
That is simple.

00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:41.937 align:middle line:84%
The people that work with
me and I work with them,

00:39:41.937 --> 00:39:46.542 align:middle line:84%
is that they require
me, absolutely, total --

00:39:46.542 --> 00:39:47.375 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Authenticity.

00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:49.044 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Authenticity.

00:39:49.044 --> 00:39:54.683 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking, it's
a process of separation.

00:39:54.683 --> 00:39:56.518 align:middle line:84%
The rite of passage
is separation.

00:39:56.518 --> 00:39:59.387 align:middle line:84%
They come from this world,
they go into another world.

00:39:59.387 --> 00:40:02.824 align:middle line:84%
We're not, we're
down the rabbit hole.

00:40:02.824 --> 00:40:04.392 align:middle line:84%
It's a person going
down to his hurt.

00:40:04.392 --> 00:40:07.529 align:middle line:84%
So they come for intellectual
perception of reality,

00:40:07.529 --> 00:40:11.166 align:middle line:84%
we go into intelligence
perception of reality.

00:40:11.166 --> 00:40:14.903 align:middle line:84%
And we achieve that by
an experiential thing.

00:40:14.903 --> 00:40:16.271 align:middle line:90%
So I make an example.

00:40:16.271 --> 00:40:18.840 align:middle line:84%
Come off the bus, been
two hours in this bus,

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.656 align:middle line:84%
and they're all rowdy and
full of spunk and things.

00:40:21.656 --> 00:40:23.281 align:middle line:84%
They're coming down
this trail, there's

00:40:23.281 --> 00:40:25.947 align:middle line:84%
a trail that goes down to
the lake, it's two miles.

00:40:25.947 --> 00:40:30.785 align:middle line:84%
It's two miles in the woods
and there's nobody there.

00:40:30.785 --> 00:40:33.021 align:middle line:84%
They're instructed to
go down in the woods.

00:40:33.021 --> 00:40:37.826 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
they hear is a man

00:40:37.826 --> 00:40:41.396 align:middle line:90%
who is doing this grief song.

00:40:41.396 --> 00:40:43.932 align:middle line:84%
And no one ever heard a
grief song, but something

00:40:43.932 --> 00:40:46.434 align:middle line:90%
that curdle your blood.

00:40:46.434 --> 00:40:49.124 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know what
it is, but you know,

00:40:49.124 --> 00:40:51.686 align:middle line:84%
so they're going down
this magic forest,

00:40:51.686 --> 00:40:56.411 align:middle line:84%
but now it becomes blessed
because of the singing.

00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:58.165 align:middle line:84%
So they come down
and it's -- oh,

00:40:58.165 --> 00:41:00.081 align:middle line:90%
we're not in Kansas any more.

00:41:00.081 --> 00:41:03.084 align:middle line:90%
They have to proceed, right?

00:41:03.084 --> 00:41:06.054 align:middle line:84%
So -- and then other
things happen on this walk,

00:41:06.054 --> 00:41:10.792 align:middle line:84%
they encounter homeless people,
they're laying in the middle

00:41:10.792 --> 00:41:14.096 align:middle line:84%
of the stream and tell them
don't go there, don't go back,

00:41:14.096 --> 00:41:14.896 align:middle line:90%
they're crazy.

00:41:14.896 --> 00:41:18.099 align:middle line:84%
And another guy in a suit
and passes by, this is like,

00:41:18.099 --> 00:41:20.935 align:middle line:84%
focus on things, go back
to things that are crazy.

00:41:20.935 --> 00:41:22.270 align:middle line:90%
So this is really strange.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.772 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it's
very disorienting?

00:41:23.772 --> 00:41:25.907 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Disorient -- that's
exactly what we want.

00:41:25.907 --> 00:41:28.209 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a gate.

00:41:28.209 --> 00:41:30.945 align:middle line:84%
So there are three men standing
in the middle of the road,

00:41:30.945 --> 00:41:33.515 align:middle line:84%
and these three men
are dressed in ashes.

00:41:33.515 --> 00:41:35.583 align:middle line:90%
And they're painted.

00:41:35.583 --> 00:41:41.356 align:middle line:84%
And so they come, they
come, so -- usually it's me.

00:41:41.356 --> 00:41:44.993 align:middle line:84%
So they line up in front,
they have to go past us.

00:41:44.993 --> 00:41:51.232 align:middle line:84%
So there's -- and ask them,
why are you here, individually.

00:41:51.232 --> 00:41:54.436 align:middle line:84%
Say why you are here, you
know, the answer is like oh,

00:41:54.436 --> 00:41:58.039 align:middle line:84%
because they try to figure
out what they want --

00:41:58.039 --> 00:42:01.318 align:middle line:84%
what I want to
hear, and I say, oh,

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:02.610 align:middle line:90%
because I want to become a man.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.714 align:middle line:90%
Go back, so they don't come.

00:42:05.714 --> 00:42:07.315 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean go back.

00:42:07.315 --> 00:42:09.339 align:middle line:90%
Go back.

00:42:09.339 --> 00:42:10.351 align:middle line:90%
Next.

00:42:10.351 --> 00:42:13.343 align:middle line:84%
So everybody goes this
turn until they tell

00:42:13.343 --> 00:42:14.756 align:middle line:90%
me something that's honest.

00:42:14.756 --> 00:42:18.226 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why
I'm here, go, pass.

00:42:18.226 --> 00:42:19.227 align:middle line:90%
You know, and --

00:42:19.227 --> 00:42:21.262 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: No canned
answers are acceptable.

00:42:21.262 --> 00:42:26.134 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: So the other
thing is what they bring.

00:42:26.134 --> 00:42:27.569 align:middle line:90%
Well, oh, what?

00:42:27.569 --> 00:42:28.503 align:middle line:90%
What did you bring?

00:42:28.503 --> 00:42:29.137 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:42:29.137 --> 00:42:29.737 align:middle line:90%
Go back.

00:42:29.737 --> 00:42:30.537 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:42:30.537 --> 00:42:35.176 align:middle line:90%
Lasts 20 minutes, 50 people.

00:42:35.176 --> 00:42:38.113 align:middle line:84%
But it's the most
profound moment.

00:42:38.113 --> 00:42:41.722 align:middle line:84%
I know that when they walk
through this gateway they are

00:42:41.722 --> 00:42:44.219 align:middle line:90%
-- they want to be here.

00:42:44.219 --> 00:42:47.456 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, and then you have
a variety of experiences beyond

00:42:47.456 --> 00:42:48.256 align:middle line:90%
the gateway.

00:42:48.256 --> 00:42:51.159 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
that you also --

00:42:51.159 --> 00:42:54.496 align:middle line:84%
you're very connected with the
animal kingdom and have a way

00:42:54.496 --> 00:42:57.198 align:middle line:84%
of intuitive connecting
with the animal kingdom.

00:42:57.198 --> 00:43:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And you have begun tracking,
taking people tracking so they

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:01.870 align:middle line:90%
start --

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.146 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: This is not the program,
this is something different we

00:43:04.146 --> 00:43:04.946 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:43:04.946 --> 00:43:07.509 align:middle line:84%
We do a little bit of a program
because there's no time.

00:43:07.509 --> 00:43:10.178 align:middle line:84%
Next thing they do
is elect the leaders.

00:43:10.178 --> 00:43:12.643 align:middle line:84%
That's another very
important moment,

00:43:12.643 --> 00:43:15.348 align:middle line:84%
because they circle
up and say we're

00:43:15.348 --> 00:43:18.086 align:middle line:84%
going to have to elect leaders,
and everybody's oh, me, me, me.

00:43:18.086 --> 00:43:19.990 align:middle line:90%
Okay, step in the circle.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.823 align:middle line:84%
What is there about you
that makes a leader?

00:43:21.823 --> 00:43:25.560 align:middle line:90%
And they go oh, umm, umm.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.196 align:middle line:84%
So they have to come up with
something which is honest.

00:43:28.196 --> 00:43:31.266 align:middle line:90%
So they're not in Kansas.

00:43:31.266 --> 00:43:34.402 align:middle line:84%
And everything, you know, is
like go forward, come back.

00:43:34.402 --> 00:43:37.572 align:middle line:84%
They're always people telling
totally disorienting thing,

00:43:37.572 --> 00:43:38.773 align:middle line:90%
do this, do that.

00:43:38.773 --> 00:43:40.376 align:middle line:84%
If not the right
answer they have

00:43:40.376 --> 00:43:44.146 align:middle line:84%
to come up with the own wisdom
in the thing, which is theirs,

00:43:44.146 --> 00:43:44.946 align:middle line:90%
later.

00:43:44.946 --> 00:43:47.382 align:middle line:90%
Nature is a big part.

00:43:47.382 --> 00:43:50.022 align:middle line:84%
Nature is a big
part of the event

00:43:50.022 --> 00:43:52.687 align:middle line:84%
because always happens
in nature because that's

00:43:52.687 --> 00:43:54.355 align:middle line:90%
the way it works.

00:43:54.355 --> 00:43:56.266 align:middle line:84%
But then I'll have
something else, which

00:43:56.266 --> 00:44:00.862 align:middle line:84%
is a walk about in Colorado,
which is about tracking elk

00:44:00.862 --> 00:44:07.969 align:middle line:84%
and then really enter in this
dimension of relationship

00:44:07.969 --> 00:44:09.719 align:middle line:84%
with animals and
what inspiration

00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:11.706 align:middle line:90%
you can get from the animals.

00:44:11.706 --> 00:44:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the
interconnectedness of all these

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.476 align:middle line:84%
living beings in
your own place --

00:44:15.476 --> 00:44:17.078 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Yeah, you're
not on the trail.

00:44:17.078 --> 00:44:19.614 align:middle line:84%
You walk, you walk the
trail the animal makes.

00:44:19.614 --> 00:44:23.585 align:middle line:84%
You walk when he walks, you're
still, still when he's still,

00:44:23.585 --> 00:44:27.669 align:middle line:84%
you understand, you know,
probably a mountain lion

00:44:27.669 --> 00:44:30.927 align:middle line:84%
has been following this track
too because he needs to eat.

00:44:30.927 --> 00:44:32.594 align:middle line:84%
So there's a mountain
lion, there's a --

00:44:32.594 --> 00:44:35.297 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: A mountain lion, right,
tracking the same animal along

00:44:35.297 --> 00:44:36.097 align:middle line:90%
side you.

00:44:36.097 --> 00:44:39.634 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: The squirrel, the
squirrel knows you're here,

00:44:39.634 --> 00:44:41.369 align:middle line:90%
it's going to make a noise.

00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:44.138 align:middle line:84%
How can you make
the squirrel not --

00:44:44.138 --> 00:44:47.391 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So it doesn't start
chattering and alerting the elk

00:44:47.391 --> 00:44:50.816 align:middle line:84%
-- that you're -- so it's a
wonderful way to start really

00:44:50.816 --> 00:44:54.082 align:middle line:84%
seeing yourself in
a much larger web.

00:44:54.082 --> 00:44:57.852 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: You'll be amazed how
they fall in, like they've been

00:44:57.852 --> 00:44:59.687 align:middle line:90%
doing this all their lives.

00:44:59.687 --> 00:45:00.606 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:45:00.606 --> 00:45:02.523 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We have to be
innately hungry for this.

00:45:02.523 --> 00:45:04.292 align:middle line:90%
We are part of nature, we've --

00:45:04.292 --> 00:45:07.195 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: They get it like
-- if they're kids.

00:45:07.195 --> 00:45:10.365 align:middle line:90%
You know, 12 to 17.

00:45:10.365 --> 00:45:11.899 align:middle line:90%
Adult, they're lost.

00:45:11.899 --> 00:45:14.369 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I understand , too much
thinking has been bred out,

00:45:14.369 --> 00:45:15.637 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:45:15.637 --> 00:45:20.642 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about, for a
moment, after these boys return

00:45:20.642 --> 00:45:22.243 align:middle line:84%
from this experience,
and let's talk

00:45:22.243 --> 00:45:25.213 align:middle line:84%
about the interconnectedness
with the girls.

00:45:25.213 --> 00:45:27.548 align:middle line:84%
Because now they're coming
back and dealing with girls.

00:45:27.548 --> 00:45:31.571 align:middle line:84%
And you told me off camera about
one example of a young boy who

00:45:31.571 --> 00:45:34.389 align:middle line:84%
was dating a girl,
he really liked her,

00:45:34.389 --> 00:45:36.557 align:middle line:84%
but her family said
no, we don't like him,

00:45:36.557 --> 00:45:38.726 align:middle line:90%
we don't want him around.

00:45:38.726 --> 00:45:41.396 align:middle line:84%
Tell that story, because it
kind of shows where we are,

00:45:41.396 --> 00:45:43.464 align:middle line:84%
compared to what you're
trying to instill.

00:45:43.464 --> 00:45:47.602 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: This young man -- we
had a discussion that said --

00:45:47.602 --> 00:45:52.577 align:middle line:84%
so the parents told you that --
they didn't tell him not to see

00:45:52.577 --> 00:45:56.177 align:middle line:84%
her, they just made it
incredibly difficult.

00:45:56.177 --> 00:46:00.883 align:middle line:84%
And the guy, the man just
give up, said talk to the girl

00:46:00.883 --> 00:46:03.885 align:middle line:84%
said look, this is
too much for me.

00:46:03.885 --> 00:46:07.455 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to have to
quit this relationship.

00:46:07.455 --> 00:46:10.591 align:middle line:90%
And I said, like, are you crazy?

00:46:10.591 --> 00:46:13.171 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't use the
expression are you crazy,

00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:16.431 align:middle line:84%
but really, I was real curious
to find out what it is.

00:46:16.431 --> 00:46:20.955 align:middle line:84%
And I told him to go
and I said did you ever

00:46:20.955 --> 00:46:22.470 align:middle line:90%
watch Romeo and Juliet?

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:27.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, because
Juliet, you know,

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:32.748 align:middle line:84%
Romeo risk his life in
order to be with Juliet.

00:46:32.748 --> 00:46:33.548 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:46:33.548 --> 00:46:37.685 align:middle line:84%
And I'm Italian, so I know
those houses, you can't get in.

00:46:37.685 --> 00:46:40.388 align:middle line:90%
It's really difficult.

00:46:40.388 --> 00:46:47.929 align:middle line:84%
So he really -- go to -- he puts
his life on the line in order

00:46:47.929 --> 00:46:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to be with this woman.

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And I think it would
be such a good example

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.668 align:middle line:90%
for this young man.

00:46:53.668 --> 00:46:58.045 align:middle line:84%
So you see what happened, he
puts his life for the girl

00:46:58.045 --> 00:46:59.674 align:middle line:90%
does this crazy thing.

00:46:59.674 --> 00:47:03.344 align:middle line:84%
And Juliet has no
choice but to say yes.

00:47:03.344 --> 00:47:05.847 align:middle line:84%
Say yes, you know, gives
herself to this man

00:47:05.847 --> 00:47:07.882 align:middle line:84%
who is risking her
life to be with her.

00:47:07.882 --> 00:47:09.851 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
a beautiful thing.

00:47:09.851 --> 00:47:13.761 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm really interested,
and really this young man

00:47:13.761 --> 00:47:18.726 align:middle line:84%
misses out is the second part
of this scene with Romeo.

00:47:18.726 --> 00:47:23.531 align:middle line:84%
Because Romeo, the first thing
that happens when he goes up,

00:47:23.531 --> 00:47:25.232 align:middle line:90%
meets the Capulets.

00:47:25.232 --> 00:47:27.502 align:middle line:90%
His enemies, mortal enemies.

00:47:27.502 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And he calls his
enemies brothers.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Say, you don't know why
I'm calling you brother,

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:35.176 align:middle line:90%
but you are in fact my brother.

00:47:35.176 --> 00:47:38.379 align:middle line:84%
So I won't raise
my hands on you.

00:47:38.379 --> 00:47:45.052 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is shifts the
centuries of conversation,

00:47:45.052 --> 00:47:48.456 align:middle line:84%
the town of Verona is
shifted immediately

00:47:48.456 --> 00:47:50.625 align:middle line:90%
by this one act of love.

00:47:50.625 --> 00:47:53.828 align:middle line:84%
It's shifted the whole
culture of the city.

00:47:53.828 --> 00:47:55.728 align:middle line:84%
There's, you know,
Capulets, Montagues.

00:47:55.728 --> 00:47:59.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't exist any more
because of this act of love.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:03.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I'm really
interested, I -- that --

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.974 align:middle line:84%
that -- the guy gets
the girl is irrelevant.

00:48:06.974 --> 00:48:10.967 align:middle line:84%
What I was really relevant for
me, of course, very relevant

00:48:10.967 --> 00:48:11.879 align:middle line:90%
for the young man.

00:48:11.879 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But what's really
important is the trying,

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and the risk and the
totality of the act

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.090 align:middle line:90%
really shifts the society.

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:24.459 align:middle line:90%
The whole society.

00:48:24.459 --> 00:48:27.662 align:middle line:84%
It's a -- that's another
example for initiation.

00:48:27.662 --> 00:48:31.632 align:middle line:90%
That's truly an initiation.

00:48:31.632 --> 00:48:36.237 align:middle line:84%
Romeo doesn't come out of there
-- before he's a Montague.

00:48:36.237 --> 00:48:40.124 align:middle line:84%
He comes out of the
night of love with Juliet

00:48:40.124 --> 00:48:41.642 align:middle line:90%
he's transformed.

00:48:41.642 --> 00:48:43.444 align:middle line:90%
Total and other person.

00:48:43.444 --> 00:48:46.396 align:middle line:84%
He puts a service and
puts his new person

00:48:46.396 --> 00:48:48.035 align:middle line:90%
to the service of this world.

00:48:48.035 --> 00:48:50.818 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I was --
that's why it's important

00:48:50.818 --> 00:48:54.256 align:middle line:84%
for the ladies, for the girls
just to very conservative with

00:48:54.256 --> 00:48:55.056 align:middle line:90%
their --

00:48:55.056 --> 00:48:56.457 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Let's talk about that.

00:48:56.457 --> 00:48:59.727 align:middle line:84%
Because about forty years ago
the sexual revolution occurred,

00:48:59.727 --> 00:49:03.364 align:middle line:84%
it created a totally different
dynamic between men and women,

00:49:03.364 --> 00:49:05.299 align:middle line:90%
certainly in the western world.

00:49:05.299 --> 00:49:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And in that, there
was no responsibility

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:12.373 align:middle line:84%
to become engaged in an intimate
relationship with each other,

00:49:12.373 --> 00:49:16.043 align:middle line:84%
there was no consequence, it was
songs and movies depicted this.

00:49:16.043 --> 00:49:20.582 align:middle line:84%
It's like, get used to it,
get used to a one night stand

00:49:20.582 --> 00:49:21.382 align:middle line:90%
scenario.

00:49:21.382 --> 00:49:23.818 align:middle line:90%
That became common in the '70's.

00:49:23.818 --> 00:49:28.934 align:middle line:84%
And women had to kind of --
there was almost an emotional

00:49:28.934 --> 00:49:32.828 align:middle line:84%
panic in the psyche to figure
out how do we do this whole

00:49:32.828 --> 00:49:33.628 align:middle line:90%
thing now.

00:49:33.628 --> 00:49:37.533 align:middle line:84%
It changed so abruptly from
where people fell in love

00:49:37.533 --> 00:49:39.033 align:middle line:84%
and made a commitment
to each other.

00:49:39.033 --> 00:49:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And now it's just this is what
I'm supposed to do, I suppose.

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:46.307 align:middle line:84%
So the women had to become
very self sufficient.

00:49:46.307 --> 00:49:48.169 align:middle line:84%
We're now seeing
this, and we're now

00:49:48.169 --> 00:49:50.375 align:middle line:84%
seeing these women often
divorced or not married

00:49:50.375 --> 00:49:54.649 align:middle line:84%
at all, their children and their
girls unhappy, and these girls,

00:49:54.649 --> 00:49:57.279 align:middle line:84%
their daughters are now
learning the same thing, which

00:49:57.279 --> 00:49:59.331 align:middle line:84%
is men won't be there
for you, you better

00:49:59.331 --> 00:50:02.223 align:middle line:84%
have it together and be able
to take care of yourself.

00:50:02.223 --> 00:50:06.494 align:middle line:84%
There's no more of this
interdependence, so to speak.

00:50:06.494 --> 00:50:10.331 align:middle line:84%
So what happened in your
eyes when women said --

00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:13.702 align:middle line:84%
bought into it and said okay, if
that's how we're supposed to do

00:50:13.702 --> 00:50:14.502 align:middle line:90%
it now.

00:50:14.502 --> 00:50:18.973 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: They really sold
this bill of goods.

00:50:18.973 --> 00:50:22.076 align:middle line:84%
Because again, there's a
process of that awakening.

00:50:22.076 --> 00:50:26.991 align:middle line:84%
And we think because we have
hormones, develop breasts,

00:50:26.991 --> 00:50:30.151 align:middle line:90%
that is about sexual.

00:50:30.151 --> 00:50:34.422 align:middle line:84%
Totally is a sexual
is part of it.

00:50:34.422 --> 00:50:36.290 align:middle line:84%
It's like intellect,
intelligence.

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.491 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:50:37.491 --> 00:50:40.127 align:middle line:84%
Sex is part of it, but
it's not the whole thing.

00:50:40.127 --> 00:50:41.711 align:middle line:84%
So I think as a
culture we don't have

00:50:41.711 --> 00:50:44.283 align:middle line:84%
room for the whole
thing, which is really

00:50:44.283 --> 00:50:46.534 align:middle line:90%
about awakening to love.

00:50:46.534 --> 00:50:49.089 align:middle line:90%
So that's what makes --

00:50:49.089 --> 00:50:52.538 align:middle line:84%
Juliet makes of Romeo,
makes him this hero

00:50:52.538 --> 00:50:54.642 align:middle line:90%
because she makes him a hero.

00:50:54.642 --> 00:50:58.814 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And he's earning her love
with his own valor and courage

00:50:58.814 --> 00:50:59.614 align:middle line:90%
and commitment.

00:50:59.614 --> 00:51:00.147 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Correct.

00:51:00.147 --> 00:51:00.948 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:00.948 --> 00:51:02.383 align:middle line:90%
But see, that's the dynamic.

00:51:02.383 --> 00:51:03.183 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:51:03.183 --> 00:51:06.032 align:middle line:84%
You can't just hang out with
a guy because he's liking,

00:51:06.032 --> 00:51:08.717 align:middle line:84%
all day, so you want to
sleep with my daughter,

00:51:08.717 --> 00:51:10.491 align:middle line:90%
go steal ten horses.

00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:12.126 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right, whatever it takes.

00:51:12.126 --> 00:51:13.294 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Whatever it takes.

00:51:13.294 --> 00:51:14.877 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Bring something
to the table --

00:51:14.877 --> 00:51:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Prove yourself.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.335 align:middle line:84%
It's not so much
about the horses,

00:51:17.335 --> 00:51:19.509 align:middle line:84%
but you going out and
going on an adventure

00:51:19.509 --> 00:51:24.405 align:middle line:84%
and getting support of your
cousins, and come up a man.

00:51:24.405 --> 00:51:29.677 align:middle line:84%
So this is a -- this is what we
say earlier, easy sex makes --

00:51:29.677 --> 00:51:30.578 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Easy sex, yes.

00:51:30.578 --> 00:51:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: -- makes a boy the boys.

00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Only such a --

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.015 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The men don't grow up.

00:51:34.015 --> 00:51:36.317 align:middle line:84%
The men don't grow up
the same way, then.

00:51:36.317 --> 00:51:37.652 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: No, they don't.

00:51:37.652 --> 00:51:42.206 align:middle line:84%
No, why do you want to grow
up if you can get easy sex?

00:51:42.206 --> 00:51:43.006 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:51:43.006 --> 00:51:45.926 align:middle line:90%
What forces you to manhood?

00:51:45.926 --> 00:51:49.897 align:middle line:84%
We do whatever -- if the lady
says climb the tree we're going

00:51:49.897 --> 00:51:51.098 align:middle line:90%
climb the tree.

00:51:51.098 --> 00:51:54.058 align:middle line:84%
If we're not to
have sex, we have

00:51:54.058 --> 00:51:58.205 align:middle line:84%
to be honorable, smart,
gallant, courageous.

00:51:58.205 --> 00:52:00.775 align:middle line:90%
That's what we will be.

00:52:00.775 --> 00:52:05.218 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And the thing is,
even amidst all of this over

00:52:05.218 --> 00:52:07.829 align:middle line:84%
the last forty
years women, I mean,

00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:11.952 align:middle line:84%
they're so happy to have nooks
and kindles now because still,

00:52:11.952 --> 00:52:14.922 align:middle line:84%
girls and women are reading
these incredible romance novels

00:52:14.922 --> 00:52:15.767 align:middle line:90%
that go that way.

00:52:15.767 --> 00:52:17.934 align:middle line:84%
They don't want anyone to
know they're reading them,

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:18.292 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:52:18.292 --> 00:52:20.488 align:middle line:84%
Then you have, you know,
various versions of it,

00:52:20.488 --> 00:52:26.167 align:middle line:84%
like 50 Shades of Gray, which
has a lot of sub text to it.

00:52:26.167 --> 00:52:29.631 align:middle line:84%
So this whole notion of a
polarization between the sexes

00:52:29.631 --> 00:52:32.473 align:middle line:84%
remains alive and well
deep in the psyche,

00:52:32.473 --> 00:52:34.842 align:middle line:84%
even on the outside I
don't - if you're a woman,

00:52:34.842 --> 00:52:38.512 align:middle line:84%
I don't need him, I don't need
any boy, you know, I'll come,

00:52:38.512 --> 00:52:40.881 align:middle line:84%
choose as I want because
I take care of myself now.

00:52:40.881 --> 00:52:43.984 align:middle line:90%
It's a split in the psyche.

00:52:43.984 --> 00:52:47.788 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Because it's really
the acknowledgement --

00:52:47.788 --> 00:52:51.726 align:middle line:84%
it's really the value in
the power of the feminine.

00:52:51.726 --> 00:52:53.694 align:middle line:90%
Total devaluation.

00:52:53.694 --> 00:52:57.164 align:middle line:84%
They sold this thing that you're
as good as you are pretty,

00:52:57.164 --> 00:52:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and put the skirts up.

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:02.843 align:middle line:84%
They're so, old fashioned in
the magazine selling this crap

00:53:02.843 --> 00:53:03.738 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:53:03.738 --> 00:53:07.241 align:middle line:84%
And it's really a
deeply devaluation

00:53:07.241 --> 00:53:08.909 align:middle line:90%
of the power of feminine.

00:53:08.909 --> 00:53:11.445 align:middle line:84%
Because they get in
touch with the sexuality.

00:53:11.445 --> 00:53:13.414 align:middle line:84%
It's got nothing to
do with feminine.

00:53:13.414 --> 00:53:15.549 align:middle line:84%
The power of feminine
is so much bigger.

00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:18.167 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is definitely
-- what I do for --

00:53:18.167 --> 00:53:23.737 align:middle line:84%
I don't -- I'm a man, I'm not
qualified to do rite of passage

00:53:23.737 --> 00:53:24.625 align:middle line:90%
for women.

00:53:24.625 --> 00:53:27.595 align:middle line:84%
But I do this thing
with the fables.

00:53:27.595 --> 00:53:30.498 align:middle line:84%
Correct, you're talking
about psyche before.

00:53:30.498 --> 00:53:35.236 align:middle line:84%
And the psychic model we
really learn when we grow up,

00:53:35.236 --> 00:53:38.239 align:middle line:84%
in the early ages, when
the stories are being told.

00:53:38.239 --> 00:53:44.111 align:middle line:84%
And I'm using the -- for
the girls, Snow White.

00:53:44.111 --> 00:53:45.446 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Snow White, yes.

00:53:45.446 --> 00:53:49.160 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Because Snow White
is such a perfect fable

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.451 align:middle line:90%
for nowadays.

00:53:50.451 --> 00:53:55.356 align:middle line:84%
Everything happens with the evil
step mother, or the evil mother

00:53:55.356 --> 00:53:58.211 align:middle line:84%
in the original version,
is really identified

00:53:58.211 --> 00:53:59.860 align:middle line:90%
with the way she looks.

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:00.995 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: She is --

00:54:00.995 --> 00:54:03.435 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: Identified with
the mirror on the wall,

00:54:03.435 --> 00:54:04.331 align:middle line:90%
fairest of them all.

00:54:04.331 --> 00:54:06.400 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That is
what's happening now.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.270 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: That is exactly
what is happening now.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:13.007 align:middle line:84%
Look what happens, because
her identification is

00:54:13.007 --> 00:54:19.446 align:middle line:84%
in the way she looks, she
creates these terrible deeds.

00:54:19.446 --> 00:54:20.848 align:middle line:90%
She kills --

00:54:20.848 --> 00:54:22.958 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: She kills the
innocence, she tries to kill

00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:23.384 align:middle line:90%
the innocence.

00:54:23.384 --> 00:54:24.634 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: She kills -- brilliant.

00:54:24.634 --> 00:54:26.086 align:middle line:90%
We should do this together.

00:54:26.086 --> 00:54:28.022 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: There you go, yes.

00:54:28.022 --> 00:54:29.190 align:middle line:90%
She kills the innocence.

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.526 align:middle line:84%
>> AV: She's killing the
youth, and the feminine.

00:54:32.526 --> 00:54:35.062 align:middle line:84%
By the way, this
fable is really --

00:54:35.062 --> 00:54:38.766 align:middle line:84%
points to the fact that all
the days, even our culture,

00:54:38.766 --> 00:54:42.399 align:middle line:84%
we are very aware that
this transformation,

00:54:42.399 --> 00:54:44.993 align:middle line:84%
this passage between
14, you know,

00:54:44.993 --> 00:54:46.941 align:middle line:90%
the age is very important.

00:54:46.941 --> 00:54:48.209 align:middle line:90%
Look what happens.

00:54:48.209 --> 00:54:54.847 align:middle line:84%
Snow White, they either
get closed into towers,

00:54:54.847 --> 00:54:56.930 align:middle line:84%
guarded by Dragons, they
go into these adventures.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:01.789 align:middle line:84%
If the passage doesn't happen,
the whole town falls asleep.

00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:04.592 align:middle line:84%
That's how much the power of
the feminine is not manifested.

00:55:04.592 --> 00:55:08.495 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
the whole town --

00:55:08.495 --> 00:55:11.332 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Falls asleep, waiting
for this to be awakened,

00:55:11.332 --> 00:55:13.634 align:middle line:84%
and waiting -- our
societies, we're out of time.

00:55:13.634 --> 00:55:16.136 align:middle line:90%
We could talk another few hours.

00:55:16.136 --> 00:55:17.471 align:middle line:90%
And it's true.

00:55:17.471 --> 00:55:20.007 align:middle line:84%
Our societies are waiting for
the feminine to come back.

00:55:20.007 --> 00:55:23.711 align:middle line:84%
Not to dominate, but to come
back and fully express itself.

00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:24.545 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:55:24.545 --> 00:55:25.795 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: And happening ritually.

00:55:25.795 --> 00:55:28.249 align:middle line:90%
It happens ritually.

00:55:28.249 --> 00:55:31.352 align:middle line:84%
And it can't -- it's not
a psychological problem,

00:55:31.352 --> 00:55:34.388 align:middle line:84%
it's a problem really to
awaken the power of gender.

00:55:34.388 --> 00:55:38.178 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing that
happens with the boys, awaken

00:55:38.178 --> 00:55:39.059 align:middle line:90%
the power of gender.

00:55:39.059 --> 00:55:41.495 align:middle line:90%
There's no psychology.

00:55:41.495 --> 00:55:42.730 align:middle line:90%
There's no --

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:46.021 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Old fashioned coming of
age and facilitating it rather

00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:47.268 align:middle line:90%
than squashing it.

00:55:47.268 --> 00:55:48.168 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:55:48.168 --> 00:55:49.737 align:middle line:90%
It's a wonderful conversation.

00:55:49.737 --> 00:55:52.240 align:middle line:84%
So I think this extended
out to a lot of hearts

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.407 align:middle line:90%
that are watching right now.

00:55:53.407 --> 00:55:54.207 align:middle line:90%
>> AV: Thank you.

00:55:54.207 --> 00:55:55.376 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Thank you, Andrea.

00:55:55.376 --> 00:55:57.945 align:middle line:84%
If your son is becoming
more socially disconnected

00:55:57.945 --> 00:56:00.879 align:middle line:84%
and fearful, perhaps some time
with Andrea and other kids

00:56:00.879 --> 00:56:02.950 align:middle line:90%
will bring him out of himself.

00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:05.185 align:middle line:84%
And we all have a part to
play in his development.

00:56:05.185 --> 00:56:07.221 align:middle line:84%
Hillary Clinton was
right about one thing,

00:56:07.221 --> 00:56:08.756 align:middle line:90%
it does take a village.

00:56:08.756 --> 00:56:12.493 align:middle line:84%
You can find Andrea through his
web site at livingthegift.org.

00:56:12.493 --> 00:56:18.565 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
