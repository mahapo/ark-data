00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: How many
times have we all thought

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:10%
of just quitting our lives,
of hitting the road and doing

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.004 align:middle line:10%
something totally unexpected?

00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:42.670 align:middle line:10%
Well, you're going
to meet a woman who's

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.020 align:middle line:10%
done just this, in a grand way.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:10%
Spirit told her it was time
to leave her life behind,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.010 align:middle line:10%
which included an arranged
marriage within her East Indian

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:10%
culture.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.700 align:middle line:84%
She was given no blueprint,
just to go on the road

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.100 align:middle line:84%
and tell the story of listening
to the universe as our guide.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
She called it the
Rebel Road Tour.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Simran Singh is here
to tell us her tale,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.330 align:middle line:84%
and hopefully embolden all
of us to have the courage

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
to do the same if we should
get the call from Spirit.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm so happy to
see you right now.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you, even though it'll
probably be passed by the time

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.210 align:middle line:84%
people see this, we are
sitting in a position

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.040 align:middle line:84%
where we've interviewed
people for years

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.050 align:middle line:84%
about this notion of the
grand cross to astrologically.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And everywhere, I
turn-- friends, family,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:84%
everyone-- is feeling
pressured, squeezed, challenged.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
One minute depressed,
the next minute elated;

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:90%
it's a wild ride.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what it
leaves most people feeling is

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.330 align:middle line:90%
they want to quit their lives.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:90%
They want to just quit.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And you already did it.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.030 align:middle line:90%
You got a jump on it.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.807 align:middle line:84%
So you can be our
guide in telling us.

00:01:44.807 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:84%
First of all, before we get into
your history and life-- which

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.860 align:middle line:84%
is really fascinating--
what does it feel

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.040 align:middle line:84%
like to have just up
and left it all behind?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.739 align:middle line:10%
>> SIMRAN SINGH: I think that
that's why this grand time,

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.780 align:middle line:10%
in this month of April
that is showing up that is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.350 align:middle line:10%
so challenging and so
difficult for so many people is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.760 align:middle line:10%
so timely.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:10%
Nothing is a coincidence.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.190 align:middle line:10%
And these challenges
that are showing up

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:10%
are to urge us into
what we really are,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.940 align:middle line:10%
which is creation, to
find our creative side.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.330 align:middle line:10%
That's the way through.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.790 align:middle line:10%
And that was what I found
myself in last year,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.800 align:middle line:10%
is when I embarked on
this road trip that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.670 align:middle line:10%
was truly an unknown for me.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.250 align:middle line:10%
It was asking of me things
that I had never done before.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:10%
It was asking me to be
who I'd never been before.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:10%
It was asking me to trust in a
way I'd never trusted before,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.940 align:middle line:10%
and to really allow my life
to be lived without a plan,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:10%
without control, without
trying to organize anything.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:10%
And I'd written and
talked about this

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.930 align:middle line:10%
for years with all of my work.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:10%
But could I really do it?

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.420 align:middle line:10%
And I had to do it.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.605 align:middle line:10%
Not for other
people, I had to know

00:02:44.605 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:10%
that everything that I
was teaching and speaking

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:10%
about in my magazine
and on my radio show

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.480 align:middle line:10%
was actually real and
not just another dogma

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.870 align:middle line:10%
that we had bought into.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: So how does it feel,
just on a feeling level alone?

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel
to have done it?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: It feels freeing.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:10%
It feels like heart opening.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:10%
It feels like diving into the
memory of the deepest, darkest

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.580 align:middle line:10%
pieces of myself,
and celebrating them.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.350 align:middle line:10%
It feels like I've bridged
something inside of myself,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:10%
a deep chasm that had
separated the dark

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.230 align:middle line:10%
and light, a deep chasm
that represented the fear

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.800 align:middle line:10%
and the love that had been
in a battle inside of me

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:10%
for years and years and years.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:10%
And a realization
that just struck me

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:10%
to the core, which was I wanted
to be just like everybody else.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.520 align:middle line:10%
I think we all want to
be like everybody else.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to be like no one.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be
special and unique

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.304 align:middle line:90%
and stand out in a crowd.

00:03:47.304 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And those were the
two parts of me

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.410 align:middle line:84%
that have fought with
me all of my life.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And we're going
to get into that backstory.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.505 align:middle line:84%
And you're doing this in an
RV, which we'll get into how

00:03:56.505 --> 00:03:57.630 align:middle line:90%
that all happened.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you first hit the road
and you left your life behind,

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
two little kids
in tow, what'd it

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.580 align:middle line:84%
feel like waking
up in the mornings?

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Were you more frightened, or
were you more freed and elated

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.755 align:middle line:84%
by the potential
surprise of the day?

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SINGH: For the
first time in my life,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any fear.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why,
other than I was

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:84%
so present to the excitement and
the imagination and the dream

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and the wonder of what
could happen next, what

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
is the magic that is going
to show itself today,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:90%
that it was like flying.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
It was freedom and excitement
and play and wonder.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.760 align:middle line:90%
And I was living an adventure.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I was living an adventure.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, OK.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Now we get into the story,
the backstory of your life.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your
parents, starting

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.440 align:middle line:90%
with your parents arriving.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:90%
Why South Carolina?

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: In India, it was
set up to where if you had

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
an Indian degree, you
had a second class job.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.830 align:middle line:84%
And my father wanted
to get a first class

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.280 align:middle line:84%
job to have a higher pay
to take care of his family.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.930 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, you had
to have a foreign degree.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.142 align:middle line:84%
And so he came to North
America to get his degree.

00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And while he was here, they
thought, we'll stay for a year,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and we'll show the
kids a different life.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go
back to our culture.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And when that
happened, circumstances

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.760 align:middle line:84%
created themselves
that they never left.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:10%
And this is where we grew up.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:10%
But we continued in the
same Indian culture--

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.380 align:middle line:10%
the traditions-- even though
we were in American society.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you were in
a very conservative American

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:90%
society.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was wondering, how
did he land in South Carolina?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean, versus North
Dakota, or California?

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:84%
How did they land
in South Carolina?

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: He was a
professor of biology,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
and there was a small African
American college in Denmark,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.440 align:middle line:84%
South Carolina where
he had a friend.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.847 align:middle line:84%
And the friend had a position
available for him to teach.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.596 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was wondering,
how you ended up there,

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
because this is going
to show up in the story

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.470 align:middle line:90%
prominently in a little bit.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.460 align:middle line:84%
So they came here with
virtually nothing,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.160 align:middle line:90%
and really rebuilt a life.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:84%
I heard you lecture
recently in Sedona,

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.670 align:middle line:84%
and you said they landed
here with something like,

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:90%
what, $8 in their pocket?

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.110 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: $8 in
their pocket, yes.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So they gave
up the life back home.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
They untethered from
all of it and came here.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But they did bring their
traditions with them.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.200 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: They did
bring their traditions.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
They came from a life--
particularly my mother--

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:84%
where she had never
even fed herself

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.857 align:middle line:90%
until she was 15 years old.

00:06:22.857 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:90%
She grew up with servants.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:25.314 align:middle line:84%
She grew up in a
six-story house.

00:06:25.314 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:10%
She grew up being the
type of child that said,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:10%
I want a pair of shoes,
and a cart full of shoes

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.003 align:middle line:10%
would show up.

00:06:30.003 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:10%
Or I want a new dress, and two
dozen dresses would show up.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:10%
And she came to
North America, where

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.700 align:middle line:10%
all of a sudden, pregnant with
me, she had to have five jobs.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
And so my experience in the
womb was already one of working,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.324 align:middle line:84%
already one of being
imprinted with the idea

00:06:46.324 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:90%
that you have to toil.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:90%
You have to struggle.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.567 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
work to create life.

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.320 align:middle line:84%
So let's move it
forward a little bit.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.070 align:middle line:84%
So you're in the world,
your sister's in the world.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember you saying
that there was only

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.570 align:middle line:84%
one really significant event
each year in your hometown.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was a beauty pageant.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.730 align:middle line:84%
And take some time to tell us
this story, because it really--

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:84%
I think it will resonate inside
a lot of people, how we're

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
imprinted so early
and so dramatically,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.610 align:middle line:90%
and so differently.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.197 align:middle line:84%
What happened to
you and your sister?

00:07:19.197 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, as I
went on the Rebel Road,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:84%
they were three memories
that really came strongly.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're speaking of
the memory that I had

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.280 align:middle line:90%
from being seven years old.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:84%
And in that town of one
stoplight of 3,500 people,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
there was just one event that
the entire town turned out for.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And that was the Little
Miss Beauty pageant.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.362 align:middle line:84%
And the teachers that
were at the school

00:07:39.362 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:84%
that my mother
taught at said, "You

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.870 align:middle line:84%
have to put your
daughters in this pageant.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:90%
It's what we all do here.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Everyone shows up, and
it's just a celebration."

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And so she came home,
and she told both of us

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.397 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to put
you in this pageant.

00:07:51.397 --> 00:07:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, as little girls,
who doesn't want to dress up?

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Who doesn't get elated
to be amongst all

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.250 align:middle line:90%
the other little girls?

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we got excited
about our dresses,

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.956 align:middle line:84%
and we got excited about
dressing up and going

00:08:00.956 --> 00:08:03.430 align:middle line:84%
into the rehearsals,
and did all of that.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the night of
the pageant arrived.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And we did everything as
planned for the first half

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.700 align:middle line:90%
of the pageant.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
And then as we were to
move into the intermission,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.280 align:middle line:84%
they decided to
change something.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And they asked all of the
little girls to go out on stage,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:90%
to line right up.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:10%
And I remember standing there,
and all of the little African

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.830 align:middle line:10%
American girls were to my left.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:10%
And all of the Caucasian
girls were to my right.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.722 align:middle line:10%
And my sister and I were
standing in the center.

00:08:29.722 --> 00:08:30.555 align:middle line:10%
And it looked like--

00:08:30.555 --> 00:08:31.470 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: They divided
it that way intentionally.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.875 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: They divided it
that way intentionally.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.084 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in my mind,
as I looked at it,

00:08:35.084 --> 00:08:37.620 align:middle line:84%
I thought, gosh, we look
like the crayon Crayola box.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:10%
This is just a rainbow of color.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:10%
And yet I didn't realize
why they had divided it.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.340 align:middle line:10%
In that moment, the
mistress of ceremonies

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.800 align:middle line:10%
said, would Nikki
and Simmy Randhawa

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.210 align:middle line:10%
please come to the
front of the stage?

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.520 align:middle line:10%
I couldn't imagine what we
were being honored with.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.550 align:middle line:10%
But out of all these girls,
the two of us were selected.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.190 align:middle line:10%
And a thought crossed
my mind that, why

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:10%
did they pick the
two brown girls?

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.052 align:middle line:10%
How come no one else?

00:09:00.052 --> 00:09:01.760 align:middle line:10%
And as I walked to
the front of the stage

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.960 align:middle line:10%
and I looked at this
entire auditorium that

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.520 align:middle line:10%
was packed-- all the
chairs had been filled,

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:07.920 align:middle line:10%
people were standing.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.260 align:middle line:10%
My mother and father were
sitting in the front row.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:10%
I felt so proud
that they got to see

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.100 align:middle line:10%
us standing right
up in front of them.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.580 align:middle line:10%
And then the mistress
of ceremonies said,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:10%
we'd like to thank you for
being in the Little Miss Beauty

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.830 align:middle line:10%
pageant.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:10%
However, we pick one black
queen and one white queen.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.090 align:middle line:10%
And you two are neither.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.010 align:middle line:10%
So we're going to have
to disqualify you.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.470 align:middle line:10%
In that moment, all I could
see was this audience.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:10%
And I saw people
leaning and whispering.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.310 align:middle line:10%
I saw people pointing
and laughing.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:10%
I saw people that, all of
a sudden, didn't feel safe.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.135 align:middle line:10%
And she said, go on
behind the curtain.

00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:10%
We're going to give you
coloring books and crayons.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.810 align:middle line:10%
And so they shoved
into our hands

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:10%
these coloring books
and crayons as if that

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.130 align:middle line:10%
was going to make it better.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:10%
And we were to go
behind the curtain.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:10%
What that did was I start
a tape playing in my head.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.392 align:middle line:10%
And that tape was--

00:09:58.392 --> 00:10:00.850 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: What did you do when
you got behind the curtain?

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.504 align:middle line:84%
What was going on
inside your body?

00:10:03.504 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:90%
Was it just shame, or panic?

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.210 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: I think I was in
shock; I think I was in fear.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:10.610 align:middle line:10%
I think that, as children,
we take the experience that

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:10%
happens, and we somehow
put it into our bodies.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And that's
impressionable age.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.880 align:middle line:10%
But a tape starts playing,
thoughts start happening.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.660 align:middle line:10%
And my thoughts were:
You don't fit here.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:10%
You're not beautiful.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:10%
The world is not safe.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.255 align:middle line:10%
People will not embrace you.

00:10:25.255 --> 00:10:26.920 align:middle line:10%
You can't be out front.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.350 align:middle line:10%
It's not a good place to be.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.160 align:middle line:10%
You need to hide.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:10%
And that was the moment
that I became a hermit, very

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.770 align:middle line:10%
shy and introspective, and
would lead to many choices that

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:10%
would become the
reincarnation of that moment

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.460 align:middle line:10%
to really compound those
beliefs into my cells.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:10%
The interesting thing,
though, is my sister

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.080 align:middle line:10%
was supposed to sing
at the intermission.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:10%
And so they called her
right back out on stage.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.166 align:middle line:10%
I talk about-- in my
first book, Conversations

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:54.540 align:middle line:10%
with the Universe,
how everything

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.260 align:middle line:10%
is a conversation to us.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.720 align:middle line:10%
But I don't think that the
people in that audience

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.000 align:middle line:10%
quite got it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Her song that she sang was
"This Land Is Your Land,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:90%
This Land Is Mine."

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.500 align:middle line:84%
That just made me
teary-eyed when

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.392 align:middle line:90%
I heard that part of the story.

00:11:06.392 --> 00:11:07.558 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Isn't that ironic?

00:11:07.558 --> 00:11:09.260 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like
this little girl,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
all dressed up in her puffy
little dress and cute little

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
hairdo who's just been
disqualified because of her

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
color, is singing "This
Land is Your Land?"

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: "This land is mine."

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
next-- I mean, you

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.920 align:middle line:84%
have to imagine, here's
a four-year-old singing

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.690 align:middle line:84%
beautifully, with a
little bob haircut.

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
she finishes,

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.110 align:middle line:84%
and the entire audience
starts clapping and cheering.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And people start standing.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And they just totally embraced
her, and celebrate the fact

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.470 align:middle line:90%
that she sang this song.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
the tape that

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:84%
started playing in her
hand was: I'm accepted.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm embraced.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.930 align:middle line:10%
People celebrate me.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:10%
They applaud me.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:10%
They want me in front of them.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:10%
Not only am I embraced,
crowds of people embrace me.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.690 align:middle line:10%
My sister today is the
governor of South Carolina,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:10%
running for her second term.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.025 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Isn't that--
I mean, that's just--

00:11:59.025 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.030 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: If that is not the
ultimate story of how the same

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:10%
event can affect two different
people in such drastically

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.790 align:middle line:10%
different ways.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.350 align:middle line:10%
>> SINGH: And send them down
two completely different paths,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:10%
even though they're
from the same family.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Now, your path stayed
a little on the closed and dark

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:10%
side.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And before we go into
that, after that,

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.470 align:middle line:84%
did she feel confident
then at school?

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.360 align:middle line:84%
Did everything she-- did
that reinforce her confidence

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
on all levels, so that she
could rise to the position

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:90%
she's in today?

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: She became
the extrovert.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.910 align:middle line:84%
She was the one that was
the popular girl at school.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:84%
She was the individual that
loved to act and dance and play

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
and put on all
kinds of creations.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.797 align:middle line:84%
It gave her a
sense of belonging.

00:12:46.797 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And she was accepted.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.370 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes, yes.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.982 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I mean,
obviously she's accepted.

00:12:51.982 --> 00:12:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: She is.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.140 align:middle line:84%
She's the youngest female
governor in the United States.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.046 align:middle line:84%
And she's applauded
all over the world,

00:12:58.046 --> 00:13:00.170 align:middle line:84%
because even in India,
they're celebrating the fact

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that there's a
female Indian that

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
has risen to that
type of status.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, I
went behind the curtain,

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.040 align:middle line:84%
which is so much
of the reason why

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:84%
the Rebel Road this
year was so important.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.450 align:middle line:90%
That was for me.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.340 align:middle line:84%
It was for me to see
me, and let me come out

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:90%
from behind the curtain.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you did
it in a very bold way,

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:90%
a very courageous way.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I want to move through
those other events.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Because of that
lack of self-esteem,

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:31.120 align:middle line:84%
you felt you would never be
worthy of having a boy or a man

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
interested in you when
it was your time in life.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.760 align:middle line:84%
And so let's talk about
the decision you made,

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:84%
the age you were
when you made it,

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and the feelings that
went behind that.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I talked about
in my show, and in my book,

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
Conversations with the Universe,
how 11 is a master number.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually a
significant age to all of us.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.490 align:middle line:84%
That is the age where
something has happened

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that really rocks
your world as a child.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:84%
It is the moment when you decide
to either stay on your soul

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.400 align:middle line:84%
path, or to divert off of it
and take the scenic route,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
and that scenic route
being the dark night.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.230 align:middle line:84%
And so when I came to
around that age 11 to 12,

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I had had enough
experiences that

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
confirmed that the
world was not safe,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
that confirmed
that it was better

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.670 align:middle line:84%
if I created a situation
where someone had to love me,

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.920 align:middle line:84%
had to be in my life, because
who was going to love me?

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.515 align:middle line:90%
I was ugly.

00:14:23.515 --> 00:14:24.515 align:middle line:10%
I had been disqualified.

00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:10%
The people didn't want
me in their world.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:10%
And so I went to my parents.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.420 align:middle line:10%
And I said, I'll have
an arranged marriage.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.660 align:middle line:10%
When that day
comes, pick the man.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:10%
Pick the date.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.720 align:middle line:10%
Tell me where to show up.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.090 align:middle line:10%
I'll marry him, because
I can love anyone.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.947 align:middle line:10%
I absolutely knew
that I had the power

00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:10%
to love absolutely anyone.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But you didn't feel
that you had enough in you

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.950 align:middle line:90%
to attract love on its own?

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
I can honestly say I
didn't love myself.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And it was many
years-- many, many,

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:84%
many years-- before
I would love myself.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.210 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have the self-esteem.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.680 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't look in the mirror.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see who I was,
because I was looking

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.860 align:middle line:84%
at myself through what I thought
the world's eyes were viewing

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:90%
me as.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So what did your
parents and sister say when you

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.262 align:middle line:84%
decided to do this,
when you told them,

00:15:08.262 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:84%
you announced that were going
to have an arranged marriage?

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Was it so much a part of their
culture that they didn't blink?

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Or did they actually
think you might go more

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:84%
into the American
way when you grew up?

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.060 align:middle line:90%
What was their response?

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, at that time, I
think my brother was about 17.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And what had just happened in
that moment was he was dating.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.210 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't know
that he was dating.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:90%
He was secretly dating.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And I had walked in on an
argument, a really horrible

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.070 align:middle line:84%
fight between them and him about
how he couldn't do this, that

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.440 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't the same culture,
it wasn't the same religion,

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.231 align:middle line:84%
that he couldn't be
hiding behind the back.

00:15:44.231 --> 00:15:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And he was the example
for his younger siblings.

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And he was not to be
someone that dated.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And what was interesting
about it is they found out

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.830 align:middle line:84%
because one of the teachers
had come to her and said,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to know
that your son is dating

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:84%
a young lady, and
she's Caucasian.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But she lives on the
other side of the tracks.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And if he's going to
continue to date her,

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.606 align:middle line:90%
I can't be your friend.

00:16:08.606 --> 00:16:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, jeez.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.834 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: And so
all of a sudden,

00:16:10.834 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
it became about all
the wrong reasons.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:90%
And I walked in on that.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
after praying to God

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:84%
to send me the handsome
prince on a horse

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.970 align:middle line:84%
that I deserve that could
make me see my own beauty,

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.750 align:middle line:84%
know my own power, revel
in my own presence,

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:84%
I knew in that
moment, I've just got

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.388 align:middle line:84%
to tell them that this
is what I'm going to do.

00:16:29.388 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:90%
Because dating has this outcome.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.410 align:middle line:84%
It's going to create
fight and turmoil.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'm already not
accepted in the world,

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.170 align:middle line:84%
so maybe I can be everything
that my parents want me to be

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.910 align:middle line:90%
so at least I have their love.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So it was always
seeking love, because I

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.960 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like
there was enough love

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:47.170 align:middle line:90%
around in the world.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you ended up
in an arranged marriage.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about what
happened in this way for you.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:84%
Because now you're
living a solid tradition

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
from your lineage, but you're in
a completely different culture

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.829 align:middle line:84%
with so many other influences
and messages coming

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
in, and then your own
internal dialogue and tapes.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.489 align:middle line:90%
How did that play out?

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:13.780 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, I think what
the core message is here--

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.120 align:middle line:84%
because whether or not you've
been in my culture or had

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
an arranged marriage, a lot
of people have done what

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:90%
I've done.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And that was try to
please other people,

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and try to be what other people
needed just to gain love.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.579 align:middle line:84%
And that, it's at the
core of what I did.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:30.046 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got
into this situation

00:17:30.046 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
where they said, "We
have the man that you're

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.750 align:middle line:84%
going to marry,"
what I didn't realize

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.780 align:middle line:84%
is he was getting into
this marriage for almost

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:90%
the same reasons that I did.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.500 align:middle line:84%
You see, his father
came to him and said,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
"You have to be the example
for your younger brothers.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.940 align:middle line:84%
For them to follow in tradition,
they have to see you do it."

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, at that time, he
was dating someone else.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:90%
He was loving someone else.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.160 align:middle line:84%
But he was forced to let go of
that person and to marry me.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And what I didn't
realize is he was not

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:90%
even attracted to Indian women.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.950 align:middle line:84%
So I created the
perfect scenario

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:84%
to really embed those belief
systems of rejection and not

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.920 align:middle line:84%
being loved, and
not being worthy.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.350 align:middle line:90%
And that continued on.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And when two people, or
anybody, gives up themselves

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.600 align:middle line:84%
to that to degree, betrays
themselves, abandon themselves,

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.670 align:middle line:84%
all they can do is
create a life that

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.310 align:middle line:84%
is going to show continual
betrayal and abandonment

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.990 align:middle line:90%
and abuse.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
basically what we each

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.840 align:middle line:84%
did to ourselves by
engaging in this situation.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is then the path
that we both ended up

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.650 align:middle line:84%
walking, a path where there
was a relationship that

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
was incredibly
dysfunctional, where

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.520 align:middle line:84%
there was tremendous
betrayal, abuse, abandonment.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And it was all to really show me
the ugliness that I felt I was.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.929 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.929 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How long
were you married?

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.261 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: 18 years.

00:18:55.261 --> 00:18:58.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:01.059 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it was a while
before you had children?

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:03.350 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: It was eight years
before I had my first son.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
what you did in those years

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:90%
of your life.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you're an
ambitious woman.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
You're a very, very
brilliant woman.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You have creativity,
what were you

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
able to express of yourself
within that environment that

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:90%
was quite toxic?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.850 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, what did
happen is I began to work more

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
As the betrayal and the abuse
continued in the marriage,

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.750 align:middle line:84%
the easiest way to deal
with it was to work.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I became a workaholic,
and I numbed myself out.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.050 align:middle line:84%
For the first 12
years of my marriage,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.450 align:middle line:90%
I never looked in the mirror.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.130 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want to see what I
thought everyone else saw.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it was much
easier to keep my nose

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
to the ground and my
head buried in work

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
than to actually face
life, or face other people.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was easy to
become a hermit.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's basically
how I continued

00:19:55.410 --> 00:20:01.120 align:middle line:84%
until that became such a mask
that I could no longer see

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.070 align:middle line:90%
or feel or do anything but hurt.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I came to the point where it
hurt so badly, where life just

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.810 align:middle line:84%
seemed so random
and so unfair, and I

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:90%
didn't want to be here anymore.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:90%
I just did not want to live.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't
understand how there

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.970 align:middle line:84%
could be a god, how there
could be a creator that created

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.790 align:middle line:84%
a place like this, where
there's just suffering,

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.770 align:middle line:84%
especially when I
was a good person.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.890 align:middle line:90%
You see, I tithed.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:90%
I prayed.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.410 align:middle line:90%
I was devoted.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
I did what everyone wanted.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
I made sure everyone
was happy and always did

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:90%
what made them happy.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And yet, they still weren't.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And neither was
I. And all of that

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.530 align:middle line:84%
is the beautiful
part of the story.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
In the moment it
doesn't feel so good,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.860 align:middle line:84%
but down the road
is the discovery

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:84%
that it was the most
essential piece necessary.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You had
to get to that.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
You really had to hit
bottom, so to speak,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.657 align:middle line:84%
where you didn't
want to live anymore.

00:20:54.657 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you had how
many children all told?

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.360 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: I've had two children.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, have had two
miscarriages as well.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of those
even had meaning,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:84%
because the children
that came in

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
came in at exactly
the right times.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
And they came in to show
me things about myself,

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and also to show us where
our very wounds were.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.190 align:middle line:84%
They were born at times to
take us back to the ages

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
that we were supposed to look
at in our own lives to heal.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.240 align:middle line:90%
But we were unconscious.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.620 align:middle line:90%
We didn't know that at the time.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that now, but we
didn't know that at the time.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we continued forward
in this false marriage

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
that was trying to usher
us each out into our truth

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
and our greatness.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.730 align:middle line:84%
But we were not courageous
enough to leave.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:41.387 align:middle line:84%
Neither one of us
had the strength.

00:21:41.387 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But isn't that how
it is when you've talked to most

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:44.930 align:middle line:90%
people?

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.600 align:middle line:84%
That kind of change takes
so much courage in life,

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.030 align:middle line:84%
because the foundation
of your world

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.600 align:middle line:84%
is irrevocably changed,
for better or for worse.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And most people really, it's--
life feels like a threat

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:90%
to many people.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that the
situation you're talking about

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.700 align:middle line:84%
might be how maybe even
the majority of people

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:90%
on this planet live.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.640 align:middle line:90%
They can't see a way out.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: And how many of
them are feeling right now?

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.240 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: But what that is,
a lot of people think that

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.890 align:middle line:84%
the opposite of fear
is actually courage.

00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Or they say it's love, but they
think the action piece of it

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.910 align:middle line:90%
is courage.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, the opposite
of courage is conformity.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.590 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we had done.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.310 align:middle line:90%
We had conformed to the culture.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But yet, we've also conformed
to the American society,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:35.520 align:middle line:84%
because we were in that
rat race of accumulation.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.050 align:middle line:84%
My husband was
incredibly successful.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.404 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a massive
home, far too large

00:22:40.404 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:90%
for anyone to live in.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.500 align:middle line:84%
It was 14,000 square
feet for three people.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Who needs that kind of space?

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But what we were trying to
do was accumulate something

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:84%
big enough to fill the
emptiness that was inside.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's what all
the material is.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to fill up what's
missing, when it's actually

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.737 align:middle line:84%
ourselves that we need to fill
up with to find that fullness.

00:23:03.737 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.050 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about what happened

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.465 align:middle line:84%
when you got the
hook up and the word

00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:12.120 align:middle line:84%
that it was time
to end all of this,

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:84%
and what the financial
part of that was like, too.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the
scary part for people.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.020 align:middle line:84%
It's, oh my God, if I
leave this situation,

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:90%
I won't have any money.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.570 align:middle line:90%
What will I-- where will I go?

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:23.410 align:middle line:90%
What will I do?

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And all that kind
of thing, I mean,

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.040 align:middle line:84%
that plagues people when they
think of big changes in life,

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.610 align:middle line:84%
whether it's leaving a marriage,
a family, a job, or whatnot.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, for years, I
had started following signs

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:84%
and symbols, because
when 11, and 11,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.190 align:middle line:84%
and 11 came in and opened my
eyes to the many different ways

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.750 align:middle line:90%
the universe speaks to me.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.731 align:middle line:84%
And so I had gained
a sense of trust

00:23:44.731 --> 00:23:46.480 align:middle line:84%
through realizing that
the universe really

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.880 align:middle line:90%
does have my back.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.705 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that
was an integral part,

00:23:49.705 --> 00:23:51.830 align:middle line:84%
to get to the point where
I'd recognize these signs

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.430 align:middle line:84%
and symbols, and know that
I could trust the universe.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:84%
But I found myself in
the very same place

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.230 align:middle line:84%
when I asked for the divorce
of, can I really trust?

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I was leaving
everything behind.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.510 align:middle line:84%
There was so much pain in
that relationship and so

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.140 align:middle line:84%
many memories that I
needed a fresh start.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.420 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "I'm walking away.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I want nothing from you.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:14.302 align:middle line:84%
I just need to know that
I can be here for myself,

00:24:14.302 --> 00:24:16.010 align:middle line:84%
and that I can be
independent, and that I

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.610 align:middle line:84%
have a power and a
presence within me

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.470 align:middle line:84%
to really live life the
way it was intended."

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's how our relationships
actually give us what we need.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.059 align:middle line:84%
When I prayed under
that tree to source,

00:24:28.059 --> 00:24:29.850 align:middle line:84%
that bring me that
prince that will show me

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
my beauty, my power,
and my presence,

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea that I needed
to have the opposite of that

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:84%
to discover that beauty,
power, and presence.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So this man was that
angel in disguise

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:90%
to bring me to that place.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.610 align:middle line:84%
And as I sat there in the
quiet-- feeling much more whole

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
than I had ever been, but
at a place where I wanted

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that life
really does work this way--

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I got the guidance to get into
the RV with my two children

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and to go out on the
road and put on 66 shows,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and that the RV would show
up, and the invitations

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.840 align:middle line:90%
to these places would show up.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And even furthermore,
that I was to sing,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.420 align:middle line:84%
and I was to do comedy, and
that I was to stand on stage

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.150 align:middle line:90%
and tell stories.

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And that I was
supposed to just wait,

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.420 align:middle line:90%
and the money would appear.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.003 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which is interesting
for someone who has hidden her

00:25:16.003 --> 00:25:19.790 align:middle line:84%
whole life, who's never put
her time into singing and doing

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:24.034 align:middle line:84%
comedy, no less telling your
truth to multitudes of people.

00:25:24.034 --> 00:25:25.325 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: I'm a serious person.

00:25:25.325 --> 00:25:26.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a funny
bone in my body.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So who am I going
to be as a comedian?

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.940 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: But you listened.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: But I listened.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:30.733 align:middle line:90%
I listened because--

00:25:30.733 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk about how
the RV came about, all of this.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, you made your commitment.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.490 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
through a divorce, right?

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.653 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:25:37.653 --> 00:25:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And you take your
two little kids,

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
say I don't want
anything from you.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
You walk from the house, the
14,000 square foot house,

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.900 align:middle line:90%
and all the other amenities.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, how did this
whole thing come about,

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the Rebel
Road tour and the RV?

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: So I had just
released my first book,

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.940 align:middle line:84%
Conversations with the Universe,
and I was giving a talk.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And as I gave that talk, a
gentleman came up afterward.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was really inspired
by the whole RV trip

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.390 align:middle line:84%
that I was talking
about as well.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.015 align:middle line:84%
And this was just
three weeks before we

00:26:05.015 --> 00:26:06.360 align:middle line:90%
were supposed to leave.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And he went home and
he told his stepfather

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.750 align:middle line:84%
about me, and about
the videos I was doing,

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.240 align:middle line:90%
and what I was embarking on.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And they sent me
an email, and said,

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:84%
"We are so inspired
by what you're doing.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
We have a 1991 RV
that's been refurbished.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:90%
It's 31 feet.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.050 align:middle line:90%
It sleeps six.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Are you interested
in having it?"

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.170 align:middle line:90%
And so the RV showed up.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later, 42
cities invited me to come.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Three months later, songs were
showing up in my email box

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
the people were writing
based on my emails,

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:90%
and based on my videos.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So things really were appearing
as I let go of everything, as I

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.694 align:middle line:84%
really trusted in the
unknown and decided

00:26:43.694 --> 00:26:44.860 align:middle line:90%
that I wasn't going to plan.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't going to control.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I was not going to
orchestrate life

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.170 align:middle line:90%
in any way, shape, or form.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
is so courageous.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:54.865 align:middle line:84%
And I love the story about,
as soon as you took off

00:26:54.865 --> 00:26:57.750 align:middle line:84%
in your RV, not
surprisingly, it broke down.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:00.272 align:middle line:84%
I love the story about
the mechanic's shop

00:27:00.272 --> 00:27:01.980 align:middle line:84%
you turned up in and
what happened there.

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Share that with us.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.570 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Well, the biggest
excuse that most people have is

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.020 align:middle line:90%
the money, like you said before.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
That is the thing
that stops everyone.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had already known
we were starting this

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.280 align:middle line:84%
with basically nothing--
two women, two kids,

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.230 align:middle line:90%
and myself in this RV.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And as we left Charleston, two
hours in we needed to get gas.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when we stopped and
I had to recrank the RV,

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.000 align:middle line:90%
it didn't crank.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.715 align:middle line:84%
And so we got jump started,
and we went to the campground

00:27:26.715 --> 00:27:28.140 align:middle line:90%
we were spending the night at.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.140 align:middle line:84%
And the next morning,
got up to leave,

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.150 align:middle line:84%
and again, the RV
wouldn't crank.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And so we had to be
jump started and carried

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:90%
to a service station.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.390 align:middle line:84%
As I was sitting there
waiting for them to figure out

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
the problem, they asked me
what the Rebel Road was.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the word "rebel" really
does trigger a lot of people.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.620 align:middle line:84%
But what I'm talking about
is the creative rebel,

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.490 align:middle line:84%
the one that has decided to move
beyond all the excuses of life.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And those excuses would
be: I don't have the money.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:54.660 align:middle line:90%
I have debt.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm not smart enough, pretty
enough, or good enough.

00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.860 align:middle line:90%
I've not been trained.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.030 align:middle line:90%
What would my family think?

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.196 align:middle line:90%
What would my friends think?

00:28:02.196 --> 00:28:04.200 align:middle line:84%
All of those excuses
that we use to not

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.210 align:middle line:90%
step fully into our dreams.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we step
into that dream--

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you were
telling the mechanics this?

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.763 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I was
telling the mechanics.

00:28:10.763 --> 00:28:13.410 align:middle line:84%
They were five burly men
with grizzly beards and oil

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:14.800 align:middle line:90%
under their fingernails.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.747 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
listening intently.

00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking
to them about living

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:90%
your passion and your dream.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we actually bubble up

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the inspiration that will
be the solution to all

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.310 align:middle line:90%
of life's problems.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And so by the end of
that, they were just

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.270 align:middle line:84%
kind of cocking their
heads to the side.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.686 align:middle line:84%
And the mechanic
came up and said,

00:28:31.686 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:90%
"I've figured out the problem.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a piece called a solenoid.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
And the solenoid is
a communication box

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.542 align:middle line:84%
that rests between the
ignition and the engine.

00:28:39.542 --> 00:28:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And it tells the engine that
you've inserted the key,

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's ignited and
it's time to move.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.140 align:middle line:90%
And so we've replaced that."

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And he handed me $200
and a business card.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:51.890 align:middle line:84%
He said, "The people
you were speaking to,

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:54.540 align:middle line:90%
that owner was really inspired.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.350 align:middle line:84%
We're in Fayetteville,
North Carolina.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the number one murder
capital of the United States.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And he's inspired by your
message of oneness and peace

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.970 align:middle line:90%
and inspiration.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So he wants to
give you this gift,

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:84%
and waive the fee,"
which was going

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:90%
to be a $600 or $700 bill.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And gave
you money to boot?

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.826 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: And gave me money.

00:29:10.826 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So it right there proved the
point; the money showed up.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And then I looked
down at the card,

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and these were pretty
heavy, burly men, not

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
the type that you
would imagine would

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.150 align:middle line:84%
have a pair of angel wings on
a transmission shop business

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:25.980 align:middle line:90%
card.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the name on the card
was Jim Souls, S-O-U-L-S.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.967 align:middle line:84%
So again, conversations
with the universe, the dots.

00:29:31.967 --> 00:29:33.716 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You never
know-- that's right--

00:29:33.716 --> 00:29:34.550 align:middle line:90%
where angels are.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:35.400 align:middle line:90%
They're all around.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.170 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.650 align:middle line:90%
And the universe is guiding.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.080 align:middle line:90%
That's such a beautiful story.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.580 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.038 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: But we
continued forward.

00:29:43.038 --> 00:29:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And we went to DC, where
the first show was.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the campground
and went in the office

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:49.810 align:middle line:90%
and came back out.

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, the RV didn't crank.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to get
jump started again.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.202 align:middle line:84%
Got into my parking space and
said, all right, universe.

00:29:57.202 --> 00:29:58.410 align:middle line:90%
You speak to me all the time.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:01.460 align:middle line:84%
You're trying to tell me what
the message in one of the shows

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.200 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be, or that
I'm supposed to carry forward.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to do
with the vehicle?

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.970 align:middle line:90%
If so, tell me the message.

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, I
heard the word "solenoid."

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
repeating that word--

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.400 align:middle line:84%
solenoid, solenoid, solenoid--
and all of a sudden,

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.990 align:middle line:84%
it turned into silly noise,
silly noise, silly noise.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.440 align:middle line:90%
And I got it.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The universe was
trying to tell me

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that it's all the
silly noise that we

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.660 align:middle line:84%
hear outside as the
chatter from other people,

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.360 align:middle line:84%
and the silly noise that we make
up inside of our own minds that

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:84%
keeps us stopping and starting
and stopping and starting,

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.360 align:middle line:84%
creating a block in
the communication

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.690 align:middle line:90%
from us igniting to us moving.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.390 align:middle line:84%
That it's the silly
noise that keeps us

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.100 align:middle line:84%
from following our
passions that rest

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.540 align:middle line:84%
in our hearts and our guts,
and following those dreams,

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and buying into the
dogma and the paradigms

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.570 align:middle line:84%
and the conversations
that society says

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.399 align:middle line:90%
is what we are to conform to.

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And so that became one of the
messages that created the show.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, so you
heard the message.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:90%
What happened then?

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.230 align:middle line:90%
Were you able to start the--

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.090 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: I sat in
the driver's seat.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I said, if this is the
message for the show,

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.010 align:middle line:90%
then let this RV crank.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And I inserted the key, and
the RV cranked ever since.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love it.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: It's great.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.761 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: OK, now let's
start talking about some

00:31:10.761 --> 00:31:13.100 align:middle line:84%
of the components of what
you are sharing with people.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Because this whole notion of
listening to the universe,

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.360 align:middle line:84%
many people feel they're
not capable of it.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.620 align:middle line:84%
They think you have to have
some special "gift," as it were,

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to listen to the universe
and the messages from it,

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.410 align:middle line:84%
or to listen to your
angels, guides, or whatnot.

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.510 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying, if you
listen, it's all around you,

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.700 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.050 align:middle line:84%
It's knowing what to look
for, what to listen to.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the process itself,

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.610 align:middle line:84%
of the ways in which the
universe communicates

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.060 align:middle line:90%
to all of us, you and all of us.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you'll
flow into how

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.820 align:middle line:84%
do you discern what
is for you, what

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:84%
is significant, versus something
that seems to be random?

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Sure.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.530 align:middle line:84%
I think that the misconception
is that certain people are

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.770 align:middle line:84%
special, and they get the
messages and others don't.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But the fact of the
matter is, the universe

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is speaking to each
and every one of us

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:90%
all of the time, all day long.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
one sign or symbol.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a coincidence.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It's not that random
synchronicity.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.620 align:middle line:84%
We literally are getting
the dots every single day

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.260 align:middle line:84%
to the point that the
universe is giving us

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:90%
paragraphs of information.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.590 align:middle line:84%
I got paragraphs
just on the way here.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And so what we have to
allow ourselves to do

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:30.410 align:middle line:84%
is just be aware, aware of where
our eye lands, aware of what

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.860 align:middle line:84%
conversation shows
up repeatedly,

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.700 align:middle line:84%
aware of the thing that seems
to continuously show up in a way

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.870 align:middle line:84%
that we keep saying, oh my
goodness, there that is, again.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.630 align:middle line:84%
That's where we get the
initial conversations.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.780 align:middle line:84%
And once we get that
something is showing up

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.470 align:middle line:84%
for us, if instead of
trying to figure it out,

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
we just stop and think about
what we just thought about,

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:84%
go into what we just
felt, we're going

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.575 align:middle line:84%
to discover that
where we were was

00:32:58.575 --> 00:33:01.220 align:middle line:84%
a choice, a choice
between something that

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.400 align:middle line:84%
is totally illogical,
completely creative,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.930 align:middle line:84%
fully from the heart and soul
that makes no sense at all.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.315 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
it is going to require

00:33:11.315 --> 00:33:13.669 align:middle line:84%
us to be more than
we've ever had.

00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Or the other side is going to
be the side of us that talks us

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.940 align:middle line:84%
out of it, that tells us
how it's not practical,

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and how we need to get a grip.

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:24.350 align:middle line:84%
And what we tend to do is
we fall to that mind side

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.110 align:middle line:84%
rather than following
the pixie dust that's

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:29.060 align:middle line:84%
trying to lead us
somewhere else.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:33.260 align:middle line:84%
And if we would trust in the
gut and follow that direction,

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.900 align:middle line:84%
the signs will
continue to show up.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they basically mean
the universe has your back.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:38.990 align:middle line:90%
We're opening the doors.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:40.080 align:middle line:90%
We're leading the way.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.374 align:middle line:90%
Just come.

00:33:41.374 --> 00:33:42.290 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And I notice this in
so many different ways.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.360 align:middle line:84%
It might be taking a walk,
and suddenly a light bulb.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm contemplating something,
and a light bulb goes on

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.300 align:middle line:90%
and I have a particular thought.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And at the moment,
I may not realize

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:56.630 align:middle line:90%
how important that thought is.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And three ravens fly
overhead and caw three times

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:00.880 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Exactly.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.715 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Those
kinds of things.

00:34:02.715 --> 00:34:09.449 align:middle line:84%
Or even, in my case, I
have tones and chords

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:11.130 align:middle line:90%
that are always present.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.389 align:middle line:84%
And so if there's, again,
an idea that has meaning,

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:18.330 align:middle line:84%
the sound will dip down
into a very low, low range

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:21.578 align:middle line:84%
until it gets my attention,
what was I just thinking about?

00:34:21.578 --> 00:34:23.744 align:middle line:84%
And boom, it goes back up
into the really high range

00:34:23.744 --> 00:34:24.436 align:middle line:90%
of frequency.

00:34:24.436 --> 00:34:26.560 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: It shows up in
all those beautiful ways--

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.406 align:middle line:84%
in books, and words,
and greeting cards.

00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And someone
giving you a message.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.447 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: So when somebody's
saying something to you,

00:34:32.447 --> 00:34:35.219 align:middle line:84%
a person showing up in your life
that has that personality that

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.120 align:middle line:84%
you've just not been
able to deal with,

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.589 align:middle line:84%
even more so the obstacles--
a solenoid that doesn't work,

00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:45.460 align:middle line:84%
a computer that crashes,
a piece of a car, a tire,

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.929 align:middle line:90%
a pipe bursting in the house.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:50.260 align:middle line:84%
What if those are all symbols
and messages of something,

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and that it's not actually
the issue that happens,

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.810 align:middle line:90%
but it's the subtleties of it?

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.160 align:middle line:84%
What does a pipe
inside the walls mean?

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:84%
What is a flood
inside the basement

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.850 align:middle line:84%
actually trying to tell you
about you and the next step?

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.020 align:middle line:84%
But we go into the
negative thinking about it.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.680 align:middle line:90%
We go into the why me?

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:84%
Oh my God, this is going
to cost another fortune.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:84%
We go into that
place rather than

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:84%
staying in the
wonder of the child,

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and the curiosity of what
is the universe bringing me?

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.800 align:middle line:84%
What's the surprise
in the Cracker Jack

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.770 align:middle line:84%
box that's in front
of me right now?

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And when we stay in
that place, which

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
is so much of where I take
people in my second book,

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
Your Journey to
Enlightenment, it's

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.725 align:middle line:84%
about going back into that
perspective of the child--

00:35:31.725 --> 00:35:36.215 align:middle line:84%
not childlike-- not
childish, childlike.

00:35:36.215 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Childlike.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, entering the
gates of heaven--

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.570 align:middle line:84%
in the Christian
tradition, for example--

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:44.990 align:middle line:84%
to be childlike this
the path to that.

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And what you say, I
think, is absolutely true.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And most people have had that
beaten out of them by the time

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:54.330 align:middle line:84%
they're-- well, now probably
five or six years old,

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.020 align:middle line:84%
being so burdened with so many
things they have to achieve

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.170 align:middle line:90%
and accomplish.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to a
man behind the counter

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.820 align:middle line:90%
in a store the other day.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%
He was just talking
about his child.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.210 align:middle line:84%
He was-- actually, he
was making an espresso.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And I overheard him in a
conversation saying, yeah.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.480 align:middle line:84%
And another man, a
friend, was saying, "Well,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.120 align:middle line:84%
how's your child
doing, your son?"

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.540 align:middle line:90%
And he said, "Oh, you know.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:84%
He's six years old, but he has
so much homework on weekends."

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:90%
I was just aghast.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Do you have to
leave him in that environment?"

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:26.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Is that
a public school?"

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.490 align:middle line:84%
He said "Yes, that's
public school."

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I've been
fighting and fighting.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And they keep trying to
put him in special ed

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.210 align:middle line:84%
because he can't do this
much homework at six."

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:36.440 align:middle line:90%
That's where it begins.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.740 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Regina, that's the
whole point of the Rebel Road.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:84%
The person that I
gave permission to

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.050 align:middle line:84%
was that little seven-year-old
that was behind the curtain.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I said, go play.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.370 align:middle line:90%
Go be on stage.

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:90%
Sing your song.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Act out.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:53.190 align:middle line:90%
Do whatever you want to do.

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.856 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do what
you didn't get to do.

00:36:54.856 --> 00:36:56.620 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Right now,
I love you enough.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:58.070 align:middle line:90%
I see you.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:02.910 align:middle line:84%
I want you to go and have your
year to fully express yourself,

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to build your
confidence, to understand

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.860 align:middle line:84%
pieces and parts of
yourself you've never seen.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.330 align:middle line:84%
When do we give
that to ourselves?

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I discovered--
because I can honestly

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.920 align:middle line:84%
tell you, the whole
step of the way.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And even now?

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I had absolutely no
idea what I was doing.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I would show up at a
show, and I would sing.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.460 align:middle line:90%
And the voice became weak.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.712 align:middle line:84%
And as I continued
through shows,

00:37:23.712 --> 00:37:24.920 align:middle line:90%
it got stronger and stronger.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.820 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Because
you weren't a singer.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: I wasn't a singer.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:31.240 align:middle line:84%
But we are here as experience
experiencing itself.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Experience experiencing
itself means

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.249 align:middle line:84%
that we go through
the experience

00:37:35.249 --> 00:37:36.290 align:middle line:90%
to get to the other side.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:39.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't make it about an
agenda or about an audience,

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.790 align:middle line:84%
or how many chairs
we can fill up,

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.840 align:middle line:84%
or how much money goes
in the bank account.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.630 align:middle line:90%
That's not what a child does.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.080 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a
child, we're all

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.440 align:middle line:84%
hyped up about the
law of attraction.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what child is out
there doing vision boards?

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.305 align:middle line:84%
Tell me, what child is out
there stating affirmations?

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I don't see any
children doing that.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.060 align:middle line:90%
But I see them manifesting.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's because they dream.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.870 align:middle line:90%
There in their imagination.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.860 align:middle line:84%
They're in their
excitement and their play.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what we've
forgotten as adults.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.440 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: That's
what we've forgotten.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's how
everything is created.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.195 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:38:08.195 --> 00:38:10.320 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: For me, it's
when I'm driving somewhere,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.436 align:middle line:84%
just daydreaming of an outcome--
not about how I get there,

00:38:13.436 --> 00:38:16.060 align:middle line:84%
just the outcome of what I want
it to be like on the other end.

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Just having fun, just
oh, isn't that great?

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.670 align:middle line:90%
That feels so good.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And boom, it usually happens.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.976 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: And that's
what we're in our hearts.

00:38:23.976 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:90%
That's when we're in the now.

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Too many of us are
living in the future,

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.470 align:middle line:84%
trying to reach an
agenda that we don't even

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:30.910 align:middle line:90%
know if it's going to come.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:33.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we wonder why
time passes so fast,

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:84%
or we wonder why we age,
and why we get sick.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.915 align:middle line:84%
It's because we're not present
to our own beingness of what

00:38:38.915 --> 00:38:40.310 align:middle line:90%
our heart wants right now.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And that's the
real critical key is desire.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.330 align:middle line:84%
The desire of the heart is
different than a desire driven

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:51.850 align:middle line:84%
by that emptiness, driven
by societal perceptions.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.910 align:middle line:84%
A lot of religions put desire
at the bottom of the list.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:58.390 align:middle line:84%
We must release
desire from our lives

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:90%
to reach the Kingdoms of God.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Without desire, a child
accomplishes nothing.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:84%
They wake up excited and
thrilled with a desire

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to maybe paint something,
or run outside and play.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a
desire that you want

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.560 align:middle line:84%
to make someone else
happy for the day,

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.930 align:middle line:84%
however it expresses
itself, it's all desire.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:84%
And without desire,
nothing is created.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And yet our society punishes
desire on one level,

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and then rewards it in a
really sick way on another.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: That's just it.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And children know to immerse
themselves in that desire.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.205 align:middle line:84%
They know to fully engage
in whatever experience

00:39:35.205 --> 00:39:36.890 align:middle line:90%
that shows up.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.350 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of my book,
I talk about how

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.590 align:middle line:90%
we're in a playground.

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Earth is not meant to be a
school or an obstacle course.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.060 align:middle line:90%
It's meant to be a playground.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And everything we
experience-- whether it

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:51.070 align:middle line:84%
is grief, or sadness, or
jealousy, or upset, or joy,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:53.540 align:middle line:84%
or bliss, or giggles
and laughter, they're

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.150 align:middle line:90%
all parts of the playground.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.160 align:middle line:90%
It's just all experiences.

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And what children can show us
is when they are deeply immersed

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.671 align:middle line:84%
in a temper tantrum--
like my three-year-old

00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:05.795 align:middle line:84%
can get sometimes-- and
he's kicking and screaming,

00:40:05.795 --> 00:40:09.050 align:middle line:84%
and eyes are streaming with
tears, and his face is red

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.570 align:middle line:90%
and he's sweaty and hot.

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.110 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, he's in the
ecstasy of that emotion,

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.770 align:middle line:90%
in the pure ecstasy of it.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:18.530 align:middle line:84%
He's in that moment,
fully feeling it.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And then a few seconds later,
an airplane will fly by,

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.380 align:middle line:84%
and his arms will be
completely spread out.

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.760 align:middle line:84%
He'll be zooming
around the yard.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.220 align:middle line:90%
He'll be giggling and laughing.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And then he's in the
ecstasy of his joy.

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.790 align:middle line:90%
But we adults don't do that.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:33.870 align:middle line:84%
We suppress our
emotions, and then we

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.606 align:middle line:84%
wonder why we can feel
the height of joy.

00:40:35.606 --> 00:40:38.105 align:middle line:84%
It's because we haven't felt
the depth of our other anguish.

00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:40.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Or we wonder why they
come out inappropriately down

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:40.850 align:middle line:90%
the road.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Exactly, exactly.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we carry
our stuff everywhere we go.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.590 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time you saw
a child playing on the slide.

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And then saw the merry
go round and decided

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.740 align:middle line:84%
to play on the merry
go round, but picked up

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.770 align:middle line:84%
the slide to carry it to
the merry go round to play?

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what we do with all
of our life circumstances,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.410 align:middle line:84%
with all of our relationships,
with all of our wounds.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:84%
We pick them up to go
play in the next place.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.670 align:middle line:90%
And we're not supposed to,.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We're just supposed to play
where we are, and then go

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:08.190 align:middle line:90%
play somewhere else.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely,
I couldn't agree more.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And so the picture that
you're painting now

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.060 align:middle line:84%
is that the sacred
universe-- and it

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:19.150 align:middle line:84%
is sacred and symbolic and
alive with creativity--

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.790 align:middle line:90%
is speaking to us all the time.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So you've been listening
and you've been following.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.400 align:middle line:84%
But one of those
components is how we also

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.770 align:middle line:84%
need to listen to that
information coming

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:30.220 align:middle line:90%
from within our bodies.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a moment.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: There are
no teachers and gurus.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a time that they
all have to disappear.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the only person that
is to guide us is ourselves.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And the person that we
need to most listen to

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:84%
is that child inside,
what that child needs,

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:47.040 align:middle line:84%
what that child wants, how
that child can teach, and lead,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.130 align:middle line:90%
and guide.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.887 align:middle line:84%
And we've put people
up on these pedestals

00:41:49.887 --> 00:41:51.470 align:middle line:84%
thinking that they're
going to give us

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.690 align:middle line:84%
the process, or the protocol,
or the book, or the movie,

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.520 align:middle line:84%
or the idea that is
going to free us,

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.822 align:middle line:84%
when the fact of the matter is
we've created our own prisons.

00:42:00.822 --> 00:42:02.780 align:middle line:84%
We've created our own
bondage and our servitude

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:06.460 align:middle line:84%
by exactly what we've decided
to believe and conform to.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:84%
So if we let ourselves
release that seriousness,

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and we let ourselves
understand that we are just

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
as special as everyone
else-- and not so--

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.260 align:middle line:84%
and we can just live being
experience experiencing itself

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.780 align:middle line:84%
from the perspective and the
vision of a child in wonder,

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.730 align:middle line:84%
a childlike innocence
that says, let

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
me see what the universe
wants to play with me today.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And dive into our careers,
our religions, our families,

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.040 align:middle line:84%
our work spaces and our play
spaces, in that consciousness,

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.180 align:middle line:84%
then all of a sudden
we're in the now.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
things start working.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:44.400 align:middle line:84%
When was the last time you
saw kids go on a playground

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.450 align:middle line:84%
and not make friends
with every other child?

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.100 align:middle line:90%
They innately do that.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.780 align:middle line:90%
We adults create war.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.147 align:middle line:84%
We adults create
sickness and separation.

00:42:52.147 --> 00:42:54.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So let's talk about
the sickness, separation,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and how the body reflects
back what the child,

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.260 align:middle line:90%
or what the soul, wishes.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: We create
conversations with ourselves

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.710 align:middle line:90%
in terms of illness and aging.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.640 align:middle line:84%
We create signs and
symbols, and all the ways

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.590 align:middle line:84%
that our lives
start to deteriorate

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.140 align:middle line:84%
from our body outwardly
to our bank accounts

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and our home lives
and our relationships.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.110 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that I
discovered on this Rebel Road

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.350 align:middle line:84%
is I found the
fountain of youth.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.385 align:middle line:84%
Staying in that place of
excitement and wonder,

00:43:22.385 --> 00:43:24.950 align:middle line:84%
staying in that place of,
right now in this moment,

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go put on a show.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And I can't wait to see what
comes out to my mouth today,

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.790 align:middle line:84%
or who's going to be there,
or what amazing magic is going

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:35.200 align:middle line:84%
to pop up in front of me,
imprinted into my cells

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.470 align:middle line:90%
aliveness.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:37.750 align:middle line:90%
We're not here to live.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:39.092 align:middle line:90%
We're here to be alive.

00:43:39.092 --> 00:43:39.800 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.040 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: It imprinted
an aliveness and a zest

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.880 align:middle line:84%
that's like champagne bubbles
sparkling and bursting

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.220 align:middle line:90%
throughout my system.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And I watched my skin change.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.720 align:middle line:90%
I watched my health improve.

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.670 align:middle line:90%
I watched myself get younger.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I look younger today
than I did 20 years ago.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I have anti-aged.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:00.080 align:middle line:84%
Who needs the Botox
or the energy drinks?

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.080 align:middle line:84%
We just need to go live our
passions and our dreams.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:04.395 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:44:04.395 --> 00:44:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, another thing
you talk about

00:44:06.350 --> 00:44:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that this is a
very meaty subject

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.870 align:middle line:84%
is that we need a new
story of creation.

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:14.870 align:middle line:90%
We need a new creation story.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:16.390 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.780 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.260 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: We need to move into
a place where we comprehend

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.820 align:middle line:84%
the beauty of the light and the
dark, the fear and the love,

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.780 align:middle line:84%
the shadows that
created us where we are.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Because that was the
ember where we began.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.710 align:middle line:84%
You can't see the
light in light,

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:35.650 align:middle line:90%
but you can see it in the dark.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:38.525 align:middle line:84%
And what is required
now is the bridging

00:44:38.525 --> 00:44:41.240 align:middle line:84%
of the shame and the
guilt and the insecurities

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.000 align:middle line:84%
that we have all felt,
and understanding

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.310 align:middle line:90%
how holy and sacred they are.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:48.680 align:middle line:84%
We are each a sacred text
walking, no different

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.840 align:middle line:84%
than the Quran or the
Torah or the Bible

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.880 align:middle line:90%
or any other sacred text.

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.130 align:middle line:90%
We have wisdom that we carry.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:59.370 align:middle line:84%
We have story that
we've made up.

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're good at
making up those stories.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of other
stuff that we just made up.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And that is the sacred
text that we are walking.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting here as a
conversation with the universe

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:09.850 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:11.180 align:middle line:90%
My name is Simran.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And Simran means, from
the lips of the divine

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:15.180 align:middle line:90%
to the ears of the divine.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.000 align:middle line:84%
From the lips of the divine,
to the ears of the divine,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.300 align:middle line:84%
from the lips of the divine
to the ears of the divine.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.040 align:middle line:84%
We are each gods walking, sons
and daughters of creation.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And we are intended here
to constantly create.

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:31.380 align:middle line:84%
It is our birthright, our
universal divine right,

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.800 align:middle line:84%
as that son or
daughter of creation.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you're feeling stuck,
if life's not working,

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.410 align:middle line:84%
if it hurts, if
it's hard, life's

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.030 align:middle line:90%
not supposed to feel that way.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.090 align:middle line:84%
It means that it's time
to create something.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:43.350 align:middle line:90%
It's time to birth.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.150 align:middle line:84%
And this whole moment
of April is just

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:47.910 align:middle line:90%
asking you to birth who you are.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The birthing canal,
we're in the birthing canal

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:51.540 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And that is a lot
of pressure, and you

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.562 align:middle line:84%
don't know what's
on the other side.

00:45:55.562 --> 00:45:57.770 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: And that's the
beauty, because the unknown,

00:45:57.770 --> 00:46:00.430 align:middle line:84%
people think, is a
dark and scary place.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.950 align:middle line:84%
But they think that because
they've identified themselves

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.350 align:middle line:90%
with just this body.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.760 align:middle line:84%
The unknown is actually
everything outside of you

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.340 align:middle line:84%
that you are, because
you are all of it.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk for a
moment, before we wrap up,

00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.230 align:middle line:84%
about the 11:11,
your radio show,

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:18.387 align:middle line:84%
and also where you are on the
Rebel Road tour right now.

00:46:18.387 --> 00:46:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Yes.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.460 align:middle line:90%
I create 11:11 talk radio.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And it is an amazing
show that I just

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.110 align:middle line:84%
continuously
explore with people.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:27.880 align:middle line:90%
I also create 11:11 magazine.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.140 align:middle line:84%
That is my gift to
humanity, that's

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.956 align:middle line:84%
filled to just share
voices with people

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.580 align:middle line:84%
from around the world
that have wisdom.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Because we all have it.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And on the Rebel Road, I'm
finishing up the last leg.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.670 align:middle line:84%
We have about five
events left, and I'll

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:42.800 align:middle line:90%
be doing those in June.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.130 align:middle line:84%
So people can continue to
follow through the daily diary

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:47.750 align:middle line:90%
that I do on YouTube.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.630 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, what a
beautiful thing it is that you

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.830 align:middle line:84%
have the name Simran, and
it means what it means,

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:55.050 align:middle line:90%
and you're living fully.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:57.304 align:middle line:84%
And you're a wonderful
example to others.

00:46:57.304 --> 00:46:59.470 align:middle line:84%
I really appreciate your
taking the time to do this.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:00.780 align:middle line:90%
It was really good meeting you.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Oh, thank you, Regina.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.690 align:middle line:10%
I think the message that I
want people to have most of all

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.980 align:middle line:10%
is that if we can begin to live
our lives without an agenda,

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.890 align:middle line:10%
if we can get out of
these thoughts of I've

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.040 align:middle line:10%
got to make money, I've
got to create a product,

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:15.840 align:middle line:10%
I've got to sell certain things,
I've got to create a list.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.440 align:middle line:10%
If we can get out of all that
stuff, because that's just

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.980 align:middle line:10%
the same paradigm languaged
in a different way.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:21.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You bet.

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.790 align:middle line:84%
>> SINGH: Then all of a sudden,
we're going to start to really

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:26.400 align:middle line:84%
know our power, and we're
really going to collaborate.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Not this thing that
we call collaboration,

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.040 align:middle line:84%
but we're really going to
collaborate collectively.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:32.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we will
see that new dawn.

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:35.390 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well, that's when
you start drawing in quite

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.950 align:middle line:10%
naturally and organically
your family of participants

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:39.630 align:middle line:10%
in cocreation.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.546 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: The fractal.

00:47:40.546 --> 00:47:42.020 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Absolutely,
the fractal.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.027 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:43.860 align:middle line:90%
>> SINGH: Thank you.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.780 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: The name of
Simran's book is Your Journey

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.270 align:middle line:10%

gained traction among many

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.899 align:middle line:10%
of the authors in this
genre as well as readers.
