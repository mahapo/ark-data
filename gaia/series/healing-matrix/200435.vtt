>>SUE MORTER: When
is depression a mask

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.940 align:middle line:10%
for the lack of soul purpose?

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:10%
Is it possible that the
universe can and will

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:10%
urge us into finding our truth?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And it will even throw
us curveballs of crisis

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.980 align:middle line:84%
until we wake up and
step into our purpose.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
Psychotherapist Dr. Toni
Galardi thought she had it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
all figured out until her
life began to fall apart.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.735 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at her story.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Toni Galardi, the
daughter of an Italian

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.400 align:middle line:84%
immigrant and
American-German mother,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.520 align:middle line:84%
fit the mold she had been raised
to believe was the definition

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.980 align:middle line:84%
of success for the first
30 years of her life.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
She married a successful
Italian-Catholic man

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.060 align:middle line:84%
in her early 20s, owned a
spacious house in California,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:84%
and completed her
education to become

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:90%
a successful psychotherapist.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Four years into this
dream, a growing discontent

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:90%
turned into a deep depression.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:84%
She had outgrown her
marriage and no longer

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.280 align:middle line:84%
believed traditional
psychotherapy worked.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
But she held on,
trying to keep living

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.460 align:middle line:84%
in both of these realities until
a series of three car accidents

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.970 align:middle line:90%
in one week changed everything.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.860 align:middle line:84%
During her neck
injury rehab, she

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.920 align:middle line:84%
met Jacquelyn Small, a
pioneer of addiction recovery

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.260 align:middle line:90%
and transpersonal psychology.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.500 align:middle line:84%
From that moment, Dr.
Galardi was never the same.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:10%
She left her husband, left
her home, sold her practice,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:10%
and moved to Los Angeles.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.350 align:middle line:84%
She hosted a cable talk
show, interviewing pioneers

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.110 align:middle line:84%
in their fields who had left
their old lives to blaze

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:90%
new trails with a guest.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
When she wasn't
hosting the show,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:84%
she was beginning to experience
visions of a new world

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and the seven stages of a new
human transformation model.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
During this time, she met her
first mentor, Barbara Marx

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:90%
Hubbard.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.550 align:middle line:10%
Barbara encouraged and
validated the new world

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.500 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Toni was seeing.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Just when her career
was taking off,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Galardi became sick and
fatigued with Epstein-Barr.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, she was hit
with a deadly mold poisoning

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.110 align:middle line:84%
and was forced to leave
her contaminated home

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and possessions behind.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
Even while she was sick
and living out of a hotel,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
she forged forward with
her mission and work.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:84%
She has been a
professional speaker

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.070 align:middle line:84%
an author for over 25 years
on the subject of mastering

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:84%
change, resilience,
addiction recovery,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.010 align:middle line:84%
and discovering
one's soul purpose.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Now known as the
"LifeQuake Doctor,"

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:84%
Tony Galardi speaks and
coaches across the country,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
preparing major
corporations and individuals

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for and
embrace change.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:90%


00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.670 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being on the
"Healing Matrix" with us today.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TONI GALARDI: Thank
you for having me.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, I
understand that you've

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
had several near-death or
near-fatal experiences.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a
little bit about that?

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:10%
>>GALARDI: Sure.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.980 align:middle line:10%
So the first one was
when I was working

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:10%
on Skid Row just out of college
and Downtown Los Angeles.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And a feeling in my
body was telling me

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.630 align:middle line:84%
I needed to leave this
job, that violence was

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:90%
starting to come to Skid Row.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And I told my boss, I think
we need a security guard.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we don't
need a security guard.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:90%
Everything's going to be fine.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And one week later, a junkie
got through screening.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.610 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't know he was high.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:10%
And I tried to escort
him out of the facility.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:10%
And he took me by the throat
and tried to choke me to death.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And if not for the miracle
assistance of a woman

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%
who is a Russian doctor--

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and she was the one
who came to my rescue.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.980 align:middle line:84%
All the men in the room went
into complete paralysis.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And she started
yanking on his arm.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:84%
He threw me one way against
the wall, threw her another.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And when I ended
up at the hospital,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I had handprints on
my neck from the--

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:84%
so that was the first neck
injury that I incurred.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.329 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then you
sustained further injuries--

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.079 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Seven years later.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.287 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --with car accidents--

00:04:21.287 --> 00:04:24.530 align:middle line:84%
I know multiple car accidents--
in a short period of time.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a
little bit about that?

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we're trying some
big things together here.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Seven years
later, I had married the man

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.510 align:middle line:84%
that I was engaged to at that
time, moved to Orange County,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.750 align:middle line:84%
went to grad school, went
into private practice,

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.330 align:middle line:84%
was then becoming
very discontented

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.910 align:middle line:84%
with the medical model
I'd been trained in,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.090 align:middle line:90%
that this did not heal people.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.520 align:middle line:84%
It was a model for
long-term, long-term therapy.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting
to become depressed.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.280 align:middle line:84%
There were these two
parallel lives beginning.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I had started the "Course in
Miracles" and was waking up,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.220 align:middle line:90%
had left Catholicism.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what was
next spiritually for me.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And so literally, my psyche
was starting to split in two

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and trying to hold
on to that life I had

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and the security of the marriage
and career and the practice.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.980 align:middle line:84%
In a period of six days, I
was in three car accidents.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the third accident, I
actually wasn't even driving.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:84%
I was in the backseat
in the middle,

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.420 align:middle line:84%
where it's supposed to be
safe next to my godmother

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:90%
and mother.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So in six days, you
had three car accidents--

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: That's correct.

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --two which
you were driving,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.350 align:middle line:90%
one you were a passenger.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.613 align:middle line:90%
Something's going on here.

00:05:32.613 --> 00:05:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going
to get into that.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.697 align:middle line:84%
But I just want to
back up for a moment.

00:05:35.697 --> 00:05:37.870 align:middle line:84%
You said that your
psyche started to split.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.223 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share
for our viewers

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:41.890 align:middle line:84%
what a statement like
that means and how

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.610 align:middle line:84%
someone might be able to
relate to something like that?

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So our ego is
really comprised of everything

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.230 align:middle line:84%
we've learned, all the
programming we were raised with

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
and we've taken in
from the culture.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And when I believe
the soul decides

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that this is no
longer authentic, when

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
you reach a completion, I think
of it the way the Phoenix bird

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:90%
myth--

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
is that when a bird has
flown as high as it can fly,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.030 align:middle line:84%
it consciously
douses itself down

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.940 align:middle line:84%
into the fire to be consumed
into ashes to reconstruct

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:90%
into higher form.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I started studying
quantum theory, in which

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE] theory of chaos.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.720 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
thing from science--

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.690 align:middle line:84%
and seeing that there is
something here to this death

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:90%
rebirth that is part of life.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And yet it still was many years
of more security-bound life

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.190 align:middle line:84%
choices that led to me having
to have another actually

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.600 align:middle line:90%
near-fatal experience.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In your world,
you mentioned depression.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So you were
significantly depressed.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
You were then going into
rehab for the neck injuries.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And something started
to weave together.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
You found a different
way to find your path.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.890 align:middle line:90%
Can you say more about that?

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So because I'm
passionate about helping people

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.760 align:middle line:84%
prepare for change,
the seven-stage model

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that I developed
begins with boredom.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Had I been able to
really ascertain

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.870 align:middle line:84%
when I was bored in the
first stage of the model,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
which is-- boredom
is the middle.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.542 align:middle line:84%
In the emotional
tone scale, boredom

00:07:21.542 --> 00:07:22.750 align:middle line:90%
is right there in the middle.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:90%
Despair is at the bottom.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:90%
Ecstasy is at the top.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:84%
If we make a change
when we start

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
to see this is no longer
viable in our lives,

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.790 align:middle line:84%
we will move up that
emotional tone scale.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.420 align:middle line:84%
If we do not make a change, like
I didn't, and we keep trying

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
to do the same thing the same
way, maybe self-medicating--

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:84%
I was drinking two glasses
of wine every night--

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
then we start to move down
into clinical depression,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
except it's not really
clinical depression.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritually
driven depression.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's a
spiritual crisis

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:84%
because the soulful
self is trying

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
to come up out of this false
self that we've orchestrated.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And one way or another, it's
going to get that job done.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to--

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
how were you functioning
with all of this rehab

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
and trying to drink at
night to get through?

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And right in there, you
decided to leave your marriage.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:84%
You decided to make
these major life choices.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:84%
If I recall, you
left your marriage.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:90%
You quit your job.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:90%
You moved out.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:90%
You were on the move.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
This soul was on the move
to find its true path.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.929 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get into what
unfolded for you as a solution.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But these moments where we're
making these life decisions

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:44.220 align:middle line:84%
are so important for our viewers
to be able to say, that's me.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's what I'm
going through right now.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And it might be
able to save them

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:84%
from having to do such
radical things that we did

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.135 align:middle line:84%
to find our true path
if we can kind of pave

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:56.010 align:middle line:90%
the way a little bit.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So can you just say
a little bit more

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.510 align:middle line:84%
about what was going on in
your life in that moment,

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.500 align:middle line:90%
how you were feeling?

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.170 align:middle line:84%
What was happening inside
of you that allowed

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.160 align:middle line:90%
you to make these decisions?

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So I was
losing a lot of weight.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
I was still, even after
those car accidents,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.460 align:middle line:90%
trying to stay in my marriage.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:90%
I made a vow.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And for me at that time,
when you make a commitment

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.790 align:middle line:90%
to something, you keep it.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
paradigm I was raised in.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I was losing
a lot of weight.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.340 align:middle line:84%
But this weird spiritual thing
was happening at the same time.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And I went on to actually give
a workshop because there's

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.810 align:middle line:84%
nothing in the DSM,
the diagnostic manual

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:84%
in our profession, that talks
about spiritual anorexia, which

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:90%
is--

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the weight loss is
because you're actually

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.030 align:middle line:90%
leaving your body.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's what was happening.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.117 align:middle line:84%
I looked like a
child in many ways.

00:09:42.117 --> 00:09:43.200 align:middle line:90%
And I was leaving my body.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you were leaving
the old pattern of view

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
in order to discover
a new pattern of you,

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.025 align:middle line:84%
a deeper, more authentic
pattern of you.

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:51.150 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, you were also
diagnosed with Epstein-Barr

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.250 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Was it right in that
same time frame?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: The Epstein-Barr
came, actually, later.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:90%
It was interesting.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:84%
What came first was-- after
I moved to Los Angeles,

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.220 align:middle line:90%
I was invited to join a group.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.630 align:middle line:90%
This was divine coincidence.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:90%
I talk about that term--

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
to be paying attention when
you're in these early stages

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.910 align:middle line:90%
before you have to hit the wall.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
What are the
breadcrumbs to follow?

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.890 align:middle line:90%
How are you being guided?

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And I was invited to a group
called the Inside Edge.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Jack Canfield was on the
board, Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:90%
They had formed this board.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And in joining that group,
I went to a conference

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:90%
at Asilomar.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And at that conference,
Humanistic Psychology

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Conference, I met
Alberto Villoldo,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.667 align:middle line:84%
who was a Cuban
psychologist into shamanism.

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was the first time I've
heard of this word "shamanism."

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was wanting to find
out, what are the new ways?

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.180 align:middle line:84%
There's got to be another way to
heal people than this long-term

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:90%
model I'd been raised--

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I've been trained in.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:84%
So he started showing me
these pictures and films

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
of shamans in Peru
and in Ecuador

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:84%
and what they were doing
and how they could heal

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.230 align:middle line:90%
people almost instantaneously.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And from that was when I
started to explore shamanism

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%
and went to Peru myself.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so at
this moment, what

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
did you think was happening
within you at the time?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.150 align:middle line:84%
Before you were exposed
to these solutions

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that the shamanism was bringing
forward, you're in this state.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.590 align:middle line:90%
You're losing weight.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:20.940 align:middle line:90%
You're not satisfied.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Your old life isn't working.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't know
where you're headed.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what's next.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And what did you
think was going on?

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.655 align:middle line:84%
Did you think you
were losing it?

00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: I was terrified.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:29.580 align:middle line:90%
I was terrified.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And there were these words
that were coming to me.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Lose your mind and
come to your senses.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Fritz Perls, who was the
father of gestalt psychology,

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.250 align:middle line:90%
used to say that.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And I had done two years
of gestalt psychology.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.730 align:middle line:90%
So I was hearing this.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Lose your mind and
come to your senses.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And then I came
across a book that

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:90%
saved my life, Joan Halifax--

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.810 align:middle line:84%
"Shaman," the path of
the wounded healer.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was describing
what was happening to me.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
In a tribe, when one person
has a schizophrenic break

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
in the tribe, they
throw that-- they

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.320 align:middle line:84%
think of that person
as the tribal shaman,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.490 align:middle line:90%
the new tribal shaman.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.010 align:middle line:84%
So they're thrown out into
the desert or the forest

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to basically make
it on their own.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the visions
start to come through.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have a context
for that in our society.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.140 align:middle line:90%
We lock people up.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Or we medicate them when
they start cracking up.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And so if it weren't for--

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.230 align:middle line:84%
I had a deep spiritual
core that came

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:84%
from Catholicism that had to do
with my connection to spirit.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.660 align:middle line:84%
My first communion, I had a
full-body Kundalini experience

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:90%
receiving communion.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.095 align:middle line:84%
But no one else had had that
experience, so I shut it down.

00:12:35.095 --> 00:12:37.470 align:middle line:84%
All the other little girls
looked at me like I was weird.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:90%
So I had shut that down.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.000 align:middle line:90%
So this started blasting open.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was starting
to have these visions

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
again, only I had a context
now because Joan's book

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and remembering my
Jungian training

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and Jung talking about--
because I had an experience

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
after a yoga retreat of
falling through a void

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and literally going
dead to the world.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.180 align:middle line:90%
My period stopped.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.640 align:middle line:90%
I was only 30 years old.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.520 align:middle line:84%
My period stopped
for nine months.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:84%
And it was a best chiropractor
who brought me back.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Seriously?

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.963 align:middle line:84%
So you spoke about
spiritual depression.

00:13:11.963 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's make that
distinction for people--

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.350 align:middle line:84%
clinical depression,
spiritual depression.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.240 align:middle line:84%
The viewer might be saying, all
I know is I don't feel good.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.880 align:middle line:90%
I feel disconnected.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.840 align:middle line:90%
I feel suppressed.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:84%
What I'm feeling
inside doesn't match

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:90%
what's going on on the outside.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.720 align:middle line:84%
How do I know the difference
between spiritual depression

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.010 align:middle line:90%
or clinical depression?

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this is happening with me.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: It's
a great question.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
So there is an onset there's a
difference between someone who

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.170 align:middle line:84%
has had chronic depression
throughout their lives

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:47.500 align:middle line:84%
and a clear onset where life no
longer has the meaning it once

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.550 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And the term that
best describes this--

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.760 align:middle line:84%
I call it the "cosmic
barbecue" in my book.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
But John of the Cross,
the Christian mystic,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
called it the "dark
night of the soul."

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:84%
When the ego is splitting from
this reality as an identity

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.790 align:middle line:84%
and is now moving
toward the soul,

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:90%
everything out there looks dark.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why things like "The
Abraham Work" is wonderful.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:84%
"The Science of
Mind" is wonderful.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:20.200 align:middle line:84%
But when you are in that kind
of soul retrieval journey work,

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:84%
none of that's going
to work for you.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to feel
bad because it doesn't work.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
What my work is about
when I work with people,

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.710 align:middle line:84%
either individually
or in groups,

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
is to sit with the
emotions because there's

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.190 align:middle line:90%
a death process going on.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.410 align:middle line:90%
Everything that you were--

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.640 align:middle line:90%
you are dying.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's about conscious dying.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:44.760 align:middle line:84%
How do you consciously die
to the life you had before?

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And part of that is
sitting with emotions,

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
then bringing in a you--

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.000 align:middle line:90%
what I call the "holy self"--

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:84%
bringing that into this body
and sitting with those emotions

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.510 align:middle line:90%
to transmute you.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I can't agree more that we
have to come home to ourselves.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.110 align:middle line:84%
We have to come in
here and let what

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
we're feeling be felt
instead of pushing it away

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.800 align:middle line:84%
or medicating it down and
ignoring the fact that it's

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.700 align:middle line:84%
actually a very valuable part
of our awakening of our process

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.320 align:middle line:90%
of setting ourselves free.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So I'm thrilled to
hear you saying this.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thrilled
that you're working

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
with people through your
LifeQuake program in such

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.130 align:middle line:90%
a fashion.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us what LifeQuake
is and just share a little bit

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.500 align:middle line:90%
about that with our viewers?

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So a LifeQuake,
on the individual level,

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is the labor pains
of a soul waking up

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.770 align:middle line:84%
to the next level
of its evolution.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:10%
The LifeQuake phenomenon is
the collective experience

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.890 align:middle line:10%
that I see as an unprecedented,
extraordinary sociological

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:10%
event taking place in which
a critical mass of humanity

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.980 align:middle line:10%
has decided to learn
how to adapt and thrive

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.397 align:middle line:10%
in the midst of
accelerated change

00:15:55.397 --> 00:15:57.313 align:middle line:10%
because that's what's
happening on the planet.

00:15:57.313 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You bet.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
We're not in the
middle of a problem.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.162 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle
of an invitation.

00:16:01.162 --> 00:16:02.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yes.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're in an
invitation to awaken.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, in your quaking,
as you describe it--

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
I love the description,
LifeQuake--

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.900 align:middle line:84%
what is-- and I know we've
spoken to this a little bit.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.370 align:middle line:90%
But let's just clarify.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
actually quaking?

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:90%
What's breaking apart?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.497 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: The faulty programs.

00:16:17.497 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: The faulty program.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So the false self, the
illusionary world, the me

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
that I think I'm
supposed to be is not

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
going to suffice because of
where I'm headed in my life.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And so this has to break apart
and let something else rise.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Is this-- am I getting it?

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yes.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I get it.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So how is this different than
traditional psychotherapy,

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.520 align:middle line:84%
psychology, and their
approach and your work?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Well, it's
based on a medical model.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.540 align:middle line:84%
When I was trained, we called
them "people patients."

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:84%
I call them "clients"
now and "partners."

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And they are partners
in the healing with me.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Then it was about
focusing on the problem,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.670 align:middle line:84%
focusing on their history,
that their history defined

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
the problem that they
were experiencing now.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:90%
And it took a long time.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:84%
Even Jungian, which I was
trained in Jungian psychology,

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.619 align:middle line:90%
was a long-term process.

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And that just did
not suffice for me.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:90%
How

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you work
with the quantum field

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.650 align:middle line:90%
with your clients?

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.810 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: It's kind of
a three-fold process.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I first have to look
at what an individual--

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.210 align:middle line:84%
where they are in
terms of their history

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and what's going on with
them on a physical level.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:84%
They're looking at the
vitamin supplements.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.432 align:middle line:84%
What does their physical
foundation look like first?

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Because we have to
make sure people

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.530 align:middle line:84%
are solid in their
foundation before we

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
can do any kind of
work where you're

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.000 align:middle line:84%
taking somebody out of the body
and then bringing them back in.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And then instead of being
inside the story of your life

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
as a victim, telling someone
to retell their story

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.980 align:middle line:84%
intellectually, which there are
those kind of coachings that

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:84%
do, without first
really being able to go

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.750 align:middle line:84%
into the trauma that created
the story is very important.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So really helping
the individual--

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.430 align:middle line:90%
and if I'm teaching in a class--

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.510 align:middle line:84%
to be able to drop
into their body.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Where is that feeling
that is underneath the--

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.522 align:middle line:90%
because you can tell.

00:18:19.522 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
If it's a physical imbalance
or if it's an emotional,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.960 align:middle line:90%
it's somewhere in the body.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:90%
So we start there.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.000 align:middle line:90%
We go there.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:84%
And I have them
ground you literally

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
going into the root chakra,
grounding their body

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
by moving energy down their
feet into Mother Earth

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.380 align:middle line:90%
so that she's the anchor.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
them go to putting

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.790 align:middle line:84%
a little ball of light
point at the place in which

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:47.170 align:middle line:84%
where the trauma or pain is
and then sending a ray of light

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.130 align:middle line:84%
to a you that exists in
a parallel universe that

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.650 align:middle line:90%
is your full potential self.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.780 align:middle line:84%
And I explain to them
about linear time

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and how it doesn't exist and
how there is a you already

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.660 align:middle line:84%
that knows how to do this
and is whole and healed.

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:06.880 align:middle line:84%
So the W-H-O-L-Y self is
what we're connecting to.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And collapsing time--
and all that means

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
is just have the intention that
you're bringing that self back

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.480 align:middle line:84%
through that ray of light
and into the place where

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.980 align:middle line:90%
the trauma is.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:19.270 align:middle line:90%
And that's where alchemy--

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
that's part of my
Yungian training--

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
is how do you transmute
the trauma-- is

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:90%
through that alchemy.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Giving them the feeling
that they have the ability

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:29.890 align:middle line:90%
to manage this.

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:30.580 align:middle line:90%
I've got this.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:31.420 align:middle line:90%
I have help.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm connecting the higher
self with my personality

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:84%
self with ultimately
this sole purpose.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.333 align:middle line:84%
That's all happening
alchemically here in the core.

00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:42.133 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yes.

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:42.933 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:44.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.140 align:middle line:84%
We have one of Dr.
Toni Galardi's clients

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.720 align:middle line:84%
who has gone through the
LifeQuake process here.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.570 align:middle line:84%
He's here to share his personal
story of embracing change.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, John.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Thank you.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: John, when did you
first meet Dr. Galardi?

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.250 align:middle line:10%
>>JOHN: I met Dr.
Galardi in 2003.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:10%
She was my teacher at school.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I was going back to being a
marriage and family counselor

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.560 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.150 align:middle line:84%
And she was one
of my instructors.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fabulous.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.003 align:middle line:84%
What a good thing that turned
out to be for you, right?

00:20:15.003 --> 00:20:16.420 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Well, as
she said earlier,

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.890 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of divine
intervention.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.710 align:middle line:84%
I think that the divine puts
certain people in front of you

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.248 align:middle line:84%
to help you move along the
path, whether or not you're

00:20:24.248 --> 00:20:25.540 align:middle line:90%
wanting to move along the path.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And she was one of
those people in my life

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.588 align:middle line:84%
that helped me move
along the path.

00:20:28.588 --> 00:20:29.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Realize it or not.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Where were you in your
career at the time?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
What was happening
in your career?

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Well, at that
point in time, for me,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.410 align:middle line:90%
I was a body worker.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.720 align:middle line:84%
So I was a massage
therapist and pursuing

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.600 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of acting here in
Los Angeles, as many of us do.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And I went back to school
to become a marriage family

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.330 align:middle line:84%
counselor because I just
felt like I needed to do more

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
to accomplish
more, always trying

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.810 align:middle line:84%
to feed that little
guy inside that

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.518 align:middle line:84%
just didn't feel like
enough, that I just

00:20:54.518 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:90%
needed to achieve more.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So I had a full
practice of massage.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.520 align:middle line:90%
And clients were coming to me.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And again, it was my
part-time job in order

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.080 align:middle line:90%
to help me be an actor.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And it became an imbalance
beyond my body's means.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I met Toni in school,
trying to achieve a degree

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and become a marriage
family counselor.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And again, she offered me
some tools and a skill set

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.580 align:middle line:90%
to realize that that wasn't me.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't what
I was here to do.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that was the gift of just
meeting her at school that day.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what was it
that didn't feel right?

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.995 align:middle line:84%
What did you feel
needed to change?

00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Can you put your
finger on it now

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.830 align:middle line:84%
in retrospect that might be
of service to our viewers?

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Yeah.

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%
I think there was a
part of me that always

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:84%
felt like I wasn't enough and
that it was the achieving--

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:84%
that I was always taught to
achieve in order to be seen,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to do more, make
money, have a life that

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.200 align:middle line:84%
was revealed to the external
world as full and whole.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think for me,
partially, I was

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.430 align:middle line:84%
trying to be seen for that, not
for my true, authentic self.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And so I just kept
acquiring skills.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I kept going back to school.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I kept trying to go out
into the world of form

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:84%
to collect more placards
to put up on my door.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And I think in every
one of us, there's

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.380 align:middle line:84%
this desire that--
this emptiness

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
that wants to be filled.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we go out into the
world to achieve and to acquire

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
things, avoiding certain things,
and seeking other things.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.470 align:middle line:90%
And in the end of the day--

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.220 align:middle line:84%
and some people at the
end of their life--

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.800 align:middle line:84%
they realize that's not
what they're meant to do.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes indeed.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.830 align:middle line:90%
Toni, what did you see?

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And what did you do for him?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.070 align:middle line:90%
What happened right then?

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So John
came to me as a client

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
after I was no longer working as
an instructor at this college.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:52.420 align:middle line:90%
And he was in burnout.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.560 align:middle line:84%
He didn't know what
he wanted to do next.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And part of my analysis,
looking diagnostically,

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:02.920 align:middle line:84%
is to cast an astrological
chart on an individual.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It shows me where
the soul potential is

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and where the blockages are
for the individual, as well

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.240 align:middle line:90%
as timing for what to do when.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:90%
And I could see--

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.027 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So like where the
blind spots might be?

00:23:15.027 --> 00:23:17.460 align:middle line:84%
You can shed some light on
that, help guide, and bring

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.780 align:middle line:90%
these things to the surface.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Not just blind
spots, but actual blockages

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
in the body that can prevent you
from wanting to make a change.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
And he was in burnout.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't know what
he wanted to do next.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.252 align:middle line:84%
And what I could see was
that he was going to be--

00:23:33.252 --> 00:23:34.710 align:middle line:84%
as I told him, I
think you're going

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:39.650 align:middle line:84%
to be working as a spiritual
teacher internationally.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And what is a blockage?

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So it's an
energy in the body that

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.370 align:middle line:84%
sometimes was
formed in childhood

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:50.010 align:middle line:90%
from a traumatic incident.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Or it can be-- because
in astrology, it's

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:90%
an Eastern-based tradition.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So it can be what's called
[NON-ENGLISH] in the Hindu

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.580 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:05.400 align:middle line:84%
That is a past-life experience
that gets literally imprinted

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.260 align:middle line:84%
into the body into this
lifetime in the unconscious.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And the unconscious
lives in the body.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So Johnny was very successful
and had a lot of celebrities

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.800 align:middle line:90%
who came to him as clients.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And yet he didn't
know what-- he didn't

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:90%
know what he was to do next.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
He knew it needed
to be spiritual.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I could see
that we first had

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:84%
to work with what those
fears were about going out

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.280 align:middle line:84%
into the limelight because
there had been opportunities

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.500 align:middle line:90%
as an actor that he had had--

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.170 align:middle line:84%
being on a soap opera,
different things--

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.360 align:middle line:84%
where he could have gone
big in the limelight.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.980 align:middle line:84%
But I said to him, you are meant
to serve through the light.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So we had to first work
on all of the blockages

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:48.970 align:middle line:84%
around not enough,
the worthiness issues.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I reference that as
a lack of circuitry.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the circuitry
to perceive this deeper truth.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.560 align:middle line:90%
So excellent.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.210 align:middle line:84%
So John, what did
you feel you had

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to let go of or
sever or release,

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.830 align:middle line:84%
cut away from your
operating system as it was?

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: I love how you
say, the lack of circuitry,

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
because for me, I'm
a feeling being.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And so my energy in
my body is electric.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.860 align:middle line:84%
But I could feel in my
body-- my body was giving me

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.790 align:middle line:90%
all the messages.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.530 align:middle line:90%
I just wasn't listening to it.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.710 align:middle line:84%
And the circuitry wasn't
open, and it wasn't flowing.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot
of it was-- and Toni

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:84%
was really great at just
accepting and allowing

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:84%
those disowned
parts of ourselves

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.550 align:middle line:84%
or the shameful
parts of ourselves--

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.720 align:middle line:84%
just to have the light
of awareness on it.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And she was able to guide
me to certain blockages

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.590 align:middle line:84%
that I just assumed were
physiological blockages.

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.980 align:middle line:84%
We tend to get
caught up in like,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.938 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's just a little
tightness or whatever,

00:25:48.938 --> 00:25:51.330 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to really
addressing it and having

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.380 align:middle line:90%
a dialogue with it.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.600 align:middle line:84%
As she would say, go in
with it and be with it

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.310 align:middle line:90%
and welcome those blockages.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.620 align:middle line:84%
But for me, one of
the biggest things

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.860 align:middle line:84%
I feel that shifted
for me was letting

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.320 align:middle line:84%
go of what everybody
in my family

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and around me culturally
thought I needed to be

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and releasing these old,
archetypal beliefs that I just

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.700 align:middle line:84%
felt like I had to
do and to let go

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.426 align:middle line:84%
of that part of myself that
was outlandish, wild, fun,

00:26:23.426 --> 00:26:24.226 align:middle line:90%
spiritual.

00:26:24.226 --> 00:26:26.760 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:84%
To be able to do
what I do now, it's

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:84%
crazy to think of who I was
then, to be quite honest.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.070 align:middle line:84%
To think now that I'm in front
of the room with 60 people

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and helping people wake up and--

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:84%
that just wasn't the John Vosler
that I was when I met her.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.350 align:middle line:84%
So letting go of the
small self but still

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
owning it, letting go
of the "should" monster,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.460 align:middle line:84%
letting go of that not
good enough belief,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.350 align:middle line:84%
but really rewiring
my circuitry--

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:84%
I really like that-- rewiring
my circuitry so that the energy

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:90%
doesn't hurt you.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.290 align:middle line:84%
But the energy can flow through
you in a much more effortless

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.690 align:middle line:84%
way and feel like
grace is guiding

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.090 align:middle line:84%
you as opposed to your
mind and your ego, which

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.507 align:middle line:84%
is only going to tell that
same story over and over again.

00:27:08.507 --> 00:27:09.307 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:27:09.307 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:90%
That's integration.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.660 align:middle line:84%
It's what allows us
to truly have it all.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.770 align:middle line:90%
We are energy beings.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:90%
We are made of this energy.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And we want to celebrate it.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in your discovery of
your own true interconnection

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and that celebration, how
are you expressing that now?

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.090 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned being in the room
teaching 60 people at a time.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.410 align:middle line:90%
What else is happening?

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.120 align:middle line:84%
How else is your
life shining in a way

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:35.110 align:middle line:84%
that was always meant to be but
that you're connected with now?

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: It's great.

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%
It was always meant to be.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.080 align:middle line:84%
I had forgotten
who I really was.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:90%
And so I now remember.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.350 align:middle line:90%
And I teach internationally.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I teach retreats all
around the world.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.087 align:middle line:90%
I teach yoga nidra.

00:27:47.087 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you're
familiar-- but again,

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:90%
a guided meditation.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's a powerful tool.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
most simple tools

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.540 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever come across
that can allow allow anyone

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
to awaken, to remember
their true nature.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.310 align:middle line:90%
And so I teach at Esalen, Omega.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:84%
In Kripalu, we just did the
first International Yoga Nidra

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Conference that I worked
with Richard Miller on.

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.240 align:middle line:84%
So my life is actually
living me as opposed to how

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:90%
I was living before.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
beautiful experience

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
to be able to be in the
transformational business.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, I give kudos
to Toni in the beginning

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.310 align:middle line:84%
because she sort of saw all
that in some way that she does.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And she just kept
helping me welcome

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:35.660 align:middle line:84%
what it was I was resisting and
suppressing and welcome that.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:84%
And that energy of
welcoming is what

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I think gave me this
blast-off, this experience of,

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.310 align:middle line:90%
all I got to do is be me.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.540 align:middle line:84%
That's all that's asked
of me-- is just be me.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And the divine will
take care of it.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You are original
medicine, right?

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.987 align:middle line:90%
>>JOHN: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:49.987 --> 00:28:52.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And as we express as
such, we serve the tribe.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:57.020 align:middle line:84%
So what do you tell
your clients about Toni?

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Well, I sent
her a lot of people.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: He has.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: So being that I didn't
become a marriage family

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.640 align:middle line:90%
counselor-- thank you, Lord--

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I then realized the
best opportunity

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I could is to send all
my clients to Toni.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:13.460 align:middle line:84%
And the people that really, I
think, benefit most from her

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.530 align:middle line:90%
are people that are stuck.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're not willing to look
at boredom as an opportunity.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.590 align:middle line:84%
They're not able to
look at what they know

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.560 align:middle line:90%
as a place of transformation.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I send a lot
of people to her.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And the majority of
the people that I--

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.050 align:middle line:84%
most everyone that
I've ever sent to her

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
comes back like, why are
you keeping her from me?

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.400 align:middle line:84%
She's a secret no
one knows about.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, you wait.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's going to know
about Dr. Galardi really soon.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of transformation
happens with my clients

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.180 align:middle line:90%
when I send them to Toni.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.440 align:middle line:90%
And I will continue to do so.

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:90%
I still go to her.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:54.020 align:middle line:84%
There are moments for me where
I can feel a transformation

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:54.890 align:middle line:90%
happening.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Something's not
landing or integrating.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:90%
I call her up.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:90%
I need a session.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's reconnect.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.950 align:middle line:84%
As you would say, my circuitry
feels a little bit off.

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:05.300 align:middle line:90%
Something doesn't feel right.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.640 align:middle line:84%
And she can help
in so many ways.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for sharing you

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.450 align:middle line:84%
with us today, John, and for
being with us on the "Healing

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:15.413 align:middle line:90%
Matrix."

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
>>JOHN: Thank you so
much for your time.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:17.882 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:30:17.882 --> 00:30:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Bye-bye.

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.780 align:middle line:10%
>>GALARDI: There
is a piece that is

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.870 align:middle line:10%
really important to this
whole LifeQuake journey

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:28.260 align:middle line:10%
that Johnny went through after
we did this processing, which

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:10%
is the apprentice stage.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And it's that willingness that
if you do leave behind the work

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:34.800 align:middle line:90%
you were doing--

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.440 align:middle line:84%
the willingness to
trial and error.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And so he became an apprentice
to a spiritual teacher who

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.750 align:middle line:84%
has-- one of the lineages
that he does is yoga nidra.

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.990 align:middle line:10%
And so John was willing to go
from being this lucrative--

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.770 align:middle line:10%
having this lucrative
practice to humbly

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:57.630 align:middle line:10%
serving a spiritual teacher
and starting from the bottom.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's part of the
courageous journey--

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:05.070 align:middle line:84%
is to be willing to be in
a beginner's mind again

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.920 align:middle line:84%
and potentially start
something from the ground up.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:14.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this is part of your
seven-step series of processes

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.780 align:middle line:90%
that you have developed.

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a little bit
with us about this these seven

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.700 align:middle line:84%
stages of the LifeQuake
Repurposing Project, this model

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.830 align:middle line:90%
that you have developed?

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:25.860 align:middle line:90%
Lay it out for us.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.132 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: OK.

00:31:27.132 --> 00:31:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So there is a conscious and
an unconscious way people

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.950 align:middle line:84%
go through this, at least
the first four stages.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And the first stage,
as we shared earlier,

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.340 align:middle line:90%
is the boredom stage.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody comes to
me in the boredom stage,

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I start to have them
pay attention to,

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.120 align:middle line:84%
what is it that
attracts you now?

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.090 align:middle line:84%
Because people will
often say, nothing.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I just don't find anything
in my life very interesting.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I just nudge them
to pay attention to,

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.530 align:middle line:90%
where does your energy go up--

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.430 align:middle line:84%
just noticing, where
does your energy go up?

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:55.980 align:middle line:90%
So that's the first stage--

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:59.010 align:middle line:84%
is connecting the dots to
where your energy goes up.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.920 align:middle line:84%
The second stage, if
done unconsciously,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.050 align:middle line:90%
is when you go into depression.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:08.640 align:middle line:84%
If consciously done, you
begin to consciously die

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.220 align:middle line:84%
to parts of your
life and beliefs

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.610 align:middle line:84%
that are no longer
serving you in preparation

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:18.240 align:middle line:84%
for stage three, which is
the radical severance stage.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, if someone does
it unconsciously,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:21.840 align:middle line:90%
they hit the wall.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like you get the
tap on the shoulder.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Then you get the two-by-four.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Then you get the Mack truck.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:90%
I got the Mack truck.

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: These are
the auto accidents.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yeah.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I call myself the
recovering poster

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.590 align:middle line:90%
child for the change-impaired.

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You were not
interested in change.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And so life showed
you how to do that.

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:43.410 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Yes, because I
also came from a family--

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:47.400 align:middle line:84%
my father by day was
a engineer and felt

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.850 align:middle line:84%
that he had to have a paycheck
and benefits and a pension.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And at night, he was gambling.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.960 align:middle line:84%
That was how he got
his dopamine fix.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.160 align:middle line:90%
And so I saw that.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.990 align:middle line:90%
My mother was his codependent.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:02.980 align:middle line:84%
So I saw that model for
what happens, what you--

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:08.500 align:middle line:84%
the cost that you pay when you
try to stay in false security,

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.300 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.842 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this
gambling at night even

00:33:10.842 --> 00:33:12.750 align:middle line:84%
though he was
working stringently

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:84%
to keep that paycheck--
and then this

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.700 align:middle line:84%
is part of
addictive-type behaviors

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that we slide into as a means
of compensating for this pain.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:27.060 align:middle line:84%
How can you speak into
it regarding your model?

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: If there has been an
onset of addictive behavior--

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and that addictive
behavior isn't always

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.390 align:middle line:84%
just substance abuse or
gambling, something as extreme

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.190 align:middle line:90%
as that.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:41.970 align:middle line:84%
It can be excessive social
media as a distraction

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:90%
from feeling your feelings.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.100 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
ways in which--

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:52.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Or eating or
shopping or exercising.

00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:55.440 align:middle line:84%
People can even
addict their ways

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.260 align:middle line:84%
into things that seem to
be socially acceptable.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:84%
But unknowingly, they're
still caught in this stream

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.860 align:middle line:90%
that you're referencing.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.110 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: And that's one
of the things I talk about--

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.330 align:middle line:90%
is that in the exer--

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.630 align:middle line:84%
what is going to be appropriate
during different stages

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.840 align:middle line:84%
of this model just in terms
of your exercise and diet

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.010 align:middle line:90%
can change.

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.710 align:middle line:90%
You can actually need something.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.520 align:middle line:84%
You may need serotonin-rich
food when you're in stage three,

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.719 align:middle line:84%
when you're literally
on fire in fear

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:84%
if you've just had a
massive crisis hit you.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to be eating
foods that really support

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.500 align:middle line:84%
neurotransmitters and
exercise that supports--

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.760 align:middle line:84%
like yoga nidra instead
of, perhaps, running--

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.219 align:middle line:84%
so adjusting based
on where you are.

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
have these, what

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.080 align:middle line:90%
is appropriate to this stage?

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And then after the
radical severance stage

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:52.110 align:middle line:84%
is the stage four, which is
after you have left behind

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:53.620 align:middle line:90%
or it's been left--

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.020 align:middle line:90%
you've been left behind.

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.060 align:middle line:90%
And you're in that transition.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So often the things that I see
when people talk about creating

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.640 align:middle line:90%
from the quantum is--

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.540 align:middle line:84%
before you can create the
new reality in the quantum,

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.140 align:middle line:84%
it's important to really sit
with what I call the "cellar

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.650 align:middle line:84%
self," which is there are
these subpersonalities

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.440 align:middle line:84%
that you've been
suppressing or repressing

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:84%
in the cellar of
your consciousness

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.800 align:middle line:84%
that need to be brought
out and integrated.

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And so that stage four is
about being willing to not

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.590 align:middle line:90%
run into the next.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's redesign the life.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Let's create the new identity.

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.150 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's sit with what is
really needing to emerge

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.180 align:middle line:90%
in a slow, maybe a little bit--

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.860 align:middle line:90%
a timely process.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.740 align:middle line:84%
And then toward the
end of that stage,

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the soul will start
to give you dreams.

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I have my clients
keep a dream journal--

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:49.530 align:middle line:84%
divine coincidences
that are guiding you

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:53.280 align:middle line:84%
towards stage five, which is
the apprentice, trial-and-error

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.990 align:middle line:84%
stage of creating a new
soul-purposed vocation.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And then stage six-- so that's
the trial-and-error stage.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Stage six is what I call
the "fertile spirit stage"--

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:09.000 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you look at your
life now from the place of,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.590 align:middle line:84%
everything is always
working for me?

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.660 align:middle line:90%
I am in abundance.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:16.500 align:middle line:84%
How do I create abundance
from a new purview?

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then out of that really
mastering change and developing

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.180 align:middle line:84%
your sole purpose, stage
seven is my favorite stage--

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.640 align:middle line:84%
is about becoming an agent
of change in the world.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What can you
say about your crisis

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:34.640 align:middle line:84%
period, where these accidents
were happening, et cetera?

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.020 align:middle line:84%
This is around stage
three-ish for you.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when you moved to
stage four, was it over?

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:90%
And then to stage five--

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.000 align:middle line:90%
here I am-- and stage six.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Just speak to people about
authentic integration

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.700 align:middle line:84%
in our own soul's
evolution so that we don't

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:90%
try to skip to the finish line.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Thank you
for that question

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.790 align:middle line:90%
because it isn't a linear.

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Just like we aren't really
living in linear time,

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:03.290 align:middle line:90%
it isn't a linear model.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:06.530 align:middle line:84%
You can find yourself
jumping back and forth.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are tools that
can help with the mastery.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just meant
to be-- because I

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.890 align:middle line:84%
have building elements to
master in each stage to help.

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:19.280 align:middle line:84%
When you have a tool box
so that you get snagged

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and you go back into-- like the
third near-fatal experience I

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:84%
had, which was my
environmental poisoning,

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I had already written this
whole model, was teaching.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.530 align:middle line:84%
One of the clips you have is
of me teaching in that suit.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:84%
I was living in a motel, having
just been told by a doctor,

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.400 align:middle line:90%
we don't know how to treat this.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It's tied to 20 different
kinds of cancers.

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.560 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go on the path
of the wounded healer, which

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:84%
is, they don't have
the answers for you.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.940 align:middle line:84%
You have to find
your own answers.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And I really literally
pulled together a protocol

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.160 align:middle line:84%
with the help of
a holistic doctor

00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to heal my body
from a neurotoxin.

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So let's
speak to the question

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.400 align:middle line:84%
that I know is
brewing out there.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.070 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to go through a
crisis in order to quake?

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Do I have to be in pain
in order to awaken?

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I think it has
to do with the degree.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I think that all human beings
feel a little resistance

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.720 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
having to change up

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.360 align:middle line:84%
their lives because
in the Western world,

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.290 align:middle line:90%
we associate change with loss.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.500 align:middle line:84%
But for the type
of individual who

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:39.920 align:middle line:84%
is highly intuitive, connected
to their body, and can see,

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:45.360 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm entering the
fall, autumn season of my life.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.050 align:middle line:84%
This is no longer
working for me, yes.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:49.970 align:middle line:84%
You do not have to
go hit the wall.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.950 align:middle line:84%
You do not have
to have a crisis.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:55.070 align:middle line:84%
So inside, I don't think
of crisis the same way

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.540 align:middle line:90%
that I used to anymore.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.280 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean having
to hit the wall.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.960 align:middle line:90%
It means emergence, awakening.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And that
pain is inevitable,

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.220 align:middle line:90%
but suffering is optional.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.230 align:middle line:90%
We are at choice.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think you're really
speaking about surrender.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Can we surrender
to the grace that's

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:84%
trying to happen through
our life experience

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.187 align:middle line:84%
and make it be a wave of grace
that is carrying our life?

00:39:21.187 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:84%
Or do we fight it and think
that there's something

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.950 align:middle line:90%
bad on the other side?

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're
miserable, we're

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.680 align:middle line:90%
familiar with what's going on.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.150 align:middle line:90%
So we resist that change.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, you spoke
about stage seven.

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And can you just now--

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.117 align:middle line:84%
let's allow you to speak a
little bit more about that.

00:39:38.117 --> 00:39:39.200 align:middle line:90%
It was your favorite part.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.600 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to cut that short.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So my
motto is, when you

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:49.280 align:middle line:84%
access, activate, and
actuate your soul purpose,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:90%
you change the world.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't
necessarily mean you

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:57.110 align:middle line:84%
have to be some big social
activist in the world.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:58.340 align:middle line:90%
It's, do you recycle?

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Are you doing the
work on yourself

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:05.930 align:middle line:90%
to integrate your shadow?

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Are you coming from
an authentic self?

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And are you being kind and
doing service for others

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.280 align:middle line:90%
just in your community?

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.820 align:middle line:84%
But it is about that
really, for the world

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:20.360 align:middle line:84%
to change, for us to have this
paradigm shift, we can't blame.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.250 align:middle line:84%
We can't look out
there and go, oh,

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.960 align:middle line:90%
the corporations are corrupt.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.140 align:middle line:90%
The government is corrupt.

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.940 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.530 align:middle line:90%
We change, the world changes.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Gandhi said it first.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Absolutely.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And the shadow self is
just the parts of us

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.908 align:middle line:84%
that we've not yet shown the
light of our own consciousness

00:40:34.908 --> 00:40:35.708 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:40:35.708 --> 00:40:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And then it's actually
contributing to our greatness

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.710 align:middle line:84%
if we allow it to instead
of running from it.

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.070 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Absolutely.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.250 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you referenced
Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara was
a friend of mine.

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And we cotaught in
some settings together.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.996 align:middle line:84%
And how much of an
influence of her work

00:40:53.996 --> 00:40:58.092 align:middle line:84%
is in your understanding of
what you're sharing today?

00:40:58.092 --> 00:41:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: I owe a lot
to Barbara Marx Hubbard.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.360 align:middle line:90%
She was my first mentor.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And when these visions
were coming through me,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:07.790 align:middle line:84%
she was actually
staying with me.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.950 align:middle line:90%
I was in my late 20s.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.360 align:middle line:90%
And I was sharing a house.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I left everything behind at
that point in Orange County.

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:16.560 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't know what was next.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.793 align:middle line:84%
And she was sharing this
concept of conscious evolution.

00:41:19.793 --> 00:41:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And there was this thing
called the "internet"

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:22.510 align:middle line:90%
that was beginning.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And she saw this as the
nervous system of the planet

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.650 align:middle line:90%
birthing itself.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And so when I started having
visions of Mother Earth

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.312 align:middle line:84%
speaking to me, I had that
background from Barbara.

00:41:38.312 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And she became the
first guest when

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.170 align:middle line:90%
I did my talk show, actually.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.678 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:41:43.678 --> 00:41:46.220 align:middle line:84%
We're developing on the outside
what's going on in the inside

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.510 align:middle line:84%
so that we can see it,
so that we can master it.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And this reference of
the global nervous system

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.440 align:middle line:84%
makes perfect sense as
a communication system

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.000 align:middle line:90%
for unity consciousness.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, unity consciousness
is something

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.600 align:middle line:90%
that people are speaking about.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's become a thing
that we're interested in.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And we mentioned earlier
today about times of change

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:11.750 align:middle line:84%
or times of opportunity for
our own soulful evolution.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Why is what you're sharing
today so important at this time?

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.393 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: Because
we need a reframe.

00:42:19.393 --> 00:42:20.435 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: We need a reframe.

00:42:20.435 --> 00:42:21.235 align:middle line:90%
>>GALARDI: Yes.

00:42:21.235 --> 00:42:23.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Can you say more?

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: There is a
whole media conversation

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and social media conversation
that the world is

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.310 align:middle line:90%
going to hell in a handbasket.

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have much time
on the planet and all of that.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.160 align:middle line:90%
And addiction's rising.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.010 align:middle line:84%
We're about to have a
recession, all of that stuff.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And I believe we need a model
and a philosophy and a guide,

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:49.400 align:middle line:84%
a roadmap, which
is what this is,

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.330 align:middle line:84%
for being able to
see this as a rebirth

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.780 align:middle line:84%
that we are each individually
and collectively birthing

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.600 align:middle line:84%
into the next level
of our evolution.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.280 align:middle line:10%
But I also think
it's important--

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:03.530 align:middle line:10%
this is really important to me--

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.010 align:middle line:10%
that people understand that
there are body things going

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.380 align:middle line:10%
on that are the shadow side--

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:12.960 align:middle line:10%
the rise of viruses, Kundalini
complex, which I went through.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.740 align:middle line:84%
I was in bed for 18 months
after my Kundalini awakening

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.960 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't have
the tools for being

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.830 align:middle line:84%
able to slowly allow for
that awakening to take place.

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.230 align:middle line:84%
So the endocrine system
and the chakra system

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.510 align:middle line:84%
together because
they're so connected--

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:32.332 align:middle line:84%
there was an overload in the
electrical system of my body.

00:43:32.332 --> 00:43:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And it literally
left me bedridden.

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So most people,
having looking like I

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.790 align:middle line:84%
was having epileptic seizures,
would have thought, oh my god.

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.700 align:middle line:90%
This is epilepsy.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And I did get checked
out by a neurologist.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And I was told I have a
bulging disc in my neck

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:50.740 align:middle line:90%
from the car accidents.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.510 align:middle line:84%
So the energy was coming
through, blocking.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And it was lurching me forward.

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, trying
to break through.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GALARDI: So that
can happen to anyone.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.443 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have to be
careful about doing Kundalini

00:44:02.443 --> 00:44:03.610 align:middle line:90%
yoga and some of the things.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I love the yoga that you're
using, that you're teaching

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.305 align:middle line:90%
and have codified.

00:44:08.305 --> 00:44:10.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The body
awake yoga to build

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:13.150 align:middle line:84%
the circuitry for this
energy to traverse up

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.150 align:middle line:84%
through the primitive brain into
our high-brain creative service

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.730 align:middle line:84%
centers instead of
just trying to survive.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.140 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Where can people learn more?

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:26.164 align:middle line:10%
>>GALARDI: They can go to my
website, drtonigalardi.com.

00:44:26.164 --> 00:44:28.330 align:middle line:10%
What I've provided is--

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.870 align:middle line:10%
for the person who can't work
with me in a coaching capacity,

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:33.160 align:middle line:10%
there's--

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.710 align:middle line:10%
or in my Zoom classes.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.160 align:middle line:84%
I want to give people as much
free information as they can.

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's blogs
on things to do.

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:45.360 align:middle line:84%
There are videos
and my newsletter.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I do a newsletter called
Astrology Tips for Your Career

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Work Week.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And so anybody can sign up
for that and get it free.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:54.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:59.080 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much, Dr. Galardi,
for telling your story with us

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:84%
today and for the wonderful work
that you're doing in the world.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.950 align:middle line:90%
It's very important.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.800 align:middle line:10%
You don't need to suffer
and experience disaster

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:10%
to initiate change
in your own life.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.780 align:middle line:10%
With Dr. Galardi's
LifeQuake phenomenon,

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.600 align:middle line:10%
you can learn to move
forward with a greater ease

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:19.830 align:middle line:10%
into your life's purpose and
possibly prevent devastation

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.930 align:middle line:10%
or a major life disaster.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:24.000 align:middle line:84%
With these tools, we
can look differently

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.480 align:middle line:84%
at depression, despair,
addiction, and crisis

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:84%
and embrace change
without resistance,

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.590 align:middle line:90%
but with resilience.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:33.600 align:middle line:90%
