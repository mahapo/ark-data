>>REGINA MEREDITH: When it
comes to health and fitness,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.790 align:middle line:84%
it seems like we're all
looking for that magic bullet.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:84%
While it's unlikely there is
one universal solution for all

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.780 align:middle line:84%
of us, the world of technology
is bringing some devices

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that nearly are a magic bullet.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.900 align:middle line:10%
One such device was brought to
my attention through a friend.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.282 align:middle line:10%
After following up on
the story a little bit,

00:00:52.282 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:10%
I think we may have
found something

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:10%
that might benefit
most if not all of us.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ian Gainor is with us to
tell us all about the device.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, what's
the name of it?

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.489 align:middle line:84%
>>IAN GAINOR: The ZAAZ
Whole Body Vibration unit.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whole
Body Vibration unit,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to be
showing demonstrations

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.470 align:middle line:84%
in just a little bit
and see how it works,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.379 align:middle line:84%
but before any of
that, I really thought

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:14.920 align:middle line:84%
it would be nice to get to know
you a little bit so they know

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
why you're here, and we're
talking to you specifically

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.080 align:middle line:84%
because you have
quite a rich history

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
in the field of
chiropractic, but far

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.510 align:middle line:84%
beyond the borders
of just chiropractic.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.135 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about yourself.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.760 align:middle line:10%
>>GAINOR: OK My dad was
in the Canadian Army

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.366 align:middle line:10%
in the second war,
and he was injured.

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:10%
He was paralyzed,
and there was nothing

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.630 align:middle line:10%
the medical community
could do for him.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:10%
Someone suggested that
he see a chiropractor.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.480 align:middle line:90%
He said, "What can they do?"

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.760 align:middle line:90%
They said, "I don't know."

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:90%
He went to see the chiropractor.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.520 align:middle line:84%
He started getting results
in the second visit.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.920 align:middle line:84%
The feeling started come back
on his-- left side of his body

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.567 align:middle line:90%
was paralyzed.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:50.900 align:middle line:90%
The feeling started coming back.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.650 align:middle line:90%
He got excited.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
He says, I want to
do this for others.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.210 align:middle line:84%
I went to chiropractic
college with my dad

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
when I was a little
boy, and he took mom

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and I and we went
to Davenport, Iowa

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.240 align:middle line:84%
and went to
chiropractic college.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I was injured while I was there.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:90%
I was in a car accident.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.690 align:middle line:90%
My back was injured.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.410 align:middle line:84%
That went to a chronic
weakness in my low back.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.050 align:middle line:84%
The chiropractor could
keep it under control.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But the reason I
bring those in is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.060 align:middle line:84%
to tell you that I look
at things differently

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:90%
as the chiropractor.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
I look at things differently
than the medical community

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.230 align:middle line:90%
does.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.327 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to ask
you a question now.

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:30.261 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: M-hm.

00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: M-hm.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What is that?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: This is my model.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.840 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession
has different specialties.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.820 align:middle line:84%
They've got orthopedic surgeons,
mainstream OR, gynecologist.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.110 align:middle line:90%
They've got-- you tell me three.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Ophthalmology.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.235 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Ophthalmologists.

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:90%
They look at the eyes.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.730 align:middle line:90%
Heart specialist.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.339 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:10%
Oncologists--

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.690 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Oncology.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:10%
>>GAINOR: --just study cancer.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The orthopedic surgeons
just do joints.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:84%
There's podiatrists
that just do feet.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.217 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:84%
They look at those areas of the
body, they specialize in that,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and they're really
good at what they do.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.910 align:middle line:84%
In the holistic profession,
chiropractors, acupuncturists,

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.637 align:middle line:84%
naturopaths, herbalists,
nutritionists,

00:03:19.637 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:90%
they look at things differently.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.825 align:middle line:84%
They look at how the body
fits together and works--

00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:24.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Whoa.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.820 align:middle line:90%
That's very cool.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.687 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --and works
as a whole together.

00:03:27.687 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nice prop.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.290 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.070 align:middle line:84%
So they look at
things differently.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.360 align:middle line:84%
So the fitness
community is somewhat

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.940 align:middle line:90%
like the medical community.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.460 align:middle line:84%
The yoga specializes
in flexibility,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
and the weights specialize
in toning or shaping

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.800 align:middle line:90%
certain parts.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.799 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Building mass.

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Building mass.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.350 align:middle line:84%
The runners, they all specialize
differently, and what I found

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:84%
is the Whole Body
Vibration unit that ZAAZ

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
brings to market
affects the whole body

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and how it all fits
and works together.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's critical
to your introduction

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
where you talked about--
can it help everybody?

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I'm looking at it

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
from the holistic perspective
of how the body works

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
and seeing benefits for
children, benefits for fitness.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:90%
We'll do a demo with some--

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fit people.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: The
young and the buff.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:90%
We'll do that.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I see benefits
for Granny Goose,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.380 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see
because of the way

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.370 align:middle line:84%
you can control the intensity
by putting your feet together

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and apart, if you can walk,
you can get on this machine.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't go into
the named condition

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:90%
that some people ask me about.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, what about
this, or what about that?

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.874 align:middle line:84%
And I go I don't know
about those things.

00:04:49.874 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, you
didn't know about it

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.206 align:middle line:84%
when you started with
this thing either.

00:04:53.206 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And so your background,
you studied a lot

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.950 align:middle line:84%
of different modalities
beyond just chiropractic,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
really looking at the holistic
kind of footprint of health.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.285 align:middle line:90%
You went into kinesiology--

00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:05.201 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Naturopathy.

00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:07.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --naturopathy,
many, many other modalities.

00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
You studied a lot of
things besides chiropractic

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:90%
for really a life-long passion.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Life long.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Life long passion.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: And it's a lot of fun.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.450 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, and it is.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.070 align:middle line:84%
And also I know from
talking with you previously,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.800 align:middle line:84%
your main thing is
you really don't

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.310 align:middle line:90%
like seeing people suffer.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
You're truly a-- I
won't say a healer,

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
but a facilitator with
a compassionate heart.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.030 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me that's
what's driving you.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted to
say that because I'm

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:84%
very impressed with
that trait in you.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.915 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Thank you.

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.498 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But how
did you specifically

00:05:34.498 --> 00:05:35.772 align:middle line:90%
become aware of this?

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:36.355 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:05:36.355 --> 00:05:37.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Let me--

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.585 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: go to that.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.735 align:middle line:84%
You talked about
the word "healer".

00:05:40.735 --> 00:05:41.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:41.465 --> 00:05:45.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: When I went
to chiropractic college,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
I wanted to do,

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
but I went to
chiropractic college,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and the philosophy
instructor was as boring

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:84%
as the instructor in
"Ferris Bueller's Day Off."

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I think most people
that saw it can relate.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: They can.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.741 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:02.170 align:middle line:84%
This guy was really bad,
and one day-- and it

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
was early, early
semester, first year, he

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.560 align:middle line:84%
says let me tell
you how this works.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.310 align:middle line:90%
Let me paint the big picture.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:84%
And he says now-- and I can't
say it as boring as him.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.410 align:middle line:84%
He says when the egg
and sperm got together

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.690 align:middle line:84%
in your mother's womb,
your intelligence

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
took over and formed your
body according to God's plan.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.800 align:middle line:90%
And I went, whoa.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.710 align:middle line:90%
He's got my attention.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And then he says, if you
have the intelligence

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
to form that body, you
have the intelligence

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.390 align:middle line:84%
to heal it as long as the
intelligence can communicate

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.000 align:middle line:84%
with the body and the body
with the intelligence.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:90%
Then you heal it yourself.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.960 align:middle line:84%
As chiropractors, we work
on the nervous system

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.446 align:middle line:90%
to facilitate that process.

00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: M-hm.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Well all of the
other holistic modalities

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
that I mentioned or professions
that I mentioned, basically,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:90%
that's what their philosophy is.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I found that this
compliments that.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It facilitates how
the intelligence

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:90%
communicates with the body.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's best demonstrated with
Geriatric Joe who has trouble,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
he struggles to get
out of his chair.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.371 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh, and I want to get
to an anecdote about that you

00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:20.920 align:middle line:84%
just shared with me off camera
that was amazing in a bit.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.336 align:middle line:84%
But continue on what you were
saying before we do that.

00:07:23.336 --> 00:07:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: But Geriatric
Joe has trouble getting out

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.870 align:middle line:84%
of his chair, and he
shuffles his feet.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:84%
The reason he
shuffles his feet is

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.520 align:middle line:84%
because he doesn't
have the balance

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:84%
to pick up his back foot
and set it down here.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.090 align:middle line:84%
He's going to topple
in that amount of time.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he graduates
from the shuffle, to the cane,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:84%
to the walker, to the chair
as things deteriorate.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.780 align:middle line:84%
The oscillation
process on this resets

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.360 align:middle line:84%
the neurological
circuits from the feet

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:84%
to the brain, the occipital
lobe, the back of the brain.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.420 align:middle line:84%
It resets those
circuits and reminds

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.840 align:middle line:84%
all of the components
along the way:

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
this is what we're supposed
to do to keep her balance.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I've put hundreds of
people on with balance issues

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and seen a measurable
improvement

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.700 align:middle line:84%
in two or three minutes
99% of the time.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK now--

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: That's exciting.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.190 align:middle line:84%
It is exciting, and there
are many other things

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.070 align:middle line:90%
you're using it for.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.430 align:middle line:84%
I want to go back now to
when you first found out

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
about it, because it's
an interesting story,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.437 align:middle line:84%
and some of the people you
put on it-- and you said,

00:08:31.437 --> 00:08:32.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it does.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Just get on it and try it.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So how did you first
come in contact with it

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.429 align:middle line:84%
and come to appreciate
its benefits?

00:08:38.429 --> 00:08:41.139 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I had a sprained ankle
from basketball at college.

00:08:41.139 --> 00:08:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of years later-- I can't
count that high-- it went out

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.630 align:middle line:84%
on me, but the chiropractor
always dealt with it.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.860 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I went out, the
chiropractor dealt with it.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Well this time, the
chiropractor wasn't helping.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I was hobbling into
his house to see him.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.480 align:middle line:84%
His wife said, "Ian, come
and get on my machine."

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:90%
I said, "I'm really busy."

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:90%
She said, "Shut up.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Get on the machine."

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Yes dear."

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.730 align:middle line:90%
I've been trained.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:07.677 align:middle line:90%
I got on the machine.

00:09:07.677 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, "What does it do?"

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:90%
She says, "I don't know.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.947 align:middle line:90%
It helps people."

00:09:10.947 --> 00:09:12.863 align:middle line:84%
I stood there for 10
minutes talking with her.

00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:14.030 align:middle line:90%
I got off the machine.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:90%
The swelling was gone.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
The pain was gone and
mobility was restored.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.624 align:middle line:84%
I said I'll take it
and took it home.

00:09:20.624 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:90%
My wife said, "What's that?"

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:90%
I said, "It's an ankle machine."

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.864 align:middle line:90%
She said, "OK."

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Blind
leading the blind.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.155 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Well, yeah.

00:09:27.155 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I did not see any
other benefits for it,

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.020 align:middle line:84%
because I read a
brochure, and I looked

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.931 align:middle line:90%
at those claims that are--

00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.701 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Some of
these-- yeah right.

00:09:35.701 --> 00:09:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, I may have used a little
more colorful term than that,

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:90%
but we get the idea.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.827 align:middle line:84%
And then as patients were
coming in, I would say,

00:09:45.827 --> 00:09:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I've got this new machine.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:47.826 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to try it?

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had a 75-year-old guy
who couldn't stand up straight.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.760 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't help him.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.264 align:middle line:90%
I fired him as a patient.

00:09:54.264 --> 00:09:55.180 align:middle line:90%
He got on the machine.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.430 align:middle line:84%
He stood up straight in two
minutes for the first time

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:90%
in 15 years.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.040 align:middle line:90%
And I went, holy cow.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that good.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So he bought the machine
and started using it.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.875 align:middle line:84%
I continued to work with him,
and between the two of us,

00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:10.405 align:middle line:84%
we got him-- he had to learn
how to walk all over again.

00:10:10.405 --> 00:10:12.613 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because it had
been how many years since he

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:12.880 align:middle line:90%
had walked?

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: 15 years.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.291 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 15 years.

00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Since
he'd walked upright.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.670 align:middle line:90%
He was antalgic.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.206 align:middle line:84%
His body bent over
about like that.

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
was pretty profound.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: That was profound.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:84%
His wife didn't think she
needed it, but she got on it.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.560 align:middle line:84%
She was a rubenesque
75-year-old,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and she came to me four months
later and she goes, "Doc.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.260 align:middle line:90%
Doc."

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
He was on the table,
and she goes, "Doc."

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.850 align:middle line:84%
She stands up and goes, "I lost
three dress sizes on my waist."

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: From that?

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.990 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: From that.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:46.794 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because she
was totally sedentary

00:10:46.794 --> 00:10:47.710 align:middle line:90%
other than doing that?

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Other than doing that.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Did she go on a diet
at the same time?

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Nope.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:90%
Just that.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And then she says, about a
month later, she goes, "Doc.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:90%
Doc.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I lost my turkey waddle."

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing like
vanity to motivate a person.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Well, she
was 75, but how do you

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:90%
lose your turkey waddle?

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.930 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm going--

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Usually, you
go under the knife.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.160 align:middle line:90%
I suppose.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.015 align:middle line:90%
Well--

00:11:13.015 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.016 align:middle line:90%
Not pleasant, huh?

00:11:15.016 --> 00:11:15.422 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Not pleasant.

00:11:15.422 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:90%
So all right.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.345 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have a lot of
these kinds of stories.

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.595 align:middle line:90%
We have some wonderful demos--

00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:20.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: We do.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.401 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --that we have already
taped just a few minutes ago

00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:24.980 align:middle line:90%
so you can see how this works.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to do is
get into the technology

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
itself for a little bit,
the roots of it going back

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.240 align:middle line:84%
into Russia, NASA, and so forth,
and bring us forward on that.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Back in the
'60s, space program.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Russia and America were
competing with one another.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little Canadian
boy watching this race,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:90%
and it was quite interesting.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.426 align:middle line:84%
But the Russians were up
in space for like 400 days

00:11:48.426 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:84%
and the Americans were
only in space for 90.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:84%
That was as long
as they could go.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And I saw pictures of them
carrying the astronauts

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:84%
or cosmonauts, I don't
which, out of the capsules.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:10%
But the Russians
developed this technology

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:10%
to build up bone
density and muscle

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.720 align:middle line:10%
mass because that's
what they lost in space.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:10%
Hm.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:10%
That's what Geriatric Joe loses
in his easy chair in today's

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:10%
society, so they
built 'em up for that.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.030 align:middle line:84%
But the Russians were
leading in that space race.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sitting there,
and I may have been young,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:84%
but I knew those damn
Russians were cheating.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.135 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:22.135 --> 00:12:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: And this is
what they were doing.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.300 align:middle line:84%
The iron wall came
down in '89, '90.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:90%
Iron curtain.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And about '95, NASA got
ahold of the technology,

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.401 align:middle line:84%
and it started making
inroads into Western society.

00:12:40.401 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's different
models that have come out.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.566 align:middle line:84%
There's three different
kinds of technology with it.

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, didn't it go
into the athletic industry

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.490 align:middle line:90%
also in Russia?

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I read somewhere the
prima ballerinas were using it.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.342 align:middle line:84%
They were using it for the
top performers in the Bolshoi

00:12:56.342 --> 00:12:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and other ballets, companies.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.216 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Right.

00:12:58.216 --> 00:13:00.835 align:middle line:84%
They took it through the space
program to the sports program.

00:13:00.835 --> 00:13:01.381 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:02.755 align:middle line:84%
And what were they
finding by way

00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:84%
of results in
sports at that time?

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: They were
doing very well.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.280 align:middle line:90%
They were winning gold medals.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.416 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:13:08.416 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:90%
I remember.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Yeah.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: M-hm.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.345 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Annoying isn't it?

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so
this was commonly

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.605 align:middle line:90%
used in their training.

00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: In Eastern Europe--

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.872 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Eastern
Europe and Russia?

00:13:17.872 --> 00:13:18.830 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: --and Russia.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:19.360 align:middle line:90%
That was.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It was just part
of their program.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:90%
They saw the benefits for it.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
came over here as,

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.920 align:middle line:84%
the benefits for fitness,
the fitness industry.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And the golf
industry has used it.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:90%
Football has used it.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.980 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what other sports
programs-- some of the colleges

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:45.980 align:middle line:84%
are using it for their athletes
for different applications.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But as you'll see in the
demo, the fitness guy

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.970 align:middle line:84%
can see that,
right away, that it

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
complement whatever he's doing.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:57.240 align:middle line:84%
He can keep doing it, but
it'll make him better.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now, when you're
looking at it from a fitness

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.414 align:middle line:84%
point of view and that
is, in fact, in a moment,

00:14:02.414 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go
to that where we

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
had one of our fellow
employees here,

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Brock, who works out
almost every day.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Every day.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.068 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just about every day
for an hour, hour and a half

00:14:12.068 --> 00:14:12.580 align:middle line:90%
even.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.310 align:middle line:90%
And so he's obviously very fit.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.680 align:middle line:84%
He's just under 40 years old,
so he's kind of a prime specimen

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
see in just a moment

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that even he was really
feeling the workout

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.480 align:middle line:84%
within a minute
or two doing this

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.920 align:middle line:84%
because it engages the
muscles differently.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Before we show
that clip, tell us

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:35.850 align:middle line:84%
what it's actually doing
by way of engaging muscles.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.985 align:middle line:90%
It's an oscillating movement.

00:14:37.985 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: You can see
when we do the demo

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that I have him lean forward
and that I have him turn.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.645 align:middle line:84%
Well, just to go back to
the anatomical reasons

00:14:46.645 --> 00:14:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and why this works, I brought
my handy-dandy spinal model

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.591 align:middle line:90%
with me here.

00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.132 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:52.132 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:90%
I like the science of it all.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: What the
oscillation does,

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:03.710 align:middle line:84%
is it rocks the spine like
this so that it activates

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.160 align:middle line:90%
the muscles around the spine.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.510 align:middle line:84%
So I'm the chiropractor, and I'm
looking at this, and I'm going,

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:90%
this strengthens the low back.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.170 align:middle line:84%
This is the core for
90% of the problems

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that come in to see
the chiropractor.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.670 align:middle line:84%
If the low back is stronger,
they don't come in dying,

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.830 align:middle line:90%
and I can do more in less time.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.330 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.800 align:middle line:90%
They're happier.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So the rocking motion
literally pumps those discs.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.970 align:middle line:84%
These discs make up
one third of our height

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.930 align:middle line:90%
from our head to our tailbone.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.550 align:middle line:84%
These discs have blood supply
that atrophies at about age 22.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:48.980 align:middle line:84%
When it atrophies, these discs,
as a rule, start to atrophy,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and as they do,
that's when we start

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:53.565 align:middle line:84%
to shrivel up and
lose our height.

00:15:53.565 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.940 align:middle line:84%
I had been hanging upside
down as the chiropractor

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:90%
to keep my disc pumped.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not saying it
for vanity purposes,

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.633 align:middle line:90%
I just wanted to be clear.

00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:07.825 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You haven't
lost any of your height.

00:16:07.825 --> 00:16:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Actually,
when I got the machine.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.780 align:middle line:84%
I came home with
the ankle machine,

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:84%
we had just moved into another
house that was built in 1945.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Building standards
were 6 foot 6".

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm 6' 5 and 1/2".

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Two years after we
moved into the house,

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.800 align:middle line:84%
I noticed I'm
brushing the doorways

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.100 align:middle line:90%
as I walk through the doorways.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.849 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: By using
the incline device.

00:16:28.849 --> 00:16:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: No.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:29.931 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No?

00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:90%
By using what?

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.915 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: By using the T-Zone
and having my discs pumped--

00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, this machine?

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: This machine
creates extra circulation

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
around the disc,
so by osmosis, I'm

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.170 align:middle line:84%
getting more nutrients into my
disc, and I'm getting taller.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:46.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
grew an inch or so?

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: No.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.345 align:middle line:90%
About half an inch.

00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:48.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Half an inch?

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.786 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: But it was just
restored, the half an inch

00:16:50.786 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:90%
that I'd lost.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't lost much because
I'd done a lot of things

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:90%
to take care of it.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:01.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, my youngest son, 27, 28,
the first year he used this,

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.654 align:middle line:90%
he grew an inch from the discs.

00:17:05.654 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.556 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Interesting.

00:17:07.556 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.019 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Now, not many
people are interested in that.

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:12.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:14.369 align:middle line:90%
You think not.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:90%
You can tell my stepmom.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.839 align:middle line:90%
She's so tiny now.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:21.349 align:middle line:84%
You know, the reason I was
really jazzed about this

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:23.839 align:middle line:84%
is because after my friend
Susan told me about it,

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.930 align:middle line:84%
we went over to one
of the ZAAZ Studios

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.940 align:middle line:84%
where they have the
machines, where you can--

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:90%
it's like $3 or something.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
You go on for a session
of up to 15 minutes.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.180 align:middle line:84%
And my husband Scott
went on, and he's

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.340 align:middle line:84%
had lower back-- he had a couple
of serious accidents and falls

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.140 align:middle line:84%
when he was younger and has
had constant lower back pain.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.525 align:middle line:84%
And after he got off
of it, he's like, huh.

00:17:43.525 --> 00:17:44.669 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any back pain.

00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, that went on
for quite a while.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember now whether
it was a week or two, just

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.920 align:middle line:84%
in that one
10-minute session, he

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
didn't have any more back pain.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Now over time, it
started creeping

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
back in again, which I
suppose would be natural

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.670 align:middle line:84%
because he didn't
follow up with it.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.499 align:middle line:90%
But that was really, for him--

00:18:00.499 --> 00:18:01.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Dramatic.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --dramatic
to not be in pain.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:04.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So I think what we
should do is now

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
go to you working with Brock and
showing how the machine works

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.900 align:middle line:84%
so people can get an idea
of the motion, the speeds,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.964 align:middle line:84%
the way in which you
engage muscle groups.

00:18:16.964 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to go ahead and
take a look at what we just

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.835 align:middle line:90%
taped a few minutes ago.

00:18:20.835 --> 00:18:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK, Brock.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:26.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to demonstrate to you
the benefits, you the fitness

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.820 align:middle line:84%
guy, the benefits of adding
this to your regimen.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: OK.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: So you have-- how much
time do you spend in the gym?

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.005 align:middle line:84%
>>BROCK: About an
hour, hour and a half.

00:18:35.005 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Hour and
a half every day?

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.423 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: Yeah.

00:18:36.423 --> 00:18:37.750 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Ouch.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.840 align:middle line:90%
That's too much for me.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.320 align:middle line:84%
I've got a three-pound
weight here.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Can I have you hold those?

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
The reason I want
you to do this is I

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.385 align:middle line:84%
wanted to exaggerate
what's going on for you.

00:18:47.385 --> 00:18:48.870 align:middle line:90%
You put it out there.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.345 align:middle line:90%
You're standing straight.

00:18:50.345 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Do a little pelvic tilt for me.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:52.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:53.745 align:middle line:90%
See how that activates the core?

00:18:53.745 --> 00:18:54.328 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: Yeah.

00:18:54.328 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: The three big muscles?

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Pelvic sling?

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:90%
Turn.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Keep a broom handle
across here and turn.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.814 align:middle line:84%
Now, see how it wants
to stop right there?

00:19:03.814 --> 00:19:04.980 align:middle line:90%
And look over your shoulder.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.438 align:middle line:84%
See what you're
pointing out there?

00:19:06.438 --> 00:19:07.897 align:middle line:84%
Feel how this is
working your core?

00:19:07.897 --> 00:19:08.479 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: Yeah.

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.590 align:middle line:84%
We're working the
big three muscles,

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.320 align:middle line:90%
and we're working the obliques.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.940 align:middle line:84%
How much workout do you get
on your obliques in the gym?

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.549 align:middle line:84%
>>BROCK: Oh, a
day or two a week.

00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:17.090 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Looking over there, you're
pointing at the flower pot.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:90%
Turn back here again.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.487 align:middle line:90%
What changed?

00:19:27.487 --> 00:19:28.445 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: More rotation.

00:19:28.445 --> 00:19:29.444 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: More rotation.

00:19:29.444 --> 00:19:32.734 align:middle line:84%
That's-- I mean, yoga people
are really into the flexibility

00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:33.900 align:middle line:90%
more than the weight people.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.525 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: Right.

00:19:34.525 --> 00:19:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: But I mean,
you can appreciate

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
in that amount of time,
a change in flexibility.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.460 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Pelvic tilt again.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:90%
Bend forward.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.569 align:middle line:90%
Hold your hands up here.

00:19:44.569 --> 00:19:45.110 align:middle line:90%
Bend forward.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Pull your belly way up.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.210 align:middle line:90%
Arch your back.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Any activity going
on in your abs?

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: Yes.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.080 align:middle line:90%
Push my hands up.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.430 align:middle line:84%
Any more activity
going on in your abs?

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.158 align:middle line:90%
I can't quite hear you there?

00:20:00.158 --> 00:20:01.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BROCK: Yes.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:01.735 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:01.735 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:90%
Let go for me.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.590 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Standing up there.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
We can exaggerate what's
going on in the body

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:84%
with a little bit of
weight and the repetitions.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.630 align:middle line:84%
This repeats multiple
times a second.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:90%
We can change the speeds.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:90%
It's variable.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's gentle enough that I
can put Granny Goose on here,

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.645 align:middle line:84%
and it's strong enough
that you can get a workout,

00:20:24.645 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
and we really like
that flexibility.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.490 align:middle line:90%
So you can work the shoulders.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.400 align:middle line:84%
You can work the abs,
the core muscles.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.070 align:middle line:90%
You can work the obliques.

00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.041 align:middle line:84%
Let me have you do
this, and do a squat.

00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:39.540 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to slowly come
up and slowly go back down.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
What's different about
doing a squat like this?

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BROCK: Shifting
back and forth.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.296 align:middle line:90%
My balance.

00:20:49.296 --> 00:20:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.070 align:middle line:84%
It makes all the other
stabilizer muscles work.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a linear thing.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Makes a big difference.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, Brock was sweating.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:84%
When he finish up
and was walking out,

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.800 align:middle line:90%
he said he definitely felt it.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:90%
He was feeling the abs.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.393 align:middle line:84%
He was feeling it
all the way through,

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and I see you still have
our little spinal model

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:90%
in your hands.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:84%
So are you going to
show us something

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.040 align:middle line:84%
about the dynamic of what
was happening with him there?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.195 align:middle line:90%
He was getting a workout.

00:21:16.195 --> 00:21:17.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: He was
getting workout.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's two things
I want to go over there.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Number one is I had him,
when he was doing the plank,

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.530 align:middle line:90%
I had him straighten his back.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.870 align:middle line:84%
If the belly is hanging
down, what happens

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is the weight is
carried across here

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
and nothing happens
with the abs.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.620 align:middle line:84%
If the abs are pulled up and
engaged, it loosens this up,

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.067 align:middle line:90%
but it really tones those abs.

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: It's an
amazing ab workout.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing calorie burner.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if he can be sweating
in three, four minutes,

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.810 align:middle line:84%
well he was doing
an aerobic workout,

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:53.435 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:53.435 --> 00:21:56.610 align:middle line:84%
If you're sweating and you
have elevated heart rate,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:57.930 align:middle line:90%
you're-- that's aerobic.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: So was Lauren.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.410 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we put
Granny Goose on there

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.300 align:middle line:84%
and we've got her
feet close together,

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.790 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't take much to
elevate her heart rate.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.900 align:middle line:84%
That becomes an aerobic
workout for her,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.924 align:middle line:84%
but she's not going to do near
the work that Brock would do.

00:22:15.924 --> 00:22:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: OK I
mean, I'm not going

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:90%
to do the work that Brock does.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.490 align:middle line:90%
My muscles don't go there.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:84%
But my muscles do work,
and it takes a lot of work

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:90%
to carry this big body around.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.010 align:middle line:90%
6 foot 6" of you.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So that starts bringing in
a lot of other subjects,

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and we've just been looking
at the fitness end of it,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.290 align:middle line:84%
but there are also a lot
of beneficial effects

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
to the overall
health of the body.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.196 align:middle line:84%
And one thing we were
talking about off camera--

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.070 align:middle line:84%
and I'd love for you to
share this anecdote--

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.140 align:middle line:84%
was that we have more lymphatic
fluids running through

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:50.730 align:middle line:90%
than actual blood.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And that case, that we're
talking about lymphatic

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.547 align:middle line:90%
drainage I take it.

00:22:54.547 --> 00:22:55.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Yes.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you'll tell
me about this one lady

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.150 align:middle line:84%
that you encountered who
didn't like chiropractors.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.260 align:middle line:84%
You told me about
her off camera,

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and what happened, because
that was rather startling.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: The lymph is that--
the guys know what the lymph is

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.780 align:middle line:84%
because they fall and get a
carpet burn or a scrape where

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.922 align:middle line:84%
it's not bleeding, but it's
oozing that clear liquid.

00:23:16.922 --> 00:23:18.880 align:middle line:84%
That's the lymph, and it
runs through our body.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.770 align:middle line:84%
It's extracellular, and it
carries the toxins and wastes

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
out and keeps the nutrient
supply to the cell.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, sometimes in our
sedentary lifestyle,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
things get congested
in the lymph system,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.900 align:middle line:84%
and we notice it because
the lymph nodes are

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.560 align:middle line:84%
in the axilla, the groin,
and the neck, the elbow,

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:90%
and the knee, those five areas.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:84%
But these are the two
biggest-- main areas.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And the lymph goes
through the body

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:84%
and it comes into the thoracic
cavity to be processed,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.620 align:middle line:84%
but it has to go
through the lymph nodes.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we're-- mumps is an
example of lymph node swelling

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and protecting the whole body
by keeping the problem isolated.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.905 align:middle line:84%
Well, somehow this
lady had got--

00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just like a cyst?

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.850 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --congestion
in the lymph node.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:19.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Not a cyst, really?

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: We'll
just call it a lump.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:21.655 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A lump.

00:24:21.655 --> 00:24:22.155 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:22.155 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: --for whatever reason.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.630 align:middle line:90%
It was just a hard spot.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:84%
She showed me the
hard spot in the lymph

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.380 align:middle line:90%
node in the tissue here.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.590 align:middle line:90%
So I put her on the machine--

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --which usually
is very scary to people

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.313 align:middle line:90%
when they find that.

00:24:35.313 --> 00:24:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Usually very scary.

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.411 align:middle line:90%
Understandably so.

00:24:38.411 --> 00:24:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You don't know.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --I've
dealt with patients

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that have had the surgery and
taken that off and the health

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:51.030 align:middle line:84%
issues go on for the rest
of their lives after that.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.447 align:middle line:84%
So what I did was, I
put her on a stool.

00:24:53.447 --> 00:24:54.905 align:middle line:84%
So she was sitting
on the machine--

00:24:54.905 --> 00:24:57.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On a little
stool, on the machine.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --on a little
stool, on the platform.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's going like
this, and what that does

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.140 align:middle line:84%
is it makes all the
water molecules vibrate.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Like if you put this water
glass on a stereo speaker,

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.570 align:middle line:84%
all the water-- you
can see it vibrate.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what's happening
when you sit on the Whole Body

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.500 align:middle line:90%
Vibration Machine.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But if you sit there and
then steer the lymph,

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.180 align:middle line:84%
you could move it like
this, just gently.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.560 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to bring it into
the thoracic cavity or chest

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:34.500 align:middle line:84%
cavity, I just do it like this,
and it's just a light massage.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've had responses from
people that have done that.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.880 align:middle line:84%
I showed them, I said
try this, try this,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.100 align:middle line:84%
and age spots and liver
spots are disappearing

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.190 align:middle line:84%
because the nutrients are
being replaced by new lymph,

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:55.390 align:middle line:84%
by increased circulation,
and so the skin

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.015 align:middle line:90%
is getting measurably healthier.

00:25:58.015 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, what
happened with this lady?

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Well,
this lady had a lump

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.110 align:middle line:84%
about the size of the end of
my thumb and about that hard.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And so I did the
demonstration, and I showed her

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.840 align:middle line:90%
how she could move the lymph.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.840 align:middle line:84%
She could steer
the lymph while it

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.490 align:middle line:84%
was vibrating, while the
molecules were vibrating--

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --while she was
sitting on the device.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.073 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: She's
sitting on the device.

00:26:21.073 --> 00:26:26.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going very fast, and it's
very relaxing when you do that.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:84%
So we did that for
three or four minutes

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.240 align:middle line:84%
and stopped and
talked for a minute,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and lymph starts moving
when you do that.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was unexpected, but we
went and looked for the lump

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.220 align:middle line:90%
and the lump was gone.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was kind of
shocking when you told me that.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: I was shocked too.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't expect it to stay
gone if she goes back

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:52.040 align:middle line:84%
to her sedentary ways,
if she does something

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.770 align:middle line:84%
like this on a daily basis,
I expect it to stay gone.

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So she was
shocked because she wasn't

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.550 align:middle line:84%
a big fan of chiropractic
to begin with,

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:90%
no less your device.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:90%
So she was shocked.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:02.030 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.005 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: She was shocked.

00:27:03.005 --> 00:27:03.505 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:03.505 --> 00:27:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so OK.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.254 align:middle line:84%
Now that brings the subject
of circulation up, in general.

00:27:07.254 --> 00:27:08.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you're
talking about people

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.461 align:middle line:84%
have sedentary
lifestyles, obviously,

00:27:10.461 --> 00:27:12.610 align:middle line:84%
the circulation is
usually not that good.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
We get into things
like diabetes.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.793 align:middle line:90%
We get into what happens--

00:27:15.793 --> 00:27:19.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Let's talk
about general circulation.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:22.030 align:middle line:84%
The rocking motion,
we saw on the demo

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.490 align:middle line:84%
how the rocking motion
affected the three biggest

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:26.890 align:middle line:90%
muscles in the body.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.630 align:middle line:84%
The core, the muscles
of core stability,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.420 align:middle line:84%
doing this exaggerates
the stresses here then

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:90%
the muscles have to respond.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.430 align:middle line:84%
When they respond,
they burn calories,

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.460 align:middle line:84%
but they don't just burn
calories, they burn oxygen.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.210 align:middle line:84%
We have an oxygen sensor in
our brain that says, hello.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:90%
We need more oxygen.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is it triggers

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:90%
and makes us breathe deeper.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.640 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as we
breathe deeper, that

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.660 align:middle line:84%
triggers the heart
to beat faster

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:84%
to get the oxygen and the
nutrients to the body.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.930 align:middle line:84%
When the oxygen and
nutrients go to the body--

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:84%
the brain and the body-- it
makes the blood vessels dilate

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.540 align:middle line:84%
that carry the oxygen
and nutrients there.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:17.130 align:middle line:84%
We're working harder so those
blood vessels, by doing that,

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:90%
have to dilate.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:84%
That dilation makes
them more flexible.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:84%
That prevents hardening of
the arteries or reverses,

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.580 align:middle line:90%
or hardening of the attitudes.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.340 align:middle line:90%
It changes things.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.798 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you've
seen a reversal

00:28:32.798 --> 00:28:35.314 align:middle line:84%
of hardening of the
arteries with this.

00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:37.253 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I've got
no way to measure.

00:28:37.253 --> 00:28:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.255 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I've seen
increased circulation.

00:28:40.255 --> 00:28:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Increased circulation.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:49.930 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: So I just happened
to bring an oxygen meter,

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:84%
and it measures the periphery,
the amount of oxygen

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.445 align:middle line:90%
in the periphery of the blood.

00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:00.280 align:middle line:84%
It's just a little
medical device.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just a handy little thing,
and it measures and shows

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.780 align:middle line:84%
how much-- it shows, looking
at that, you see 95%.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:10.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 96%.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --96% oxygen
at the periphery.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I measure people and then
put them on the machine

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:20.520 align:middle line:90%
and then measure again.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.630 align:middle line:84%
In 95% of the time
there's an improvement

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.370 align:middle line:90%
in oxygen at the periphery.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a good thing.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:90%
You used the diabetes word.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just because it's
becoming almost an epidemic now

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.851 align:middle line:90%
for a variety of reasons.

00:29:36.851 --> 00:29:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:40.250 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I think the
definition of epidemic

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
has changed so that
it isn't an epidemic.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:45.360 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.590 align:middle line:84%
The yardstick has
become more flexible.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's circulation to
the lower extremities.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:57.315 align:middle line:84%
My wife's uncle had his
leg amputated at the knee.

00:29:57.315 --> 00:29:59.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I've seen ulcerations
and that sort of thing.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Ulcerations
that don't get better.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So how
does this affect it?

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I assume, if this
increases circulation,

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.450 align:middle line:84%
you're definitely
lowering the risk

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.180 align:middle line:84%
of having that kind of
stagnancy in the limbs.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Well,
people don't ask me

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:15.060 align:middle line:84%
the question as
the chiropractor,

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:21.132 align:middle line:84%
but I see it-- when I see
someone, I see the sore,

00:30:21.132 --> 00:30:23.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to bring it up
if there's a sore on your leg.

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:26.090 align:middle line:84%
That's not my place
to bring it up.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.500 align:middle line:84%
But I see the improvements
when I see you

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.250 align:middle line:84%
again in a month, two
months, three months.

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I've seen ulcerations,
pre-ulcerations where

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:47.020 align:middle line:84%
the skin hadn't broken, go
from here to here in a day,

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.290 align:middle line:84%
and I got phone reports
from these people

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.210 align:middle line:84%
because I travel around to
different States doing this.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.465 align:middle line:84%
I get phone reports,
it cleared up.

00:30:56.465 --> 00:30:59.280 align:middle line:84%
The ulceration had
been five years.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:30:59.940 align:middle line:90%
It healed.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.650 align:middle line:90%
I get stories like that.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:03.630 align:middle line:90%
That's impressive.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's very impressive.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So you talked about this
in the very beginning,

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and I think it might have
been when you were speaking

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:14.790 align:middle line:84%
with Brock when he
was on the device,

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and that is about the
notion of osteoporosis.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.085 align:middle line:84%
Before we get into pain
management, but osteoporosis.

00:31:20.085 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.220 align:middle line:84%
One more anecdote about
diabetes before I leave.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.695 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:31:26.695 --> 00:31:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Diabetic neuropathy
is the other thing.

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:31.410 align:middle line:90%
There's a loss of sensation.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:84%
It starts in the toes, the
feet, the ankle, the leg.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.820 align:middle line:90%
It moves up.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And that neuropathy
or loss of sensation

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.380 align:middle line:84%
is part of a balance
problem, but it's

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.970 align:middle line:90%
part of a circulation problem.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's part of a nervous
system problem.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.600 align:middle line:84%
But I have, in the
last 4 and 1/2 years,

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.030 align:middle line:84%
working with this
manufacturer, I

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:56.720 align:middle line:84%
have seen demonstrated to
hundreds and hundreds of people

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that we've measured
diabetic neuropathy

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:84%
and seen a measurable
improvement 99%

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.030 align:middle line:84%
of the time in two
or three minutes.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, the ones that have
got real excited about it

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and got the machines are
phoning and reporting,

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:90%
Doc, it's cleared up.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.240 align:middle line:90%
It's staying away.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.169 align:middle line:90%
You're hurting your practice.

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:18.960 align:middle line:84%
People aren't going to
come back to see you

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.370 align:middle line:90%
because it clears up.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going, that's what
I. I want you out the door.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what does it
do to the primary aspects

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.100 align:middle line:90%
of blood sugar and so forth?

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, does it affect
because of the circulation,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.470 align:middle line:84%
increased oxygen
supply and so forth?

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.440 align:middle line:84%
Does it actually
affect then core issue

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.990 align:middle line:84%
of diabetes, the
blood sugar levels?

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Well, we're
talking about fitness.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.370 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
exercising the three biggest

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
muscles of the
body, and then we're

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.940 align:middle line:84%
talking about exercising
all the stabilizer muscles.

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you'd have to
say it has to impact it.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.890 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Then we're talking
about burning calories.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.755 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
increased oxygen uptake.

00:32:49.755 --> 00:32:51.505 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
increased circulation.

00:32:51.505 --> 00:32:53.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: In other words, duh.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:53.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.657 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:32:54.657 --> 00:32:55.571 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I was
too polite to say.

00:32:55.571 --> 00:32:56.154 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Duh.

00:32:56.154 --> 00:32:56.942 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:32:56.942 --> 00:32:59.552 align:middle line:84%
Now, another surprising
area I was reading about,

00:32:59.552 --> 00:33:01.010 align:middle line:84%
I was reading some
of the research,

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.395 align:middle line:84%
and I was reading this
on Dr. Mercola's site.

00:33:03.395 --> 00:33:04.770 align:middle line:10%
I mean, there are
a lot of people

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:07.280 align:middle line:10%
that are talking about
this technology out there

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.890 align:middle line:10%
and using different
versions of it,

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.899 align:middle line:10%
but they were talking about
fibromyalgia and the pain

00:33:11.899 --> 00:33:13.440 align:middle line:10%
relief that some
people were getting.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.880 align:middle line:90%
Now, why and how does that work?

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people
have severe fibromyalgia,

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.150 align:middle line:84%
which I've interviewed
people that

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.495 align:middle line:84%
say that's kind of a garbage
bucket diagnosis for pain,

00:33:24.495 --> 00:33:25.170 align:middle line:90%
in general.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.392 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: There I go.

00:33:26.392 --> 00:33:27.718 align:middle line:90%
I was too polite to say.

00:33:27.718 --> 00:33:30.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you have this
kind of undiagnosed pain

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.150 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.858 align:middle line:84%
You'd think that that
would be too harsh.

00:33:32.858 --> 00:33:38.030 align:middle line:10%
>>GAINOR: When I first went
on the road for the company

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:10%
doing demos, agents would
set up demos for me,

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.360 align:middle line:10%
and I was doing a demo
in a health food store,

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.150 align:middle line:10%
and I was asked that question.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.632 align:middle line:84%
And a lady came
shuffling forward.

00:33:47.632 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:90%
What will it do for me?

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I've got fibromyalgia.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.190 align:middle line:84%
"I don't know what it
will do for you," I said,

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:55.710 align:middle line:84%
"but I know that there's
18 trigger points

00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to have 11 of
them for the American Arthritic

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Society to diagnose
you as fibromyalgia."

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:06.560 align:middle line:84%
She says, "I've had it for 11
years, and I've got all 18."

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.420 align:middle line:90%
I said, "Let's measure one."

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:12.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I mean, it's tricky
in a health food store,

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.130 align:middle line:84%
in a big group to
find a measurement,

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.540 align:middle line:84%
so she showed me the
side of her thigh.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:18.790 align:middle line:90%
She said, that's really sore.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK,
can I touch that?

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So I just touched her
thigh, and I really

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:84%
know how to be
gentle with someone,

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:29.199 align:middle line:84%
and I just lightly touched her
thigh, and she goes like this.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.639 align:middle line:90%
And she's in pain.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "There's
a measurement.

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.389 align:middle line:90%
Let's put you on the machine.

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:36.274 align:middle line:90%
OK?"

00:34:36.274 --> 00:34:38.440 align:middle line:84%
We stand there. "We'll put
your feet close together.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.040 align:middle line:90%
You're going to oscillate.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:84%
I want you to turn like this
because I'm the chiropractor.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.389 align:middle line:84%
I want to put a torque on that
spine, and affect those discs,

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and I want to affect the
nerve roots that come out

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.500 align:middle line:84%
from there that
go down your legs.

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.860 align:middle line:84%
But I'm also, if you're
torquing like that,

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.570 align:middle line:84%
torquing this way will
cause an internal rotation

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.600 align:middle line:84%
on this thigh, and this
knee, and this ankle,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and then turning the other
way, external rotation on that.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And that affects those
muscles and the nerves,

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.240 align:middle line:84%
and that increases muscle
responses and circulation,

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and stimulates the body
to function better.

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what it's
going to do for you."

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.667 align:middle line:84%
So I put her on
for three minutes.

00:35:17.667 --> 00:35:18.250 align:middle line:90%
She's fragile.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.124 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go longer
than that because I

00:35:20.124 --> 00:35:21.910 align:middle line:90%
don't want her to overdo it.

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.880 align:middle line:84%
I take her off, and I feel her,
like I can feel the difference.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I first felt
the leg, it was like that.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.050 align:middle line:84%
When I felt it the second
time, it was fleshy.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:31.976 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More fluid.

00:35:31.976 --> 00:35:34.840 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: It had
relaxed and changed.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.282 align:middle line:90%
So I knew that, and I went--

00:35:37.282 --> 00:35:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --really
hard on her leg.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: --really hard.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And she started to cry because
for the first time in like 17

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:90%
years, she was out of pain.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:54.970 align:middle line:84%
She was so thrilled that I could
do that, and she didn't die.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.720 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.660 align:middle line:90%
I went, wow.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's
one anecdote,

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and I've read
about, like I said,

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.430 align:middle line:84%
I was reading that
in some research.

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.910 align:middle line:84%
It's proving to be pretty
effective with fibromyalgia.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:06.960 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.460 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.502 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: I've seen that.

00:36:08.502 --> 00:36:09.751 align:middle line:90%
You talked about osteoporosis.

00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I did.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Osteoporosis is a
loss of bone density.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.105 align:middle line:84%
That goes back to
the cosmonaut issue.

00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:84%
When they're
weightless in space,

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
the astronauts and
cosmonauts lose bone density.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:30.160 align:middle line:84%
Then we go to our Easy Boy
chairs, and the loss of motion

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:30.696 align:middle line:90%
leads to--

00:36:30.696 --> 00:36:31.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.486 align:middle line:84%
We're supposedly have to
have that percussive effect

00:36:33.486 --> 00:36:35.220 align:middle line:84%
on our bodies by
walking or whatnot.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Walking.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.770 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:38.940 align:middle line:90%
But not just any walking.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.337 align:middle line:90%
Shopping is walking like this.

00:36:41.337 --> 00:36:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Brisk walking.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I got ya.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:49.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --where your
feet are making a noise.

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Brisk walking
creates what's known

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:57.410 align:middle line:84%
as a piezoelectric effect, and
that piezoelectric effect goes

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:84%
through all the
bones in the body.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:06.030 align:middle line:84%
I was reading a French study
where they use this technology.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, Geriatric Joe is going
to be interested in this

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:14.000 align:middle line:84%
because to do a
dental implant today,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.670 align:middle line:84%
the jaw bone has to have a
certain amount of density

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.070 align:middle line:84%
for that titanium to
hold the titanium screw

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to put the implant on top.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.730 align:middle line:90%
If it's not dense enough, sorry.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.020 align:middle line:90%
We can't help you.

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.898 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nothing to
hold on to, unless they

00:37:29.898 --> 00:37:31.148 align:middle line:90%
do bone grafting and all that.

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:33.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: This French
study showed an increase

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:38.070 align:middle line:84%
in bone density in the jaw in 30
days from using the technology.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.302 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:37:39.302 --> 00:37:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: That's impressive.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's the piezoelectric
effect calling for minerals

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.580 align:middle line:84%
to be laid down to make
the bones stronger.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.020 align:middle line:84%
The sedentary lifestyle,
sitting in the Easy Boy

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:57.490 align:middle line:84%
with the remote going
for five hours before bed

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:03.660 align:middle line:84%
calls for the minerals to
be taken out of the bone,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:84%
for the bones to get weaker,
softer, more brittle.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:12.410 align:middle line:84%
That's where in 1970,
there was 100,000 Americans

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.880 align:middle line:90%
broke their hip and fell.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.870 align:middle line:84%
Didn't fall and break their
hip, broke their hip and fell.

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:84%
In 1990, it was a
quarter million,

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and I have not seen
studies since then.

00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:27.745 align:middle line:84%
It was going downhill because
we're getting more sedentary.

00:38:27.745 --> 00:38:28.700 align:middle line:90%
The lifestyle.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.540 align:middle line:84%
We have more conveniences
than we used to.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.535 align:middle line:84%
That brisk walk
makes a difference.

00:38:33.535 --> 00:38:35.630 align:middle line:84%
The exercise bicycle
doesn't do it.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:36.874 align:middle line:90%
The swimming doesn't do it.

00:38:36.874 --> 00:38:38.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have to have
that percussive motion.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:39.505 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Right.

00:38:39.505 --> 00:38:40.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:40.810 align:middle line:90%
The friction.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:41.320 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: It does.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.065 align:middle line:84%
And so the machine is
essentially supplanting that.

00:38:44.065 --> 00:38:45.490 align:middle line:90%
I mean it is doing that for you.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: It's
doing that for you.

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.628 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now,
I mean, this is

00:38:47.628 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
another area is because like I
said in the beginning of this,

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:56.790 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like it's a panacea
for everyone of some kind.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.710 align:middle line:84%
But in reality, it actually is
having these effects on people.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't really like
talking about product that

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.431 align:middle line:84%
much, but it seems pretty
pervasive in its effects.

00:39:07.431 --> 00:39:07.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I brought the
first one of these in America

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:13.440 align:middle line:90%
down to my mother.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Mom and dad retired
to Palm Springs.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.410 align:middle line:90%
She was 85.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.652 align:middle line:90%
She was falling daily.

00:39:19.652 --> 00:39:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: My dad's falling.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I took one
to her, and she was all

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:28.610 align:middle line:84%
excited to see me because I
drove down from Canada to see

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.200 align:middle line:90%
her, brought her a machine.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.560 align:middle line:84%
She comes shuffling in,
reaching on furniture.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.750 align:middle line:90%
She didn't need a cane.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.712 align:middle line:90%
She could touch furniture.

00:39:36.712 --> 00:39:39.170 align:middle line:84%
I put her on the machine for
two minutes, made her get off.

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.170 align:middle line:90%
She wanted to go longer.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.040 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't let her.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.290 align:middle line:90%
She didn't have another fall--

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.946 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --until they took it
away from her in a old folks

00:39:47.946 --> 00:39:48.445 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:39:48.445 --> 00:39:50.310 align:middle line:84%
They wouldn't let
her use the machine.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:55.375 align:middle line:84%
But to stop falling, like
that, that's impressive.

00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.500 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.850 align:middle line:84%
Because it's constant risk
of ending up in the ER

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:00.891 align:middle line:84%
and then ending up somewhere
where you don't want

00:40:00.891 --> 00:40:02.417 align:middle line:84%
to be in bed for a
really long time.

00:40:02.417 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take it
to the other end.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
the vanity part,

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.495 align:middle line:84%
you have Lauren, our beautiful
Lauren here on the machine,

00:40:10.495 --> 00:40:11.620 align:middle line:90%
and you were showing there.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take a quick
look at that clip

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:18.200 align:middle line:84%
of how it works on toning the
upper muscles, the upper body

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.140 align:middle line:84%
muscles and arms in particular,
this part of the arm on women,

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.700 align:middle line:90%
also the belly area.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take
a really quick peek

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:30.071 align:middle line:84%
at what that looked like on
video just a few minutes ago.

00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:31.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK, Lauren.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you a couple of
the benefits of using the ZAAZ

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Whole Body Vibration Machine.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.820 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:84%
It has benefits for someone
like you who's obviously fit.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:46.280 align:middle line:84%
It has benefits for Granny
Goose who's sedentary,

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.800 align:middle line:90%
and it has benefits for kids.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.030 align:middle line:84%
It's very flexible
in what it can do,

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:57.380 align:middle line:84%
and I'll show you how you
can control the intensity so

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.870 align:middle line:84%
that you don't need
to be concerned

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.539 align:middle line:84%
when you put your
grandmother on here.

00:41:00.539 --> 00:41:01.080 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: OK.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.430 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Let me have you step up on here.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.570 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: All right.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: It oscillates.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.700 align:middle line:84%
It goes right, left,
right, left, right, left.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.140 align:middle line:90%
It does it gently.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.030 align:middle line:84%
It's designed for bone
density and muscle mass.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.010 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you how
it will do the muscles,

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.020 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about bone
density at another time.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I want it going fast enough
that you can feel it going.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.782 align:middle line:90%


00:41:23.782 --> 00:41:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to hold
a one-pound weight

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:27.775 align:middle line:90%
to exaggerate what's going on.

00:41:27.775 --> 00:41:28.275 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:28.275 --> 00:41:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: All right.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Now, if you just stand
there relaxed like that, if I

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:36.360 align:middle line:84%
feel the back of your arm
here, what muscle is this?

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>LAUREN: I'm
really bad at this.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:39.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.170 align:middle line:90%
It's called angel's wings.

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.650 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: OK.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: And ladies that
wear short-sleeved shirts

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.161 align:middle line:90%
are embarrassed with that.

00:41:48.161 --> 00:41:48.660 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Right.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: So what I want you
to do with your arms straight

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.300 align:middle line:84%
is just pull your
arms straight back.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:53.555 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: OK.

00:41:53.555 --> 00:41:54.096 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:41:54.096 --> 00:41:55.050 align:middle line:90%
What happened here?

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>>LAUREN: I feel a
tightening there.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: It tightened up
pretty good, didn't it?

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:58.685 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Yeah.

00:41:58.685 --> 00:42:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: It activates
those muscles.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:00.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Those are the triceps, but
it activates those muscles

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and can give you tone there
to prevent angel's wings.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:10.720 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one
little thing you can do.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:15.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me put your
hands up like this.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:19.040 align:middle line:84%
That exaggerates what's
going on through your core.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, notice how you pulled
your belly in as soon

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:24.400 align:middle line:90%
as you pulled your hands up.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.670 align:middle line:84%
This is something
as a chiropractor,

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.980 align:middle line:84%
we want to train people
to do, activate your core

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.290 align:middle line:84%
before you pick up the box
so you don't hurt your back.

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:36.824 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how slowly you say
it for men, they don't get it.

00:42:36.824 --> 00:42:37.670 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.840 align:middle line:90%
You can cut that out.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:84%
So you activated your
core, and the core

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:47.280 align:middle line:84%
is your abs, your
glutes, and your quads.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.040 align:middle line:84%
OK, those are the three
biggest muscles on your body.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.870 align:middle line:84%
When you activate those just
standing here doing that,

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:53.817 align:middle line:90%
those are activated.

00:42:53.817 --> 00:42:55.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get you
to move your feet right

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:56.691 align:middle line:90%
to the edge of the plate.

00:42:56.691 --> 00:42:57.271 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: OK.

00:42:57.271 --> 00:42:57.770 align:middle line:90%
Both?

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:58.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Both.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: All right.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.829 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: More.

00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:02.218 align:middle line:90%
What's different?

00:43:02.218 --> 00:43:03.759 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: A lot more vibration.

00:43:03.759 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: A lot more vibration.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:05.742 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:05.742 --> 00:43:07.566 align:middle line:90%
A lot more muscle response here.

00:43:07.566 --> 00:43:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Definitely.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.130 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Now.

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
These are the three biggest
muscles on the body.

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Is anyone interested in
shaping those three areas?

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Yes.

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.490 align:middle line:90%
I am.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I think you're
pretty normal that way.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.270 align:middle line:84%
That's where most of us
are interested in shaping.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.100 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's a hard one to do.

00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:26.861 align:middle line:84%
This one is the
hardest one of all.

00:43:26.861 --> 00:43:27.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.680 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to get you
to do is hold that there.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.689 align:middle line:84%
Now, hold this and straighten
your knees, and bend forward.

00:43:32.689 --> 00:43:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: OK.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.703 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Bend.

00:43:33.703 --> 00:43:34.203 align:middle line:90%
Bend.

00:43:34.203 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Bend.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Now, pull this up more.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.890 align:middle line:90%
More, more, more.

00:43:37.890 --> 00:43:38.990 align:middle line:90%
Arch your back.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.660 align:middle line:90%
Angry cat.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.180 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.430 align:middle line:90%
Feel how that does more?

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:43.242 align:middle line:90%
That's kundalini breath in yoga?

00:43:43.242 --> 00:43:45.586 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Yep.

00:43:45.586 --> 00:43:46.382 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:43:46.382 --> 00:43:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Kundalini breath.

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:48.350 align:middle line:90%
Pull this way up.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.150 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, put your hands
out here, and see

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.196 align:middle line:84%
how that exaggerates what's
going on in your abs there?

00:43:55.196 --> 00:43:56.070 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Definitely.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:56.569 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:57.360 align:middle line:90%
I feel it.

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.480 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: They find that
standing ab crunches are more

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.325 align:middle line:84%
powerful than
lying-on-the-floor ab crunches.

00:44:03.325 --> 00:44:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: OK.

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: And on here, because
you're on at a higher speed,

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.630 align:middle line:84%
you're getting like
20 reps a second,

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.600 align:middle line:84%
and that's why a small weight
makes a difference here

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.050 align:middle line:90%
and here.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:16.645 align:middle line:90%
Angry cat.

00:44:16.645 --> 00:44:18.870 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, stick your butt in the
air, and do the old horse.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.992 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:44:25.992 --> 00:44:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: That's hard.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:28.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Trick question.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:28.920 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.600 align:middle line:90%
It is hard.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.020 align:middle line:90%
Pull this up here.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.060 align:middle line:84%
We're interested in
activating the abs.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Pull it up, kundalini
breath again.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.530 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Those are really working.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:40.830 align:middle line:90%
That's burning calories.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:41.690 align:middle line:90%
That's what we want.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:42.273 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Yep.

00:44:42.273 --> 00:44:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Pull this up here.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, you work out
regularly how much?

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.040 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Three times a week.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.248 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Three times a week.

00:44:48.248 --> 00:44:48.841 align:middle line:90%
For?

00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:49.590 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: An hour.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.339 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: An hour.

00:44:50.339 --> 00:44:51.364 align:middle line:90%
In the gym?

00:44:51.364 --> 00:44:52.780 align:middle line:84%
>>LAUREN: Usually
outside running.

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Outside running.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:54.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.577 align:middle line:84%
You can see how this
would compliment

00:44:55.577 --> 00:44:56.910 align:middle line:90%
what you're doing with your run.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:57.785 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Definitely.

00:44:57.785 --> 00:44:58.370 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Can you hear breathing,
how you're working harder?

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:00.985 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Yeah.

00:45:00.985 --> 00:45:02.760 align:middle line:90%
And I feel it in my abs, yeah.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.176 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: You feel
it in your abs.

00:45:04.176 --> 00:45:06.007 align:middle line:84%
They've been working,
and you've got

00:45:06.007 --> 00:45:07.590 align:middle line:84%
a little shortness
of breath going on.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.320 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: Definitely.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:08.861 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So this would complement
you the runner

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and prevent angels
wings in the future.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:15.726 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: That's good.

00:45:15.726 --> 00:45:16.974 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK?

00:45:16.974 --> 00:45:17.810 align:middle line:90%
>>LAUREN: All right.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Thank you very much.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:24.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you're not saying
that this supplants exercise,

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.225 align:middle line:84%
but more that it
complements exercise?

00:45:26.225 --> 00:45:28.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: It
complements exercise.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.630 align:middle line:84%
But you look at
my mother, all she

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:34.035 align:middle line:90%
got was the geriatric shuffle.

00:45:34.035 --> 00:45:34.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK?

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:39.487 align:middle line:84%
Now she got oscillation, right,
left, right, left, right, left.

00:45:39.487 --> 00:45:41.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's a fabulous
place for someone sedentary

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.350 align:middle line:84%
to kind of get up and start
getting their body back

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:45.210 align:middle line:90%
into motion again.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:45.876 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Right.

00:45:45.876 --> 00:45:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Putting it in motion,
increase the circulation,

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.300 align:middle line:84%
keep the blood vessels
flexible, reset the circuits

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.300 align:middle line:90%
to the brain.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.732 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no other
benefits, who cares?

00:45:55.732 --> 00:45:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:57.540 align:middle line:90%
Who cares.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.750 align:middle line:84%
So Brock works out an hour
a day sometimes an hour

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:01.950 align:middle line:90%
and a half a day.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.140 align:middle line:84%
So realistically,
if you're doing this

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're working
out, does that cut down

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:09.020 align:middle line:84%
the amount you need to work
out, or do people just kind of

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.606 align:middle line:90%
add it in, or what do they do?

00:46:10.606 --> 00:46:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I ask
the question: who

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.850 align:middle line:84%
needs to work out an
hour and a half a day?

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:14.687 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, I mean no.

00:46:14.687 --> 00:46:16.810 align:middle line:84%
We saw him stressing
after a couple of minutes.

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So if he'd done a 15-minute
workout very pointedly working

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:23.792 align:middle line:84%
with the plank position and
some of the other things

00:46:23.792 --> 00:46:25.500 align:middle line:84%
you were showing us
on camera, would that

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.055 align:middle line:84%
be adequate for most people
to stay in pretty good shape?

00:46:30.055 --> 00:46:32.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: It depends
on what they want.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:33.710 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:36.654 align:middle line:84%
It's like all the
literature says

00:46:36.654 --> 00:46:39.070 align:middle line:84%
you should only use this for
10 minutes three times a day,

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going, why
would you say that?

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.462 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.462 --> 00:46:45.920 align:middle line:84%
Where in the
literature does it say

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.599 align:middle line:84%
you can only go to the gym for
half hour, three times a week?

00:46:48.599 --> 00:46:49.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why do they say that?

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.845 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there some
damage than can occur?

00:46:51.845 --> 00:46:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: I've got no idea.

00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:54.886 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why is the
manufacturer saying that?

00:46:54.886 --> 00:46:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Well,
everybody says that.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.640 align:middle line:90%
The whole industry says that.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And I don't understand why
because there isn't limits

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.476 align:middle line:90%
on going to the gym, but--

00:47:06.476 --> 00:47:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you shake
yourself too much?

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Oh, yes.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.461 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you have
detrimental effects?

00:47:10.461 --> 00:47:12.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: Well, I'll
give you an example.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.970 align:middle line:84%
I had a lady come to see
me who was on dialysis.

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:17.850 align:middle line:90%
She's 70 years old.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And she saw the
benefits of the machine,

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.230 align:middle line:84%
and she'd driven three
hours to see the demo.

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:26.470 align:middle line:90%
I put the machine in her car.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I said, don't even try
to get it out yourself.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.100 align:middle line:90%
Have a man do it.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Have him put it
together, and then

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:35.030 align:middle line:84%
use it for two to three
minutes once a day for a week,

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.360 align:middle line:84%
twice a day for a week,
three times a day for a week,

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.526 align:middle line:90%
four times a day for a week.

00:47:38.526 --> 00:47:40.140 align:middle line:90%
Gradually build up.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I got a phone call
from her about 10 days,

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:44.305 align:middle line:90%
two weeks later.

00:47:44.305 --> 00:47:44.930 align:middle line:90%
She says, yeah.

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:45.555 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:47:45.555 --> 00:47:47.667 align:middle line:90%
I got the machine together.

00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:48.375 align:middle line:90%
It was yesterday.

00:47:48.375 --> 00:47:51.074 align:middle line:84%
I finally found a guy to do
it, and he put it together,

00:47:51.074 --> 00:47:53.240 align:middle line:84%
and I was on it for 10
minutes, and it felt so good,

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.010 align:middle line:90%
and I'm just so excited.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:54.843 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much.

00:47:54.843 --> 00:47:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Then she's-- now
I've got a question.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Why can't I get
out of bed today?

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And I said, what part
of two to three minutes

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:03.904 align:middle line:90%
did you not understand.

00:48:03.904 --> 00:48:06.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: --did you not hear?

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: She was in
bed for three days,

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:11.602 align:middle line:84%
but she knew that
she had overdone it.

00:48:11.602 --> 00:48:13.060 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
standing on it, you

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.390 align:middle line:90%
don't think you're overdoing it.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.510 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:15.845 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't feel
uncomfortable or anything.

00:48:15.845 --> 00:48:18.386 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: I mean, there's times
after I've been doing a demo,

00:48:18.386 --> 00:48:20.840 align:middle line:84%
like if I'm doing a demo
at a health food store

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.290 align:middle line:84%
or at a ZAAZ Studio
where I'm doing

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:26.275 align:middle line:84%
a demo for multiple
hours, sometimes 2:00

00:48:26.275 --> 00:48:27.650 align:middle line:84%
or 3:00 in the
morning, I wake up

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.700 align:middle line:90%
and I go, oh, my stomach hurts.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.500 align:middle line:90%
What did I eat?

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:31.233 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You
engaged your muscles.

00:48:31.233 --> 00:48:31.774 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Oh.

00:48:31.774 --> 00:48:34.700 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't what I
ate, I overdid it.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.544 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We're going to talk
about the technology itself

00:48:37.544 --> 00:48:38.210 align:middle line:90%
in a little bit.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.430 align:middle line:84%
We have only really
a few minutes left.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.010 align:middle line:84%
But I want you to
share the story

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:45.840 align:middle line:84%
you shared with me yesterday
about the little boy who

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.150 align:middle line:90%
was exposed to it.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:51.230 align:middle line:90%
He was autistic,

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: ADHD or
autistic borderline,

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.510 align:middle line:84%
was having trouble in
school, and I showed him

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.860 align:middle line:84%
how to do the machine, and
then I took some things

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.660 align:middle line:84%
from educational
kinesiology on how

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:06.570 align:middle line:84%
to do the acupuncture
points in the ear lobes

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:09.740 align:middle line:90%
and to cross pattern.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.030 align:middle line:84%
We talked with Brock about
the cross patterning,

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's what isn't
happening from my understanding

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:25.950 align:middle line:84%
as the holistic practitioner
in that ADD autistic community

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:27.110 align:middle line:90%
isn't happening.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:29.840 align:middle line:84%
I put him on the machine
and talked to him

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.189 align:middle line:90%
for eight minutes.

00:49:31.189 --> 00:49:32.813 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Just kind
of distracting him.

00:49:32.813 --> 00:49:33.541 align:middle line:90%
Telling him what to do?

00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: No.

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:35.840 align:middle line:84%
I was lecturing
him on what to do--

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Lecturing.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:36.499 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:36.499 --> 00:49:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: --the whole time.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And when I turned him, I
would physically turn him.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I did so, I
walked around the machine

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:46.100 align:middle line:84%
so that I would keep
eye contact with him.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And his mother had not
seen that with him before.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.410 align:middle line:84%
She had not seen him
keep eye contact.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:54.750 align:middle line:90%
So she was impressed with that.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.380 align:middle line:84%
But she phoned me
up six months later.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:59.690 align:middle line:84%
She's says, Ian,
he's 13 years old.

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:02.000 align:middle line:84%
He was reading at
age 5 and 1/2 level--

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When
you first met him.

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: --when
I first met him.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.970 align:middle line:90%
We put him on the machine.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I gave him the
assignment of doing it

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:09.885 align:middle line:84%
before school, at lunch
time, and after school,

00:50:09.885 --> 00:50:11.390 align:middle line:90%
and before bed.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.660 align:middle line:90%
He followed through on that.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:18.030 align:middle line:84%
His reading skills went from
age 5 and 1/2 to age 14.

00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.940 align:middle line:84%
His attention span
expanded exponentially.

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.720 align:middle line:90%
He was asking for serious books.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.330 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't disrupting
his classes.

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:30.990 align:middle line:84%
His grades went from D's
and C's to B's, a few A's.

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:33.020 align:middle line:84%
The principal was phoning
her up and saying,

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.850 align:middle line:84%
whatever you're
doing, keep it up.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:35.795 align:middle line:90%
We love it.

00:50:35.795 --> 00:50:36.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.030 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: OK.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a life-changing
event, and I've

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:45.640 align:middle line:84%
had ADD therapists
see the benefits.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.640 align:middle line:84%
They just get the benefits
for that right away.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure Yeah.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Very cool.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Well, OK.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking
at this technology,

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and I'm so impressed
with just the bits I've

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.480 align:middle line:84%
seen in my own
private life, and then

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:02.500 align:middle line:84%
what I saw you do here today as
well with Lauren and with Brock

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.305 align:middle line:84%
and just learning more about the
potentials on a healing level

00:51:05.305 --> 00:51:07.180 align:middle line:84%
alone even though we're
not talking about it.

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:08.430 align:middle line:90%
We're not diagnosing anything.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:10.510 align:middle line:84%
There's no medical
advice happening here.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:11.620 align:middle line:90%
There's our disclaimer.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.750 align:middle line:90%
That's out of the way.

00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:15.430 align:middle line:84%
But these technologies, there
are a lot of these devices

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:18.650 align:middle line:84%
out there, and so what's
a general hallmark

00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:21.550 align:middle line:84%
if someone wants to go-- well,
if they want to go do this one,

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.230 align:middle line:90%
you need to go to a ZAAZ Studio.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:25.070 align:middle line:84%
But they're only
in about 10 cities

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.160 align:middle line:90%
right now as I understand.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: They're growing.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:27.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They're growing.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.636 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't
find a ZAAZ Studio

00:51:28.636 --> 00:51:31.400 align:middle line:84%
and you decide you
want to try to buy

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.107 align:middle line:84%
one of these types of devices,
what are the hallmarks

00:51:34.107 --> 00:51:36.190 align:middle line:84%
you need to look for,
because people go on the net

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:37.540 align:middle line:90%
and start searching under it.

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:84%
What is the name of this
type of device in general?

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Is that the-- what
you said before?

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.195 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Oscillation.

00:51:42.195 --> 00:51:43.404 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oscillation device.

00:51:43.404 --> 00:51:44.069 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Right.

00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.970 align:middle line:84%
So what is it they
need to look for that's

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:49.375 align:middle line:84%
going to work versus
one that might jar you.

00:51:49.375 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I know they're some that--
they get more complaints

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.745 align:middle line:84%
because people are
getting jarred.

00:51:52.745 --> 00:51:53.411 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Right.

00:51:53.411 --> 00:52:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And the linear ones
go to disruption

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.590 align:middle line:90%
like we did with Brock.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:07.959 align:middle line:84%
And they're for fitness, and
they're for big, strong people.

00:52:07.959 --> 00:52:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When you
say linear, you're

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.742 align:middle line:84%
talking about an
up-and-down motion?

00:52:10.742 --> 00:52:11.325 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Yes.

00:52:11.325 --> 00:52:11.946 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:52:11.946 --> 00:52:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: And the oscillation,
I would put all of my patients

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:15.560 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.740 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of provisos warning.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.940 align:middle line:84%
You can't go on if
you've got a pacemaker.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've had medical doctors
as patients see that it's not

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.030 align:middle line:84%
going to stress their
pacemaker, and they go, oh.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.080 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a lot to get
past their defenses on that

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:33.946 align:middle line:84%
because they're
nervous about it.

00:52:33.946 --> 00:52:34.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.155 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: They're nervous
about named conditions.

00:52:37.155 --> 00:52:38.970 align:middle line:84%
I don't go into
named conditions.

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:42.250 align:middle line:84%
If you can walk, you can go
on the oscillation machine,

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:44.110 align:middle line:84%
start slowly, two
to three minutes,

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:46.630 align:middle line:84%
and I've had many
people overdo it,

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and when they cut back and
start again, it's real easy.

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:52.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's one
thing my friend said.

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, she's very fit, the one
that turned me onto it, Susan.

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:57.490 align:middle line:90%
She works out a lot.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:59.520 align:middle line:84%
She does a lot of hiking
and running and yoga

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.930 align:middle line:90%
and weights and everything.

00:53:00.930 --> 00:53:04.001 align:middle line:84%
So she went on at the highest
speed for a long time, I mean,

00:53:04.001 --> 00:53:04.750 align:middle line:90%
right off the bat.

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And she said, it
she said it was kind

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.640 align:middle line:84%
of irritating her
bladder a little bit,

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.335 align:middle line:84%
so then she had
to back off on it.

00:53:09.335 --> 00:53:11.219 align:middle line:84%
So that said, you
don't want to do that.

00:53:11.219 --> 00:53:12.010 align:middle line:90%
But she backed off.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.290 align:middle line:84%
As soon as she backed
off on the speed of it,

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.397 align:middle line:90%
she said it was fine.

00:53:15.397 --> 00:53:17.230 align:middle line:84%
It was just an irritation
from overdoing it.

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:18.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's the key.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.370 align:middle line:90%
Don't overdo it.

00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.890 align:middle line:84%
You want something
that oscillates

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.830 align:middle line:84%
rather than like this
unless you're already

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:24.722 align:middle line:90%
fairly fit athlete.

00:53:24.722 --> 00:53:26.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't want that
up-and-down motion so much.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:26.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:27.596 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Right.

00:53:27.596 --> 00:53:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:33.766 align:middle line:84%
>>GAINOR: And something I've
seen with young 20 somethings,

00:53:33.766 --> 00:53:35.890 align:middle line:84%
they get on the machine
and all of a sudden they're

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:37.880 align:middle line:90%
itchy and sore.

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.400 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.080 align:middle line:84%
They haven't done
anything for a long time.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Do it for two to three
minutes, once a day for a week,

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:45.700 align:middle line:90%
twice a day.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.666 align:middle line:90%
And get past that.

00:53:46.666 --> 00:53:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And move
those fluids around.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:49.670 align:middle line:90%
Well, we are out of time.

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:50.690 align:middle line:90%
This was so fun.

00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GAINOR: Thank you.

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I really appreciate
your coming and having

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.288 align:middle line:84%
the device brought
here for us too.

00:53:54.288 --> 00:53:56.007 align:middle line:84%
I know everybody
wants to get on it

00:53:56.007 --> 00:53:57.340 align:middle line:90%
now as soon as we go off camera.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.860 align:middle line:10%
