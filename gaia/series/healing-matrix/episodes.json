From the energy of geographic power spots upon lay lines to chakras and body positions, we explore how the geometry of the Earth and sacred architecture are connected with the movement and formations of subtle energies that influence health.","teaser":"What if the geometry that surrounds you influences your health and overall wellbeing?","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/84d15362-9802-4da5-a8c7-d0968974bc7b?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/794f34d1-ee81-4d31-9ca5-079bc69de638?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/794f34d1-ee81-4d31-9ca5-079bc69de638?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/794f34d1-ee81-4d31-9ca5-079bc69de638?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Ibrahim Karim, Doreya Karim"},{"seriesId":30037,"seriesTitle":"Healing Matrix","seriesPath":"series/healing-matrix","seriesVoteDownCount":402,"seriesVoteUpCount":2594,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/e8ca74e3-6ba8-4ad1-a885-88a7fa3f60eb?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2019-09-23","episode":7,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/e337aa18-6934-489a-ae74-ad6f9289844b?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/18e6d8d6-7fc8-4a2b-9883-11e1de92ad4f?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Sue Morter","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/biogeometry-part-2","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/e8ca74e3-6ba8-4ad1-a885-88a7fa3f60eb?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":3,"title":"BioGeometry Part 2","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26630","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Esoteric Healing","weight":0},{"content_id":"120196","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/energy-healing","name":"Energy Healing","weight":1},{"content_id":"207964","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/health-healing","name":"Health & Healing","weight":1},{"content_id":"120166","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/sacred-geometry","name":"Sacred Geometry","weight":1},{"content_id":"26649","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/interview","name":"Interview","weight":0},{"content_id":"122359","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/sue-morter","name":"Sue Morter","weight":0},{"content_id":"207734","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/1-health-healing-rc","name":"1 - Health & Healing RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"122190","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"alternative-healing","name":"Alternative Healing","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":9,"voteUpCount":338,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":98,"seasonCount":6,"preview":{"duration":120,"mediaId":183770,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":183770,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":3531,"mediaId":183774,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":183774,"isFree":false},"id":183820,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"With the increase in telecommunication technologies we are being increasingly inundated with potentially dangerous electromagnetic radiation.

It is a way that you can store moments of love, to help you during future moments of distress, to lighten your mood and improve your day.\r\n\r\nJulia Mossbridge, MA, PhD is  the founder and research director of Mossbridge Institute, LLC, as well as a Visiting Scholar in the Psychology Department  at Northwestern University, a Fellow at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, the Science Director at Focus@Will Labs, and an Associated Professor in Integral and Transpersonal Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies.","teaser":"Julia Mossbridge reveals time travel therapies, or temporaceuticals.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/4685bca8-6885-42aa-ae05-6b5355567b4c?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/8e786975-463a-4171-a274-366535f3b736?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/8e786975-463a-4171-a274-366535f3b736?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/8e786975-463a-4171-a274-366535f3b736?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Julia Mossbridge"},{"seriesId":30037,"seriesTitle":"Healing Matrix","seriesPath":"series/healing-matrix","seriesVoteDownCount":402,"seriesVoteUpCount":2594,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/636001cc-638d-43e7-b836-643225230c61?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","created":"2019-11-18","episode":15,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/810ee335-63f4-412e-ade7-349fdc89c68d?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/77056ec0-19f3-435a-ae23-4065bc6a97a4?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Sue Morter","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/healthy-happy-ayurveda","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/636001cc-638d-43e7-b836-643225230c61?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","published":true,"season":3,"title":"Healthy-Happy with Ayurveda","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26628","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Integrative Health","weight":0},{"content_id":"120221","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/ayurveda","name":"Ayurveda","weight":1},{"content_id":"207964","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/health-healing","name":"Health & Healing","weight":1},{"content_id":"26649","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/interview","name":"Interview","weight":0},{"content_id":"122359","content_type":"person","reference_type":"interview-host","language":"en","path":"person/sue-morter","name":"Sue Morter","weight":0},{"content_id":"207734","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/1-health-healing-rc","name":"1 - Health & Healing RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"122190","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"alternative-healing","name":"Alternative Healing","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":8,"voteUpCount":118,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":98,"seasonCount":6,"preview":{"duration":111,"mediaId":186944,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":186944,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":3310,"mediaId":186945,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":186945,"isFree":false},"id":186908,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"What if a medical doctor told you, that loving yourself may be the most important thing you can do to drastically improve your health?

Dr. Grube then explains how a root canal tooth is removed and the amazing improvements to health that thousands of her patients have experienced after the safe extraction.","teaser":"Dr. Blanche Grube discusses what a root canal is, why they are done, and the lasting consequences to the body as bacteria and toxins grow underneath the now dead tooth.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/68643791-1e8a-4189-92ce-554e17efe06b?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/19003bb2-61f5-4106-b8a9-3e9278e5d5c5?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/19003bb2-61f5-4106-b8a9-3e9278e5d5c5?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/19003bb2-61f5-4106-b8a9-3e9278e5d5c5?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Dr. Blanche Grube"},{"seriesId":30037,"seriesTitle":"Healing Matrix","seriesPath":"series/healing-matrix","seriesVoteDownCount":402,"seriesVoteUpCount":2594,"coverartImage":null,"created":"2020-10-29","episode":9,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":null,"heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/b3361c6b-eea1-4142-a5c5-b86093005b8d?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","host":"Dr. Ed Group","meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/oral-health-and-chronic-illness","previewImage":null,"published":true,"season":6,"title":"Oral Health and Chronic Illness","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"contentSubtype":"normal","references":[{"content_id":"26629","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"admin_category","language":"en","path":null,"name":"Alternative Health","weight":0},{"content_id":"207964","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"centers","language":"en","path":"topic/health-healing","name":"Health & Healing","weight":1},{"content_id":"26649","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"genres","language":"en","path":"genre/interview","name":"Interview","weight":0},{"content_id":"207734","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"rainbow-category","language":"en","path":"tag/1-health-healing-rc","name":"1 - Health & Healing RC","weight":0},{"content_id":"122190","content_type":"tag","reference_type":"site_segment","language":"en","path":"alternative-healing","name":"Alternative Healing","weight":1}],"voteDownCount":1,"voteUpCount":139,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":98,"seasonCount":6,"preview":{"duration":136,"mediaId":206121,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":206121,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":3110,"mediaId":206120,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":206120,"isFree":false},"id":202278,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Losing a tooth can be an arduous ordeal, but it is nothing compared to the health consequences if that tooth is not properly treated. Dr. Blanche Grube and Dr. Ed Group discuss cavitations and implants, which can result from a removed tooth, and both pose serious risks to the rest of the body. Dr. Grube explains that a cavitation, not properly addressed, creates a hole in the bone that doesn't heal where bacteria and toxins build up, which can lead to chronic illnesses. Problems with implants include the body rejecting them, the electrical fields they create that interfere with the way the brain works, and the implants’ effects on the organs in the body. As we wrap up this discussion on Biological Dentistry, we explore various misconceptions from modern dentistry and the things you can do to maintain oral health which affects your overall wellbeing.","teaser":"Dr. Blanche Grube and Dr. Ed Group discuss cavitations and implants, which can result from a removed tooth, and both pose serious risks to the rest of the body.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/0044c4d9-50d6-4cc2-9d4b-861c04e967c0?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/4e9fd8bb-0bae-4bf8-8789-03b0959ba011?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/4e9fd8bb-0bae-4bf8-8789-03b0959ba011?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/assets-render/4e9fd8bb-0bae-4bf8-8789-03b0959ba011?hash=c5309a93e9a10f0e6fac0e3003892d672eca39d63d823a5121f2d39cbdb665f4"},"cast":"Dr. Blanche Grube"}]
