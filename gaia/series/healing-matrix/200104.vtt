00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:28.740 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're one of the 90%
of Americans who have suffered

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:10%
from back pain, you know just
how frustrating it can be.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:84%
Healer Esther Gokhale believes
that back pain is largely

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.040 align:middle line:90%
the result of improper posture.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:84%
She's the founder of the Gokhale
Method, a revolutionary program

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.400 align:middle line:84%
that teaches people how
to use healthy posture

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.820 align:middle line:84%
and movement to restore
their structural integrity

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:90%
and banish pain.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Esther is the author
of bestseller "8 Steps

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.890 align:middle line:84%
to a Pain-Free Back," and
has been dubbed the posture

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.780 align:middle line:90%
guru of Silicon Valley.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
Esther, welcome
to Healing Matrix.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Delighted to be here.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, wonderful.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Just tell us a little bit
about your background.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.400 align:middle line:84%
How did you get interested
in healing in particular?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Healing because of my mother.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.620 align:middle line:84%
She was a registered
nurse from Holland.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:10%
Married my father, an Indian.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.380 align:middle line:10%
And while she was
in India, she took

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:10%
care of sick orphans,
abandoned babies,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:10%
nursed them back to health.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I saw some
pretty amazing things

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
happen, and was very
impressed and inspired

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
that unusual methods
could have an impact.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.240 align:middle line:10%
>> And did you have a particular
personal interest in back pain

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.040 align:middle line:10%
in particular?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I came to it the hard
way with my own very severe

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.930 align:middle line:10%
problems.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
I had a L5-S1 herniated
disc when I was

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:90%
pregnant with my first child.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying all
the usual conservative

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
and alternative approaches
and not getting anywhere.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, I
had to have surgery.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.140 align:middle line:84%
At that point, it was a huge
herniation and two fragments

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.420 align:middle line:90%
floating around in the canal.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.539 align:middle line:90%
And so that helped.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:84%
But then a year later, I
re-herniated the same disc.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that surgery hadn't
lasted as a result either.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I was forced to
cast my net wider and look

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
for something that
would help me.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
And then you traveled to
Paris and something unfolded.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The approaches that
resonated for me

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
were the ones that point
you to your own body

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and the way you're using it.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And that included Alexander
Technique, and Feldenkrais,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and Aplomb, which is
a French technique.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And I spent an
entire year in Paris

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and then several more
years in close association

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.970 align:middle line:90%
with the Aplomb teachers.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And they were pointing to
indigenous people and ancestral

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:90%
populations.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And that made sense to me.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.930 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up
in India, my mother

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
would always point out to the
sweeper and the fruit seller

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
and point out how amazing
they were in the way they

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.690 align:middle line:90%
used their bodies.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.200 align:middle line:84%
So anything that was
pointing to indigenous,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
primal ways of using
your own body resonated.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I was diving into
the medical literature

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.930 align:middle line:84%
to see if indeed there
were populations that had

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.550 align:middle line:90%
lower incidence of back pain.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I started traveling
and filming and photographing

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:84%
things I observed, interviewing
people, and discovering

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.830 align:middle line:84%
that it really is
true that there

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
are populations that have a much
lower incidence of back pain.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.770 align:middle line:84%
And they sit differently, walk
differently, bend differently,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.040 align:middle line:84%
even lie down differently
than we in the modern west do.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> We have video of Esther
in Burkina Faso, Africa.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Esther, tell us about
what we're seeing here.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So I am mimicking
this group of women,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.780 align:middle line:84%
who are walking with
weight on their heads.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things to observe
is how they use their glutes

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:10%
to propel themselves forward.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Every step is a rep for their
gluteus maximus and gluteus

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:90%
medius muscles.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
You see how their behinds
are out behind them?

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that mimicking people

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
who know what they're doing is
a particularly fantastic way

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.940 align:middle line:90%
of learning posture.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
we're copying what's

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:84%
around us, which is not
such wonderful posture.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.640 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Most people today
slump and slouch.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And we, whether we like it or
not, whether we know it or not,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:90%
are copying what's around.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.670 align:middle line:84%
So having examples
of good posture

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:90%
is just extremely helpful.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> What were some of the
most profound observations

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.510 align:middle line:84%
and conclusions that you've
drawn from your worldwide

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.026 align:middle line:90%
research?

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:14.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one is that the
basic shape of the spine

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.830 align:middle line:84%
in populations where they don't
have so much back pain and hip

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
arthritis and plantar fasciitis
and a host of musculoskeletal

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
problems is that they have what
I call a J spine rather than

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
an S spine, which is what
conventional wisdom describes

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:90%
as normal for our species.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
So the J is like a modern
J. Its like a hockey stick,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:84%
where the behind is
distinctly behind.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And then up above,
you don't have so much

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.010 align:middle line:84%
of what's considered
a normal lumbar curve.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.560 align:middle line:84%
That portion of the
back in these people

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
is relatively
straight up and down.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.650 align:middle line:90%
So J spine rather than S spine.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And that is preserved
in sitting, in standing,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.010 align:middle line:90%
in walking.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And it has a host
of implications.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.420 align:middle line:84%
If your behind is behind, then
the glutes are in a position

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.130 align:middle line:84%
to work, as we saw
in the video clip.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle line:84%
The glutes can propel the person
forward and tone themselves,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
so now there's not the
need to go to a gym

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.310 align:middle line:84%
and do all of these reps and
push weights around and so on.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
These people are
exercising all day long.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people also say that
our sedentary lifestyle,

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.370 align:middle line:84%
becoming computerized and
sitting down and all this,

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:90%
is a contributor to back pain.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.252 align:middle line:90%
What's your take on that?

00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:50.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think sitting
has been much maligned.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.495 align:middle line:84%
If you go back a few decades,
standing was the bad guy.

00:06:53.495 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, people in assembly
lines getting varicose veins.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's still true.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:84%
People who stand all day
have an increased risk

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.580 align:middle line:90%
of atherosclerosis.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Your fine motor
skills are less good.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
kinds of focused

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:84%
thinking that don't happen
as well when you're standing.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
downside to standing.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.100 align:middle line:90%
We used to be aware of it.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:90%
Now the fashions have changed.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.052 align:middle line:90%
Sitting's the bad guy.

00:07:18.052 --> 00:07:19.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think either
is reasonable.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It's always something, right?

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it makes
for good headlines.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Sitting is the new smoking.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you really examine
the data, people who sit

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
do better than
people who are doing

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.170 align:middle line:90%
manual labor in our society.

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.270 align:middle line:84%
You have to earn
your living some way.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is that sitting
seems to actually protect you

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:90%
from worse stuff happening.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.670 align:middle line:84%
So it's not really
fair to blame sitting.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we all
do pretty badly.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at these
non-industrial cultures,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.120 align:middle line:84%
they do well and they
are actually sitting

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.075 align:middle line:90%
just about as much as we do.

00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
What about obesity,
stress, one's height,

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.230 align:middle line:84%
those kinds of issues that
also we commonly hear people

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.330 align:middle line:84%
say, well, of course
I've got this bad back.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.832 align:middle line:84%
I'm this tall and I'm
always trying to--

00:08:11.832 --> 00:08:13.040 align:middle line:90%
you know, this kind of thing?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So I look at it a little bit
like you look at construction.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
If you have a
skyscraper, you know,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.470 align:middle line:84%
a little bit taller, if it's
well aligned, is not a problem.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.400 align:middle line:84%
If it's a little broader,
and it's well aligned,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:90%
not a problem.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's similar
with human beings.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
If we were well aligned, there's
not a very strong correlation

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:90%
with weight and height.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you are poorly
aligned, then every inch

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:84%
counts against you and every
ounce counts against you.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it's
the combination

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.100 align:middle line:84%
of poor structure, poor
musculoskeletal health,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:90%
and these other factors.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.545 align:middle line:84%
Then everything
counts against you.

00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:56.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, the
question is going to come up.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
What about aging and
natural wear and tear?

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, am I supposed to be
in pain because I'm in my 70s?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, what's
the story there?

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.265 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think we're designed
to last well for our natural

00:09:09.265 --> 00:09:10.065 align:middle line:90%
lives.

00:09:10.065 --> 00:09:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Lifetime guarantee we're
supposed to have on this body,

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.940 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:90%
It should last a lifetime.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> But the problem is, we don't
arrive with the user's manual.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.970 align:middle line:84%
And then that causes increasing
wear and tear and degeneration.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And then like height and weight,
age becomes a problem, too.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
So in our courses, we have
seen 100-year-olds, babies,

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.080 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can always help people
improve their structure.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And people are usually
very astonished at how much

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:84%
of an effect that has on
their pains and aches.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Aches and pains are
like nature trying

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.950 align:middle line:84%
to tell you, hey, do
something different.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:54.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Pay attention here.

00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to get
your attention.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take a
look at this image.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.216 align:middle line:84%
If you could explain to
us what we're seeing here.

00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:06.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're seeing an
old-fashioned French magazine

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.040 align:middle line:90%
cover.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is pre-World
War I. And you

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:19.060 align:middle line:84%
see how the back of the
neck is very elongated,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:84%
the chin angles down
in the woman standing?

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And her shoulders
are open and broad.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:29.560 align:middle line:84%
This is what is
truly good posture.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:84%
It's stylized, there's
some clothes around it.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.275 align:middle line:84%
But this is what I consider
old-fashioned good posture.

00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's an enlongation
in the cervical spine.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.442 align:middle line:90%
>> In the neck, in the back.

00:10:40.442 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:90%
And then the behind's behind.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.285 align:middle line:90%
A J spine again.

00:10:43.285 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> So the J spine.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.720 align:middle line:90%
So this is what it looks like.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And then an alternative posture
that we've gotten into trouble

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.940 align:middle line:90%
with after World War--

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I, roughly.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you speak to us
about what we're seeing here?

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So you see in this
French magazine cover,

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:90%
the newer fashion.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.510 align:middle line:84%
You see how the
pelvis is tucked,

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.510 align:middle line:84%
how the neck
extends forward, how

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
the shoulders are
protruding, and the chest

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.160 align:middle line:90%
becomes much more flat.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole different
way of being in the body.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And this has been our
fashion ever since.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is what remains
cool on the runways today.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:35.802 align:middle line:84%
And it's very different
and much less healthy.

00:11:35.802 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
>> As we are seeing these images
and you're describing this S

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:84%
and J relationship, can you just
again share with us the J curve

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and how someone can know
if they are in it or not,

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and as it relates to
what we're seeing here?

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:10%
>> On the left, you have
the classic S-shaped spine,

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:10%
the S spine that you find
in every modern anatomy book

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.340 align:middle line:10%
and chiropractic chart.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:13.450 align:middle line:10%
And it is the basis for lumbar
support, lumbar pillows,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:10%
every car seat
having lumbar support

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:10%
to fit what is thought to
be a natural sort of curve

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:10%
in the small of the back.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.590 align:middle line:10%
On the right, you have
a picture of the spine

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.050 align:middle line:10%
from an anatomy book
published in 1911.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:10%
And it shows what I'm
calling the J spine.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:10%
And you see how the behind
is very much behind.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.890 align:middle line:10%
But right above the behind,
you see that the lumbar spine

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:10%
is relatively straight.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:10%
And I'm arguing that that
makes a whole lot more sense

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.770 align:middle line:10%
and it correlates
with back health.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And there are radiologic
studies demonstrating that.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can use
common-sensical arguments

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:84%
because in that J spine, all
the discs' cylindrical shape

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:90%
is respected.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.500 align:middle line:10%
And the vertebrae are
not edgewise compressed.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:10%
And the wedge shape
of the L5-S1 disc,

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.080 align:middle line:10%
the very lowest
disc in our spine,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:34.240 align:middle line:10%
that adapted to becoming
wedge-shaped as part

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.310 align:middle line:10%
of being bipedal.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And that wedge
shape is respected.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.500 align:middle line:90%
So you have the behind behind.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:84%
And that just makes a whole
lot more sense in so many ways.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very interesting for
us to be bringing this forth,

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.880 align:middle line:84%
and we've been through so
many changes through this time

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.297 align:middle line:84%
period that you're
speaking about.

00:13:56.297 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:84%
I can see the correlation about
what might be happening here.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And you have something
super exciting to share

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
with us that is a tool that
allows us to monitor what

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.790 align:middle line:84%
the spine is doing in
real time, that can even

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:84%
act as a biofeedback
type of teacher

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.180 align:middle line:84%
for us to see how we're
orienting ourselves

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.060 align:middle line:84%
inside the body and
utilizing our spine.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us a little
bit about this spine tracker

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.400 align:middle line:90%
that you have with us today?

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So this consists of
five sensors that get stuck

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:90%
to the spine.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So this is something we've
invented over the last five

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.470 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.900 align:middle line:84%
I have one on my back and
would be happy to demo it.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> It is stuck to my
spine, so there it is.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.030 align:middle line:90%
>> With the lowest one--

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.575 align:middle line:90%
>> So these electrode--

00:14:46.575 --> 00:14:47.375 align:middle line:90%
>> --on my--

00:14:47.375 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> --type things.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> --sacrum.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:55.670 align:middle line:84%
So the sensors are talking
to our app in real time.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:01.570 align:middle line:84%
So it gives a real time read
of the shape of my spine.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And what I can do with
this is mark a target.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:10%
So I consider this a
good seated position,

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to mark
that as a target.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.128 align:middle line:84%
And now when a student
comes back to their position

00:15:19.128 --> 00:15:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and they are sitting some
different way, they can tell,

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
oops.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:23.480 align:middle line:90%
That's not exactly--

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.380 align:middle line:90%
>> A sway back.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> A sway.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Or if their tucking
their pelvis and slouching--

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, pelvis -- they see it.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.285 align:middle line:90%
>> --too much.

00:15:28.285 --> 00:15:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:10%
>> And then they learn
what it is they need to do

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.560 align:middle line:10%
in their body to
match the target.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And with some students
we like to make it even more

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:90%
colorful.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.360 align:middle line:84%
So we have a
simulation of what's

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
going on on the
inside of their body,

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:84%
so they can see that when
they sway that it actually

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.437 align:middle line:90%
loads their discs.

00:15:48.437 --> 00:15:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>> And compressing--

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.400 align:middle line:84%
>> And if they slump, then it
loads the discs differently.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So they take home in
a very visceral way--

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>> --why it is that they need
to pay attention to this--

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.720 align:middle line:84%
>> --to the shape
of their spine.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.130 align:middle line:84%
That there are actually
nuts and bolts in there--

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --that merit some attention.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Need to be used properly.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And then gives them
practice in matching targets

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.270 align:middle line:84%
for sitting, for
standing, for bending.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So this has been
very useful for us

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:84%
for helping students learn
more efficiently and also

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:26.870 align:middle line:90%
for doing research.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Raising consciousness
in the biomechanics.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is inside the
classroom where you teach,

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.120 align:middle line:84%
where you're training people
how to do exactly what we're

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:90%
talking about.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So most of our teachers
use this as part of their way

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.930 align:middle line:84%
of helping students understand,
learn what they need to do.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And then we also track
all the snapshots

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.370 align:middle line:84%
on the student's records
so that they can see what

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.380 align:middle line:90%
their progress is over time.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So what do you think about the
conventional recommendations

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:90%
for back problems?

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.579 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, it's not
this, but other things.

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:09.329 align:middle line:84%
Examples, surgery, medicating,
rehabilitation in other ways.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:10.670 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about--

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, sometimes like what
every parent tells their kids,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:84%
sit up straight, is
just plain wrong.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:90%
It's misguided.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Many, many of the interventions
out there are helpful,

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:90%
but they deal with symptoms.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a hack,
it's a Band-Aid.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Without understanding what's
at the root of the problem,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
we can make the pain
disappear by doing pain meds

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:90%
or by injecting or--

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.040 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's really
important at some stage

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:84%
in the game to address
the root of the problem.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:84%
The reason we have pain, that's
nature's way of saying, hey.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:90%
Something's not quite right.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.970 align:middle line:84%
And then we need to not
just kill the messenger

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.470 align:middle line:90%
or ignore the messenger.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
We need to understand the
messenger, do the necessary,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
and move forward.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
What do you think about
the standard advice

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.145 align:middle line:84%
that most physicians would
give us about staying active?

00:18:07.145 --> 00:18:09.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to stay active,
or in other situations

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.575 align:middle line:84%
to completely lay in
bed until this heals.

00:18:12.575 --> 00:18:13.950 align:middle line:84%
What-- how do you
work with that?

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.283 align:middle line:90%
How do you make those decisions?

00:18:15.283 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> So laying in
bed is old school.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.300 align:middle line:90%
That's no longer recommended.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's a good thing,
because it turns out

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.050 align:middle line:90%
that's not very helpful.

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Staying active, I think,
is a good piece of advice,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.066 align:middle line:84%
but it could be
done so much better.

00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you have to
do what your body allows.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to tune
in, and sometimes

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.710 align:middle line:84%
less active,
sometimes more active.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:84%
But a key thing
that's missing is

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:90%
how are you going to be active?

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.920 align:middle line:90%
What is the shape of your spine?

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
What are your body mechanics
as you go about being active?

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's key,
because we all know

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
injured themselves

00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.350 align:middle line:84%
while being active in sports
or just tying their shoelaces.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:06.830 align:middle line:84%
So just saying be active without
any further specifications,

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:10.530 align:middle line:84%
we know, doesn't always
land a good result.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.980 align:middle line:84%
But active plus with
good posture is fabulous.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:84%
The right kind of
active goes a long way.

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So what is your relationship
with other modalities,

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.680 align:middle line:84%
other disciplines,
chiropractic, acupuncture,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:90%
physical therapists, et cetera.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.310 align:middle line:90%
What-- osteopathy.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.860 align:middle line:90%
What is the interaction there?

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think collaboration
works particularly well,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.110 align:middle line:84%
because these are highly skilled
people who have been trained

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
for years and can do wonders
for inflammations or all sorts

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.610 align:middle line:84%
There's a missing
piece, which is what

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.360 align:middle line:90%
we try to bring to the table.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Which is like after you've had
your adjustment or your surgery

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.190 align:middle line:84%
or your injection, what are
you doing when you go home?

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.060 align:middle line:90%
How are you bending?

00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.970 align:middle line:90%
How are you sitting?

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.690 align:middle line:84%
So we help people do
their part, and that

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
makes all of these
other interventions

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
so much more effective,
holds so much better.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:10.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Sustainable--

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.005 align:middle line:90%
>> --and integrative.

00:20:12.005 --> 00:20:16.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I think collaboration
is the right way to go.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
The people who have
been the most receptive

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
have been the primary care
physicians, because they

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.570 align:middle line:84%
are the ones who are facing
complaining patients who

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.570 align:middle line:84%
have back problems, get
sent someplace, come back

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:90%
with the same problem.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know from the research
and we know from our--

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:84%
most people's experience
that most things

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:84%
don't work very well or
they don't hold very well.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.727 align:middle line:84%
People keep coming back
with the same problems.

00:20:41.727 --> 00:20:42.810 align:middle line:90%
And so they appreciate it.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And the standard primary care
physician wasn't really trained

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.000 align:middle line:84%
in biomechanics and
prevention and--

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:47.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.580 align:middle line:90%
>> --those kinds of things.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>> So there is no turf--

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:84%
>> They're a totally
different discipline.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're thrilled
to have you on the scene,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.830 align:middle line:90%
showing everyone what to do--

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> --instead of some of the
other more dramatic modalities

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.170 align:middle line:84%
that would have to get suggested
in these circumstances.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.470 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel about lumbar
support, cervical pillows,

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.830 align:middle line:84%
these kinds of supports as
people are sitting or sleeping,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:11.740 align:middle line:90%
et cetera?

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So, again, it depends what
sort of philosophy they are

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.580 align:middle line:90%
informed by.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a lumbar
support pillow,

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
trying to create extra
lumbar curve where I think it

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:84%
should be more
lengthened and flat,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.380 align:middle line:90%
and then I'm not so thrilled.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
We have created our own
props to help people

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:90%
undo some of the extra curves.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And so in the cervical
area, we actually

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:41.600 align:middle line:84%
like the neck to be taller
and straighter rather than

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.190 align:middle line:90%
extra curve.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
Now if you already have a
curve, it's nice to support--

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.800 align:middle line:84%
acknowledge what's going
on and support the neck

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:90%
as you steadily improve it.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:84%
For the lumber area, we
have a Stretchsit cushion,

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.320 align:middle line:84%
which I will be
demonstrating to you later,

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.130 align:middle line:84%
that reduces lumbar curve
rather than increases it.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And so this is the aid
that you do recommend.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think aids can
be really helpful,

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.250 align:middle line:84%
but they just need
to be well-informed.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.150 align:middle line:84%
They need to have the right
philosophy guiding them

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:18.290 align:middle line:90%
and not be counterproductive.

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:21.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you show us how the
Stretchsit cushion works?

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:22.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd be delighted.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:23.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:90%
Show us what's happening here.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So the chair, as you can
see, has these sticky nubs,

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.880 align:middle line:90%
and that offers friction.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is that
the person sitting

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.060 align:middle line:84%
would lengthen their spine,
hook up against the cushion,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:84%
and then be a little taller
And basically have traction.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:44.830 align:middle line:90%
And I'll demo.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So we teach people to put their
bum well back in the chair,

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and then come away
from the sticky nubs

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.780 align:middle line:90%
and then elongate their spine.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.650 align:middle line:84%
First by curving
forward and that

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:84%
undoes whatever extra
lumbar curve they have.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And then grabbing either
the pillow or some part

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
of the chair to make
the back even taller.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.490 align:middle line:84%
And then hooking the
back to the sticky nubs.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:84%
And now the back
is getting a boost

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
whereas previously the back
was just short and compressed

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and getting all kinds
of wear and tear.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's extremely
helpful way to make

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
sitting not only more
comfortable, but also more

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.940 align:middle line:90%
therapeutic.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So rather than the
compressive forces,

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:84%
you're actually tractioning
as you're seated.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:37.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:37.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So beautiful combination.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
So informative, traction
while you're sitting, amazing.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.990 align:middle line:84%
It brings to mind something
that many people also

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.220 align:middle line:90%
have feet issues.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes,
traction helps that.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:84%
It makes me think
about, is there

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.440 align:middle line:84%
something that you can share
with us about the biomechanics

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.540 align:middle line:84%
related to the spine and posture
and how it translates down

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.765 align:middle line:90%
to the issue of foot pain?

00:24:03.765 --> 00:24:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Like the ditty goes, the
foot bone's connected to the leg

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.120 align:middle line:84%
bone, and the leg bone's
connected to-- so yes.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm definitely in the camp
of everything is connected--

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:90%
>> You bet.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> --very literally.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.310 align:middle line:84%
In particular, the
way most people

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:23.170 align:middle line:84%
stand, they park their hips
forward and put a lot of weight

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.360 align:middle line:90%
on the front of the foot.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is easy on all the leg
muscles which get to turn off.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:36.880 align:middle line:84%
But every joint,
knee, hip, spine,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:84%
is put under stress in
this way and in the foot.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So that, as well
as the way people

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.800 align:middle line:84%
walk where they tend to lift
their heel way too early,

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:52.090 align:middle line:84%
puts a lot of stress on
the front of the foot

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and leads to things
like plantar fasciitis

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:90%
and Morton's neuroma and all--

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:84%
bunions and all sorts
of common ailments

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.150 align:middle line:84%
that there really isn't
a very good way around.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.430 align:middle line:84%
Once your foot is in
trouble, now what do you do?

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
I've had people crawl into
my office in desperation.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're recommending longer
on the heel before the heel

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.340 align:middle line:90%
lift--

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> --as they're moving into
the heel strike in front, yes?

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So the heel, as you know
in our species, is huge.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:27.910 align:middle line:90%
It's dense.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:90%
It has cross fiber construction.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.960 align:middle line:90%
It is made for weight bearing.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:31.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And leaving the weight
there, both in standing as well

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.350 align:middle line:84%
as in a prolonged way in
walking, makes a lot of sense.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way that these
indigenous people walk.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, is
always the bottom line.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:84%
It also allows the foot to then
do normal human foot things,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:90%
like grab the ground.

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And in that process, get its
exercise and its therapy.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're self
exercising, self-healing.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And so much happens there with
lymphatic pumping and allowing

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:09.485 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of fluids to become
mobilized and healthy tissues.

00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:13.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
piece of our humanity

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that gets certainly ruled
out in our culture so much.

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.280 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us about the
Gokhale Method specifically,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.420 align:middle line:84%
how it's laid out in the book
and what a reader might be

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.940 align:middle line:90%
able to anticipate and dive in.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:33.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a step-by-step series
of instructions on how to sit,

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.660 align:middle line:84%
stand, lie down,
bend, walk, lift.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.770 align:middle line:84%
But it starts with
how I think is

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the safest and
best way to start,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.160 align:middle line:90%
which is elongate the spine.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.140 align:middle line:90%
So it's like preparing the clay.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So I like people to begin
with stretch sitting.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.300 align:middle line:84%
There's no downside
if it's done gently.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And then people are encouraged,
because they feel relief

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.200 align:middle line:90%
right away.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Stretch lying on the back is one
of these other techniques that

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.350 align:middle line:84%
is easy, lot of
bang for the buck,

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.830 align:middle line:84%
and now people feel energized
to invest a little more effort

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:84%
in the other techniques,
which take a little bit more

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.810 align:middle line:90%
than a few seconds of learning.

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:84%
>> But it teaches
them how to do that?

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.580 align:middle line:90%
It teaches people step-by-step.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.890 align:middle line:84%
The best way is
always to get a coach.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it is a
kinesthetic thing.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.620 align:middle line:84%
It's like learning to
play golf or tennis.

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And having a coach
tell you that, no, you

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:38.280 align:middle line:84%
don't look like a gorilla,
and take a picture of you

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.270 align:middle line:90%
and show you that.

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:42.090 align:middle line:84%
You may feel like
you're leaning forward

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's so different from
what you were doing previously,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
which was arching back, but
it looks perfectly wonderful.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And so having a coach encourage
you and guide you to the result

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.200 align:middle line:90%
is the best way.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And now I have trained over 50
teachers all around the world,

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and they're able to provide
this hands on guidance.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But the book is a really
good starting point,

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.400 align:middle line:90%
It gives a overview.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.720 align:middle line:90%
It makes sense.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.390 align:middle line:84%
People feel encouraged,
and it starts people

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.970 align:middle line:84%
on the journey with
these easy techniques,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.790 align:middle line:84%
like stretch sitting
and stretch lying.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you share with
our viewers that you feel are

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the most important initial
techniques of the Gokhale

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:90%
Method?

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I think stretch lying is a
really good one as with stretch

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.450 align:middle line:90%
sitting.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.740 align:middle line:84%
And squeezing the
glutes with every step

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:84%
can also be very
safe and effective

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.520 align:middle line:84%
and helps balance
and things like that.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Esther has already shown
us how to stretch sit.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Another of the key exercises,
as she's just mentioning,

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.680 align:middle line:90%
is stretch lying.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have a video of
her demonstrating it here.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we're going to learn
another simple technique called

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.070 align:middle line:90%
stretch lying.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Stretch lying will make
you sleep more comfortably.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Begin by bending your
knees and placing your feet

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.150 align:middle line:90%
hip width apart on the bed.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Prop your upper body
onto your elbows,

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and now dig your elbows in
and push towards your feet,

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.060 align:middle line:90%
putting one vertebra down.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.340 align:middle line:84%
Now you don't want to
jut out your rib cage.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
You want to put one
vertebra down at a time

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:90%
and uncurl onto the bed.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.010 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Now you bring your
hands behind your neck

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and elongate the
back of your neck.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And you want to not jut
the chin up, but rather

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:84%
leave the neck elongated
and the chin down.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And then move your
hands out of the way.

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And keeping the traction that
you've created in your back,

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:84%
you are going to slide
your shoulders down

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.870 align:middle line:90%
towards your feet.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Now straighten out
the knees and let

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:03.980 align:middle line:84%
the knees slightly externally
rotate and lay on the pillow.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:04.780 align:middle line:90%
Looks good.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Lucy, if you can bring the
pillow under your shoulders,

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:11.030 align:middle line:84%
that would be
better because that

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:84%
helps you curve
your ribcage forward

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.630 align:middle line:90%
and elongate your low back.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Do this for only five
minutes of the night,

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.940 align:middle line:84%
but you may be surprised
that you stay there

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.270 align:middle line:84%
for a longer period because
your body is so comfortable.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Many people tell me they
wake up in the same position

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.097 align:middle line:84%
that they went to sleep
in, and they're shocked.

00:30:31.097 --> 00:30:33.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Who'd have thought we have
to be instructed so much on just

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.730 align:middle line:90%
how to lay?

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.740 align:middle line:84%
But obviously it's
making a big difference.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
most dramatic cases

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:43.460 align:middle line:84%
of healing that you have
seen with your method?

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So many.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of a
retired psychiatrist who

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.450 align:middle line:84%
was one of the few people
who came in where I didn't

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.880 align:middle line:84%
see very much hope,
because things

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.760 align:middle line:90%
had gone so far south with him.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:05.330 align:middle line:84%
He was on pain meds and barely
able to go through the day.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:09.110 align:middle line:84%
And within just a
couple of sessions,

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:11.960 align:middle line:84%
he had quit taking
his pain meds.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
He continued working with
me, now doing dance lessons.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.130 align:middle line:90%
It was very dramatic.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And he then invited me
to his 90th birthday

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:25.700 align:middle line:84%
where he wanted me to teach
all his guests how to Samba.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:29.840 align:middle line:84%
So he went from being
in really bad trouble

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:37.090 align:middle line:84%
to having a very nice last
seven years of his life.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.220 align:middle line:90%
And there are so many.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.290 align:middle line:90%
Joan Baez is an example.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:84%
She recently gives the
Gokhale Method credit

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:49.660 align:middle line:84%
for being able to tour at
age 78 all around the world,

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and that's very gratifying.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:84%
She is really remarkable
in her physicality,

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:02.995 align:middle line:84%
and to be given credit
for that, it was very--

00:32:02.995 --> 00:32:04.370 align:middle line:84%
>> That's so
rewarding, isn't it?

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.170 align:middle line:90%
>> --rewarding.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You're making a
difference in people's lives.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Esther has countless
testimonials

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.180 align:middle line:84%
of people who have gone
through her course.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.730 align:middle line:84%
Here's what one client, an
internal medicine doctor,

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.800 align:middle line:90%
had to say.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.320 align:middle line:10%
>>JESSICA DAVIDSON: Before I
took the class with Esther,

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.350 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't able to
sit on the floor

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:25.960 align:middle line:10%
to play with my new
baby for even a minute.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.710 align:middle line:10%
And that was what prompted
me to take Esther's class.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.190 align:middle line:10%
I would get low back pain
anytime I sat on the floor.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:36.510 align:middle line:10%
I tend to be a big skeptic
about alternative medicine,

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:38.070 align:middle line:10%
and I don't think
I would have taken

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:42.990 align:middle line:10%
the course if Esther hadn't
described it so compellingly.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:10%
The benefits from
taking Esther's course

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:50.010 align:middle line:10%
were immediate and
felt miraculous to me.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:54.990 align:middle line:10%
I think I started feeling
it from the first class.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:59.220 align:middle line:10%
And I was able, shortly
after starting the class,

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:03.150 align:middle line:10%
to sit on the floor, and then
I've been able since then

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:10%
to sit on the floor, essentially
for as long as I want.

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.940 align:middle line:10%
If I had to give
you three adjectives

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.210 align:middle line:10%
to describe this
work, I would say

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:10%
miraculous has to be one,
because you just can't believe

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.840 align:middle line:10%
how much difference it makes.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.620 align:middle line:10%
Natural is another
one, because it just

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.730 align:middle line:10%
seems the natural way
for the human body to be.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:29.200 align:middle line:10%
And easy.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.320 align:middle line:90%
It's easy to do this.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the Gokhale Method
trainers who has facilitated

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.780 align:middle line:84%
some of these remarkable
transformations is actually

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.110 align:middle line:84%
Esther's daughter, Monisha,
and she's joining us here.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Monisha.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.212 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful to have you here.

00:33:43.212 --> 00:33:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have to tell
us, what was it

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
like growing up with
the posture guru?

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What it means is that healthy
posture actually came naturally

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.790 align:middle line:90%
to me.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:55.590 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a way that meant
that healthy posture habits

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.910 align:middle line:90%
were part of my everyday life.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:01.140 align:middle line:10%
The way she carried me,
the way she adjusted me,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.620 align:middle line:10%
all led to me approaching
sitting and standing

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.270 align:middle line:10%
and bending and
lying in ways that

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.060 align:middle line:10%
are actually healthy for
my structural integrity.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
think that growing up

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.989 align:middle line:84%
with a posture
teacher as a mother

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:14.730 align:middle line:84%
might be unpleasant,
because people's

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:84%
ideas of healthy posture is
some tense, unpleasant position.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.820 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, most of
posture is relaxed.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And healthy posture
is comfortable.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have good
posture at birth?

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I think--

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I think all babies
are actually born

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:36.150 align:middle line:90%
with natural, healthy alignment.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.969 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
role of the parent

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:42.580 align:middle line:84%
is to help maintain those
natural posture habits.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I think all babies are
born with natural alignment.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.730 align:middle line:84%
And the way Esther
carried me and sat me up

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and held me helped me
maintain a healthy posture

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.400 align:middle line:90%
habits into my adult life.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So how did your education
on correct posture do you--

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.850 align:middle line:84%
how do you feel that it
improved your life experience

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.650 align:middle line:90%
along the way?

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the impacts of
having healthy posture habits

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is my expectations on my
musculoskeletal health as I

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:90%
age.

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Many people in our culture
see how common back pain

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.990 align:middle line:84%
is and expect that they're going
to have back pain at some point

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.520 align:middle line:90%
if they haven't already.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of
confidence in sitting

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and standing and
bending and being active

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.000 align:middle line:84%
while maintaining
structural integrity,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and so I don't expect
to have back pain.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I never have had back issues or
major chronic musculoskeletal

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.040 align:middle line:84%
issues, and I don't expect
to develop those as I age.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:84%
Another really
important thing for me

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.248 align:middle line:84%
is its impact on my
life as an athlete.

00:35:42.248 --> 00:35:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Being an athlete is
really important to me.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.170 align:middle line:90%
It's a big part of who I am.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:51.510 align:middle line:10%
And having healthy posture
has, one, improved performance.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Good form and good posture
is a really big piece

00:35:54.780 --> 00:36:00.480 align:middle line:84%
of being an effective athlete,
and also on injury prevention

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.980 align:middle line:84%
as well as when injuries
do happen, injury recovery.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So how and when did you
decide to become involved with

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.130 align:middle line:90%
the Gokhale Method?

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Informally, I would say I've
been involved since before I

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.120 align:middle line:90%
was born and since birth.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:16.920 align:middle line:90%
But formally--

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.410 align:middle line:84%
>> It's kind of a
no-choice choice?

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I've been raised
in a way that means

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.990 align:middle line:84%
that I've been implementing a
lot of healthy posture habits

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:28.410 align:middle line:84%
even before I knew
formally or in an educated

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.050 align:middle line:90%
way what healthy posture meant.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But I did in some point
take our foundation's course

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.290 align:middle line:84%
and learn in a
formal way what it

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.560 align:middle line:84%
meant to have healthy
posture habits

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and healthy
structural integrity.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
And then went on to train
to be a Gokhale Method

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.280 align:middle line:90%
teacher about eight years ago.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.220 align:middle line:90%
And ever since, I've been--

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:56.100 align:middle line:84%
I started teaching alongside
my studying at Stanford.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.490 align:middle line:90%
I was a computer science major.

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And in summer as
an in-between, I

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.080 align:middle line:84%
did a little bit of
teaching on the side.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And two years ago, I
formally joined full time.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:08.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Esther, in what other ways
do people benefit from improving

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.880 align:middle line:90%
their posture?

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they improve all of
their joints and muscle health.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:20.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the nuts and bolts
of the obvious ways.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.490 align:middle line:84%
But they also report that
they're sleeping better,

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.780 align:middle line:90%
that they breathe better.

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Their digestion improves
because their organs now

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.700 align:middle line:84%
have more room, better
orientation, better blood

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.730 align:middle line:90%
supply, better nerve supply.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.750 align:middle line:84%
So they get results that
they weren't expecting.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
whole psychological piece

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.740 align:middle line:90%
that people feel more confident.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Other people are responding
to them differently.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole layered
series of benefits.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And is there data supporting
the work that you're doing?

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've done
in-house studies,

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and we expected the result that
people are improving pretty

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.600 align:middle line:84%
dramatically from the beginning
to the end of the course.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Our study followed
these students one month

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.200 align:middle line:90%
beyond the course.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't sure if they would
forget more or integrate more,

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.590 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out
they keep improving.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So integrating is more important
than forgetting, it turns out.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a crowdsourcing website
called healthoutcome.org,

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.710 align:middle line:84%
and we are the number
one rated intervention

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.390 align:middle line:90%
for lower back pain.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is a matter of
great satisfaction and pride,

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.090 align:middle line:90%
because this is not our website.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:49.410 align:middle line:10%
This is a third party website,
having nothing to do with us,

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:52.830 align:middle line:10%
and actually teaching
something competitive.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:56.610 align:middle line:10%
And we just rate
head and shoulders

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.290 align:middle line:10%
above everything else, so
that was delightful to see.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And now there are an increasing
number of research studies

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:84%
cropping up, so in
the next year or two

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.800 align:middle line:84%
we expect to be able to report
on randomized controlled trials

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.950 align:middle line:84%
and several other
research efforts.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.650 align:middle line:84%
So where can people go to
learn more about your program?

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:27.735 align:middle line:84%
>> The website is our
hub, gokhalemethod.com.

00:39:27.735 --> 00:39:33.330 align:middle line:10%
Spelled funny,
G-O-K-H-A-L-E Method.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's where all of
our teacher's offerings

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.170 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world are listed.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.290 align:middle line:90%
So we have 50 teachers.

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Many of them travel.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.200 align:middle line:84%
If people would like one of
our teachers to travel to them,

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.440 align:middle line:84%
that's also possible when
we have enough demand.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm currently on tour
teaching our one day

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.770 align:middle line:84%
pop up course all
over the country.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Either students come
to one of our hubs,

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:03.300 align:middle line:84%
or we travel to
groups of students.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we're
spreading the word.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.610 align:middle line:84%
But they can also learn
a lot from the book

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and from the free online
workshops that we offer

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.090 align:middle line:90%
and from the numerous resources.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.600 align:middle line:84%
And some people choose to start
with the Stretchsit cushion,

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.150 align:middle line:84%
or we have a chair
that we've designed.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:25.050 align:middle line:84%
And those can be very
easy access points,

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:29.740 align:middle line:84%
not so much learning
immediate benefit.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And so for some people
that suits best.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how they start.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.345 align:middle line:84%
We just encourage
people to do something--

00:40:36.345 --> 00:40:37.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Just begin.

00:40:37.145 --> 00:40:38.640 align:middle line:90%
>> --take the first baby step.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, wonderful.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much to both
of you for being here,

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and thank you for bringing
forth a solution for us

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.100 align:middle line:84%
