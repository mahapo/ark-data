>>SUE MORTER: Ayurveda is
one of the oldest healing

disciplines in the world.

It aims at bringing the body
back into balance with nature

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.780 align:middle line:10%
by living in sync with
its circadian rhythms,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.500 align:middle line:10%
restoring digestive and,
particularly, lymphatic health.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.770 align:middle line:84%
This allows the body and
mind to access a deeper state

you're a friend of mine.

And it's so good to see you.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:90%
I haven't seen you in 15 years.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thrilled to be involved
in the conversation today.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Absolutely.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.022 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I look so forward.

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So, OK, let's start
from the beginning.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
You went to India
a long time ago.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And you went for
a three week trip.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And you stayed for
a year and a half.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:10%
You know, the
quick, long story--

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.470 align:middle line:10%
I was scheduled to ride
mountain bikes from Lhasa, Tibet

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:10%
to Kathmandu.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:10%
And the Chinese government
gave this window

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.670 align:middle line:10%
of where you could do that.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:84%
My brother-in-law,
who is Doug Henning--

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
the magician from
way back when--

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.735 align:middle line:84%
had a dream, vision,
a lucid dream,

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:90%
that there was an accident.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.793 align:middle line:84%
And I was paralyzed
from the waist down.

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing
wheelchair basketball.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And he said, please don't
go I was like, really?

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.650 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that to me.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:84%
My mother had a similar dream
and said, please don't go.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't go.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:90%
But I had all this time.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So I went to India to try
to study Ayurvedic medicine.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.725 align:middle line:84%
I went for a three
week vacation,

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and ended up finding
a teacher there

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:90%
who was willing to teach me.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And I stayed there
for a year and a half.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And when I came back,
somebody I didn't even know

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:90%
was driving my car.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
My stuff was in about
five different homes.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.340 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of put
it all together

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:90%
and started my life again.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you
literally just stayed?

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I
literally just stayed.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Just like,
I'm not coming back.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: I didn't come back.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:90%
I had a practice.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I called my partner and I
said, I'm not coming back.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And back then, it
took like an hour

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.120 align:middle line:90%
to get a line to call America.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.320 align:middle line:90%
And he could barely hear me.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And all he really got
was, I'm not coming back.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: And that was it.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And I just said,
you know, it's just

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.390 align:middle line:84%
kind of one of those things
where I just said, yes.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing this.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.900 align:middle line:84%
I had student loans
and a lot of reasons

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.840 align:middle line:84%
why I shouldn't have
done that, but I just

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.560 align:middle line:84%
knew that this was an
opportunity of a lifetime.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.912 align:middle line:90%
And what was really weird--

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and I stayed there
for a year and a half,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
studied Ayurvedic medicine,
met Deepak Chopra there,

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:84%
came back and ran a
center for eight years,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:90%
taught medical doctors.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But I never-- when
I was in India

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.820 align:middle line:84%
for that year and a half--
never, for one minute,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:84%
did I ever think
that I would actually

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
use Ayurvedic knowledge in
my life or in my practice.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.570 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like, oh, great.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.945 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get this knowledge
and come back and then do

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Ayurvedic medicine.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
I think I just think
too slow for that.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
I was just, like, so
wrapped up in the experience

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.420 align:middle line:90%
of the moment.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.150 align:middle line:84%
It was so juicy that I
just went like, I'm in.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.858 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
where this is going.

00:03:24.858 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't have a plan.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.275 align:middle line:84%
I think that was
the magic of it.

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
I was just so locked
into the present moment.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So I think
that that's really

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:90%
how authentic paths unfold.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.360 align:middle line:90%
It's one step at a time.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.978 align:middle line:90%
We're drawn into it.

00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:38.020 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like the
universe conspires to put us

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
in our true expression
in the world.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.533 align:middle line:84%
And that is definitely what I
have watched happen with you.

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little
bit about what

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:90%
it was like meeting Deepak.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we want to dive
into that a little bit.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
People love to hear about how
wonderful people work together,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.565 align:middle line:84%
find each other, and
produce amazing things.

00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:90%
What can you share with us?

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I met him in the
Oberoi Hotel in New Delhi.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And he was working in India
with Maharishi, the founder

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:90%
of the TM Organization.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was the hub
that I had as well,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.790 align:middle line:84%
because my sister
was really into that.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to go
into all the details,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:84%
but I ended up meeting my wife
from Santa Barbara in India.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
And we went back, got
married real quick,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and came back to India.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
And she was pregnant now,
fainting in the streets

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.830 align:middle line:90%
of New Delhi.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And it became clear we
had to get out of India

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:90%
and have this baby.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And Deepak said,
well, you know, I'm

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
having the opening of the
center in Massachusetts.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.320 align:middle line:90%
You can come back.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
You can co-direct it
with me, because I had

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.987 align:middle line:90%
all this Ayurvedic training.

00:04:34.987 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't a
lot of people who

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of Ayurvedic training
in the west at that point.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:90%
I came back and ran his center.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.137 align:middle line:84%
And we actually shared the
same desk for eight years.

00:04:46.137 --> 00:04:48.220 align:middle line:84%
He'd come two times a week,
I'd come three times--

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
two, three times a week-- and
became really good friends.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I have nothing
but the highest respect

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.540 align:middle line:90%
from his knowledge and wisdom.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I got to watch him grow
from being a medical doctor,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:90%
to being Deepak Chopra.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.030 align:middle line:84%
And it was an amazing
thing to watch.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
I learned a lot from him
about so many things,

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.320 align:middle line:84%
and how I wanted
to position myself

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:90%
in my life and my career.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, then,
you went into more

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.230 align:middle line:90%
of a private practice.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And you started expressing
your gifts and your desire

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.400 align:middle line:84%
to serve humanity
through Ayurveda.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.673 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a little
bit about what Ayurveda

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:26.090 align:middle line:84%
is for our viewers, and just
get everyone on the same page

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.500 align:middle line:90%
there?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So Deepak-- when I
travelled with Deepak,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:84%
and we lectured for eight
years together as well.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And he was like
the wow of people.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.133 align:middle line:84%
And I was the guy that would
come in after and then give

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:37.320 align:middle line:84%
them the nuts and bolts of
how to eat, how to sleep,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:90%
when to eat, what to eat--

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
all the details of how to
live a healthy, healthy life.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's been sort of
my world over the years,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
is working more one-on-one
and diving really deep

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.720 align:middle line:84%
into Ayurvedic health,
Ayurvedic psychology--

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:84%
and really understanding
how to help guide people

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:90%
on their journey to wellness.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And so tell us a little
bit about the foundation

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.810 align:middle line:84%
of Ayurveda-- the structure,
what it is as an approach

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.940 align:middle line:90%
to wellness--

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.857 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: There's two
definitions of Ayur--

00:06:07.857 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Ayu means "life", Veda
means "knowledge".

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.093 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of Ayurveda
as the science of life--

00:06:12.093 --> 00:06:13.510 align:middle line:84%
how to live in
sync and in harmony

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.923 align:middle line:84%
with the cycles of nature,
how to go downstream

00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:18.340 align:middle line:84%
with the current versus swimming
against the grain, right?

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:84%
We all feel that
against-the-grain feeling.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
You're exhausted at
the end of the day

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, recovering on
the weekend, stuff like that.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But then there's
the real definition

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.150 align:middle line:84%
of Ayurveda, which is sort
of the Vedic definition--

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Veda meaning "truth",
Ayu meaning "life".

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.960 align:middle line:84%
It's about a science to
unfold the truth of your life.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
How do you let who
you truly are out?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Because we all sort of know that
it's this crazy mind of ours

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.260 align:middle line:84%
that impacts us in ways
that take us out mentally,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.330 align:middle line:90%
physically, emotionally.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Most of our health concerns
come from how we handle

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:90%
or don't handle stress, right?

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So understanding that
component is huge.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.060 align:middle line:84%
So how do we let
the truth of us out?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.415 align:middle line:84%
How do we let go of old
protective patterns of behavior

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
we created as young children,
that we're still protecting

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.320 align:middle line:90%
on the screen today as adults?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:90%
How do we unravel all that?

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
How do we become conscious
and free ourselves

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.590 align:middle line:84%
from these patterns
that are based

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
on needing to be loved and
approved of and appreciated

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.380 align:middle line:90%
by everybody else?

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And how do we get
ourselves to be that love?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a little risky.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.400 align:middle line:84%
How do you let the delicate
petals of your flower open,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and let something delicate
and vulnerable-- yet,

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.450 align:middle line:90%
the most powerful part us--

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:90%
out?

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.800 align:middle line:90%
That's Ayurveda.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people
have it that Ayurveda

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.000 align:middle line:84%
is kind of compartmentalized
into these doshas.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And working with the doshas
gets you a start in a doorway

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
into starting to
understand this.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Can you just speak a little bit?

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:84%
I know that you have
your own understanding

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.830 align:middle line:90%
about the perspective there.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I think that the
doshas are really important.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
They are the aspects of
nature, the governing

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.840 align:middle line:90%
principles of nature.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.040 align:middle line:90%
Winter is Vata.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
It's cold and dry and
moving all the time.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And people with a lot of
Vata, they're cold and dry.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.495 align:middle line:84%
And they need more
blankets, you know?

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And their nervous
system is going

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.940 align:middle line:84%
really fast because
they have a lot of air

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:07.960 align:middle line:90%
in their constitution.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a very real thing.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:90%
The summer quality, Pitta--

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.593 align:middle line:90%
fire, heat, competitive, driven.

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:84%
We know people like that
are throwing off the covers

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.610 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we have spring
qualities, earth and water,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:90%
heavy, easygoing, calm.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And there's people that like
that, that hold onto more

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:90%
water, more congested, right?

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
principles of nature.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Now in Ayurveda,
it's such a given

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that when you look at someone,
you know instantly what

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.799 align:middle line:90%
Is it winter, summer, spring?

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Vata, Pitta, Kapha?

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's like taking
a car to a mechanic

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:90%
and then they go, it's a Ford.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we know it's a Ford.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And we
know it's a 1960 Ford,

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.800 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is, you know?

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's such a
basic part of Ayurveda

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and a platform from which
everything else comes.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's sort of
become, after a while,

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.720 align:middle line:84%
it becomes such an
instinctive understanding,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.290 align:middle line:84%
you don't talk
about it that much.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:84%
But it makes really good
sidebars in magazines.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Like, what's my body type?

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.110 align:middle line:90%
And what tea should I drink?

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And what herbs or
aroma should I smell?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.170 align:middle line:84%
Stuff like that, which
is all valuable too.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just that, you
know, in India, they

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.607 align:middle line:84%
do it a little differently
than it's done here.

00:09:14.607 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so it's a
way in for our culture.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:16.590 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's a way in for
us to begin to learn.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And then I know that
you take it deeper

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and you start speaking about
these circadian rhythms.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And you speak about digestion.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And you speak about
the lymphatic system.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And can you just speak
about how those interrelate,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:84%
and how it affects someone's
ability to heal or not heal?

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Ayurveda 101
is circadian medicine,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.070 align:middle line:84%
which is now Nobel
Prize-winning science.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I saw a study years ago
that the bugs in the soil

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.692 align:middle line:84%
changed from winter,
summer, to spring.

00:09:44.692 --> 00:09:46.150 align:middle line:84%
There was another
study that showed

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that deer, when they
eat bark in the winter,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.710 align:middle line:84%
they have certain bugs, microbes
for helping them digest bark,

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And in the summer,
they eat leaves.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And they have different bugs
for eating and digesting leaves.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And the studies show
that if the deer was

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to eat bark in the summer
when they didn't have

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
the right bugs,
it could literally

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:84%
cause such indigestion in the
deer, it could kill the deer.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I had written a book
called "The 3-Season Diet",

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.740 align:middle line:84%
eating with the seasons, kind
of tying Ayurvedic medicine

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.460 align:middle line:90%
to seasonal eating.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, whoa.

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Deer die when they
eat out of season?

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And now recently,
a Stanford study

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.527 align:middle line:84%
came out and showed
that the Hausa

00:10:24.527 --> 00:10:26.530 align:middle line:84%
tribe, the hunter/gatherer's
bugs in their gut

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
literally do change from
winter, summer, and spring, that

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
are the seasonal foods
that are coming seasonally,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:84%
inoculate our gut bugs with the
right bugs for the right season

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to give you immunity
in the winter,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.190 align:middle line:84%
decongestant in the spring,
dissipating heat in the summer.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:90%
It's the intelligence.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
It's our connection
to those rhythms.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And we process sprayed foods
that have no sterile bugs.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
We take herbs that are sterile,
like extracts of herbs.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're losing our connection
to the rhythms of nature.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And Ayurveda 101 is to
get that rhythm back.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So you start having
the right bugs feeding

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.540 align:middle line:84%
the right physiology
for the right season,

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.340 align:middle line:90%
at the right time.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:84%
So you wake up in the morning,
you go to sleep at night.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.170 align:middle line:90%
You're in sync with the rhythms.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:90%
That's step 1.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.260 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
that in rhythm,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.800 align:middle line:84%
you're exhausted at
the end of the day.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You're exhausted
on the weekends.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
You're constantly getting
sick, constantly getting

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:90%
run-down, stuff like that.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And we're in a
culture that is completely

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.138 align:middle line:90%
out of touch with that.

00:11:26.138 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
We are completely,
for the most part

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
as a culture, focused on
something entirely different,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:84%
a totally different
radio station.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.550 align:middle line:84%
If you were to give someone
a suggestion in this moment,

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.770 align:middle line:84%
just to drop them
into start this,

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
do this right now, to
just start to shift.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
continue a conversation.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
But they can start thinking in
terms of, OK, I could do that.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it could start to
make a big difference for them

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.680 align:middle line:84%
throughout our
entire conversation,

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.200 align:middle line:84%
to have a change in their
life, to connect again

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:84%
with the greatest
power on Earth.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: What would it be?

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:57.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What would it be?

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Nature.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Number 1,
getting in nature?

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.765 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Number 1, you
have to get into nature.

00:12:01.765 --> 00:12:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is a bio-hack for
when we came into civilization

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.400 align:middle line:84%
and we lost the
rhythms, the synchrony

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.782 align:middle line:90%
of nature and ourself.

00:12:10.782 --> 00:12:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So we then-- someone figured
out, if we just close our eyes

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and meditate, we can up-regulate
like 5,000 different genes

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:84%
and get all the
benefits of thousands

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.490 align:middle line:84%
of years of genetic expression
of being in sync with nature.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.350 align:middle line:90%
And we've lost that.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's step 1.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.483 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get out in nature.

00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:28.108 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So get your
mind out of the way.

00:12:28.108 --> 00:12:29.680 align:middle line:84%
Drop into who you
really are, even

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.900 align:middle line:84%
if you don't know it
or see visual things,

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.095 align:middle line:84%
or have some voice
speak to you and say,

00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:35.470 align:middle line:84%
this is the truth
of who you are.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a sensation
that comes over you

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that is that connection
that you're speaking about.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.090 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: The health benefits
forest bathing in Japan.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.760 align:middle line:84%
There's like 74 forests
that are certified

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.770 align:middle line:84%
to give you therapeutic benefit
when you walk through them.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:48.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I mean,
there's real hard science

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:90%
behind the benefits of that.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's ancient
wisdom to back it up.

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Awesome.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So I know that you're very
focused and have written books.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And we mentioned the books
about the seasonal eating.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
Speak to us about just a few
details about circadian eating,

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:84%
so that people understand
what those words mean.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, I
publish a recipe list

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
and a grocery list
and a super food

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
list for every single
month of the year for free.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can get it.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to
realize that, oh,

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.670 align:middle line:84%
in the winter when
it's cold and dry,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.580 align:middle line:84%
the squirrels are
eating nuts and seeds.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.072 align:middle line:84%
It's a higher fat, higher
protein time of the year.

00:13:24.072 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have this higher fat,
higher protein time of the year

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:27.655 align:middle line:90%
that happens in the winter.

00:13:27.655 --> 00:13:31.677 align:middle line:84%
We have a low fat, low
carb harvest in the spring,

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
when there's really
nothing harvested.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.302 align:middle line:84%
It's the calorie restricted,
intermittent fasting

00:13:35.302 --> 00:13:36.560 align:middle line:90%
time of the year.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we have summer, where
we eat more and more carbs,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.450 align:middle line:84%
and in the fall, lots of carbs
to store energy for winter

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.980 align:middle line:90%
and insulate us for winter.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:90%
The diet dramatically shifts.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And when you tie
into that, you start

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:90%
to crave what's in season.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
You get the benefits of the
bugs on those foods in your gut.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And you start to get
yourself back into rhythm.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And once in rhythm,
then a person feels what?

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.570 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: You wake up
in the morning refreshed.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:06.502 align:middle line:90%
You are tired in the evening.

00:14:06.502 --> 00:14:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You have energy
throughout the day.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.870 align:middle line:84%
How many people feel
exhausted at the end of day,

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.330 align:middle line:84%
are craving Starbucks at
3:00 in the afternoon, wake

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.980 align:middle line:90%
up feeling tired and exhausted?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.530 align:middle line:84%
They did a big study
here in Boulder at CU.

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.420 align:middle line:90%
They had healthy Boulderites.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And they checked their
circadian rhythms,

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.580 align:middle line:84%
their melatonin surges
and cortisol surges.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And the people were surging in
melatonin, which is the sleep

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:90%
hormone, during the day.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.590 align:middle line:84%
And they took him into the
wilderness-- no phones,

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.510 align:middle line:84%
no cell phones, no
nothing for a week.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And within one week, they 100%
reset their circadian clock.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They did it for a weekend,
67% start restoration

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.450 align:middle line:90%
of their circadian clock.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Take a no artificial
light weekend.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.948 align:middle line:90%
Turn off the Wi-Fi.

00:14:46.948 --> 00:14:47.990 align:middle line:90%
Turn off your cell phone.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:50.032 align:middle line:84%
Don't turn on any electricity,
any lights at all.

00:14:50.032 --> 00:14:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Use a candle and just
reset your rhythms.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.602 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is just
unplug and we reconnect it.

00:14:56.602 --> 00:14:58.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I also notice-- and
I actually remember having

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with you about
this about 15 years ago--

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.013 align:middle line:84%
that there's a difference
between looking at-- you're

00:15:04.013 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:90%
driving down the road.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.300 align:middle line:84%
There's a difference between
looking at the flowers that

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.842 align:middle line:84%
are blooming in the spring and
seeing how beautiful they are,

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:11.680 align:middle line:90%
versus really experiencing them.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Just dropping into
this state of exchange

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:84%
and being completely
present with what

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.400 align:middle line:90%
you're observing in nature.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So better than just
taking a walk in nature,

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.500 align:middle line:84%
having a deep
experience with nature

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.085 align:middle line:84%
as you're walking through to
drop into our true vibration

00:15:28.085 --> 00:15:28.885 align:middle line:90%
as well?

00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:31.427 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I mean, the science
backs up what you just said.

00:15:31.427 --> 00:15:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The brainwaves, when they
go really, really slow,

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.570 align:middle line:84%
that connects us to
spiritual experience.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It connects us to
what scientists

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.910 align:middle line:84%
call the unified field,
or some scientists

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.790 align:middle line:84%
are now calling the
Akashic record, where

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:90%
space and time are sort of one.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.312 align:middle line:84%
So when you are so stimulated
by the outside world

00:15:51.312 --> 00:15:53.770 align:middle line:84%
and our brainwaves are going
90 miles an hour all the time,

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.980 align:middle line:90%
we don't drop in.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
So we've traded that
millions of years

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:84%
of being totally
in sync and still

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.740 align:middle line:84%
with the silence of nature, for
an overstimulated environment.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:84%
And we've lost that connection
to our inner space, right?

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And the benefits of that
is, like, you actually

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.660 align:middle line:90%
are more intuitive.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.390 align:middle line:84%
The science is
there to prove that.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.780 align:middle line:84%
We can have gut feelings
and intuition and intuitive

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.840 align:middle line:84%
decision-making, and have
spiritual experiences

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
and know things that a lot
of psychics sort of have.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:90%
We all have that ability.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But we've traded in for being
stimulated and distracted

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.422 align:middle line:90%
by our senses.

00:16:31.422 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And Ayurveda talks
about using the senses

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.300 align:middle line:84%
as avenues of conciousness to
bring your attention within.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
So we come to our senses and
become more self-aware, as

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
opposed to being only
stimulated by what's out there.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.110 align:middle line:84%
So the science shows if we
can slow down those brainwaves

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.288 align:middle line:84%
and take that into our conscious
mind, amazing things happen.

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We start to
develop a sense of self,

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:84%
where we have less anxiety
and we stress less.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to
be more present.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And the body, then,
is able to self-heal.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:84%
And to generate its own healing
process is its true nature.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Let the
truth of you out.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.089 align:middle line:90%
That's the whole point.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.190 align:middle line:84%
All Veda-- anything that says
Vedic science, or Ayurveda,

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
or Dhanurveda, or all the
different Vedic aspects,

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.099 align:middle line:84%
they're all designed
for one thing--

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
to free who you
truly are, to help us

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.010 align:middle line:84%
get on the path of
our highest evolution.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So your book is
called "The 3-Season Diet".

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And I know people
are wondering, what

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:90%
happened to the fourth season?

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.640 align:middle line:84%
So you need to share a
little bit with everyone.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well, there's
four seasons, of course.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.700 align:middle line:84%
We didn't throw
that one out yet.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.783 align:middle line:84%
But there's three
growing seasons.

00:17:37.783 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So we interact with
nature in the spring

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.657 align:middle line:84%
with a spring harvest,
which is pretty austere.

00:17:41.657 --> 00:17:43.740 align:middle line:84%
We have a summer harvest,
which is quite different

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.840 align:middle line:84%
than the spring harvest-- more
carbs and less fats, or even

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.870 align:middle line:84%
more carbs and more fets,
just more fuel for the winter.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we have an
end-of-summer harvest,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.560 align:middle line:84%
which is, you know, the one that
lasts us through the winter--

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.940 align:middle line:84%
all the nuts and
seeds and grains

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.565 align:middle line:84%
that last through
the winter are there.

00:18:01.565 --> 00:18:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And nature, from its
perspective, giving us food,

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:90%
takes a break.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything in nature is based
on cycles of rest and activity.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.310 align:middle line:90%
And its resting cycle is winter.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So we have winter,
summer, spring harvests

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:90%
that we eat from.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And those are tied to the three
doshas of Vata, Pitta, Kapha.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.787 align:middle line:84%
So that's the trilogy
that Ayurveda talks about.

00:18:21.787 --> 00:18:23.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then the
relationship there

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.370 align:middle line:84%
between the human biome
that gets established,

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:29.453 align:middle line:90%
what cultivates there?

00:18:29.453 --> 00:18:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: In terms
of the microbiome?

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I
mean, the microbiome

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.980 align:middle line:84%
is also shifting from
winter to summer to spring.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So when we align our
intestinal tract,

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
which is our most important
protective barrier

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:90%
from the outside world.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And Ayurveda, they say
85% of all imbalances

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.030 align:middle line:90%
come from digestion.

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And if your digestive
skin lining breaks down,

00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:59.490 align:middle line:84%
that allows toxins
and impurities

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to move into your lymph, which
is the biggest circulatory

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:90%
system in your body.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.190 align:middle line:84%
It delivers fats for energy to
every single cell of your body.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.940 align:middle line:90%
It carries your immune system.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It's your detoxification system.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So if that system breaks
down or becomes congested,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:90%
you gain weight.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:16.380 align:middle line:90%
You get moody.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:90%
You become depressed.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
You don't have any energy,
become chronically fatigued.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And new research shows
that even the brain

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.190 align:middle line:84%
drains lymphatic
waste to the tune

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:29.100 align:middle line:84%
of 3 pounds of toxic chemicals
and plaque out of your brain

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.203 align:middle line:90%
every year while you sleep.

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And your big lymphs in
your muscles and stuff,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.652 align:middle line:84%
they move and drain while
you move throughout the day.

00:19:35.652 --> 00:19:37.485 align:middle line:84%
But the brain and the
central nervous system

00:19:37.485 --> 00:19:38.980 align:middle line:90%
are draining while you sleep.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't sleep
good, you don't drain good.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have
good lymphatic drainage,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.480 align:middle line:84%
you won't sleep
very well, either.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So the lymphatic
system in Ayurveda

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.260 align:middle line:84%
is the first system
we evaluate and treat,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.150 align:middle line:84%
because it's the
drainage system.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:84%
If the drains are clogged in
your house, you're in trouble.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:59.307 align:middle line:84%
You've got to fix that
before you do anything else.

00:19:59.307 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
how the body works.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.490 align:middle line:84%
In Western medicine,
we evaluate the blood.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:90%
We take your blood.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:84%
We look at your blood
and go, oh, there's

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.490 align:middle line:90%
something bad in your blood.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of times, the
thing that's bad in your blood

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.350 align:middle line:84%
is because the drainage
system's clogged and things

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.060 align:middle line:90%
are backing up into your blood.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.100 align:middle line:84%
So it just makes
more logical sense

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to put your attention
on your lymphatic system

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
as the first line of
defense for optimal health.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.122 align:middle line:90%
Because it drains everything.

00:20:22.122 --> 00:20:23.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we know
the body protects

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:84%
the bloodstream and
its chemistries as long

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.160 align:middle line:90%
as it possibly can.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So if we're addressing
something before it shows up

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:84%
in the bloodstream, we're
heading things off at the pass

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.668 align:middle line:84%
in such a more
preventive manner.

00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're speaking about
living a lifestyle that

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.240 align:middle line:84%
allows us to not
have to constantly

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.180 align:middle line:84%
be on the diagnostic
search, what's wrong,

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:84%
and being tested for
what's wrong all the time.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:48.220 align:middle line:84%
But rather, let's live in a
way that promotes wellness,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of self,
and a connection

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.800 align:middle line:84%
to nature, which is
our true destiny, how

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:90%
we're supposed to be operating.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.040 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.915 align:middle line:84%
My most recent book,
it's called "Eat Wheat".

00:20:56.915 --> 00:20:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And I had two debates
with David Perlmutter,

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.880 align:middle line:90%
the author of "Grain Brain".

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And I made the case that
it's not a grain brain issue.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a brain drain issue.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We have lost the ability
because of processed foods

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:90%
and bad fats--

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
polyunsaturated fatty
acids that replace

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:84%
saturated fats in
1960, when they told us

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:90%
cholesterol was bad.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And they replaced it with
canola oil and Crisco,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.740 align:middle line:90%
Those fats are indigestible.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And they break down
our digestive system.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
don't have the ability

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:84%
to break down things
like wheat and gluten.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, you can
take wheat and dairy out

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.430 align:middle line:90%
of someone's diet.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:84%
But in short order,
the problems come back.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.220 align:middle line:84%
And now, wheat and dairy have
become public enemy number

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.848 align:middle line:90%
one and number two.

00:21:49.848 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you take them out of
your diet, you feel better.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.320 align:middle line:84%
But have we fixed the reason
why you're not feeling good

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.650 align:middle line:90%
when you digest those foods?

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm all about taking them out.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:90%
But let's fix the problem.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't break those
foods down the way you should,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.825 align:middle line:84%
they go undigested into
your intestinal tract.

00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
They're too big to
get into your blood.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.327 align:middle line:90%
So where do they go?

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:08.910 align:middle line:84%
They get uptaken
into the garbage can,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.202 align:middle line:90%
which is your lymphatic system.

00:22:10.202 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And they clog your lymph.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And they make weight around
your belly or in your hips.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.575 align:middle line:84%
The lymph delivers energy
to every fat as energy

00:22:17.575 --> 00:22:18.700 align:middle line:90%
to every cell of your body.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't deliver
that fat as energy,

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:90%
you're exhausted.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.682 align:middle line:90%
So people get tired.

00:22:22.682 --> 00:22:25.140 align:middle line:84%
We have skin-associated lymphs,
where the body dumps it out

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:84%
as your skin as rashes that
people get when they eat wheat.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.655 align:middle line:84%
And we have brain fog, which
is when the brain lymphs get

00:22:30.655 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:84%
so congested because you took
all those proteins that you

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.572 align:middle line:84%
should have digested
that you've been

00:22:34.572 --> 00:22:38.428 align:middle line:84%
eating not for 10,000 years,
for 3 and 1/2 million years.

00:22:38.428 --> 00:22:40.470 align:middle line:84%
We've found gluten in the
teeth of ancient humans

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:41.920 align:middle line:90%
3 and 1/2 million years ago.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.798 align:middle line:90%
So this is not a new thing.

00:22:43.798 --> 00:22:45.840 align:middle line:84%
And that wheat, by the
way, had more gluten in it

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:90%
than the wheat we have today.

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So, again, makes you
wonder if gluten's really

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.490 align:middle line:90%
the public enemy number one.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.238 align:middle line:84%
And they found that that
gluten will find its way

00:22:54.238 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:90%
into the lymph, clog the lymph.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the brain can't drain
and you get brain fog.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a grain brain
issue, it's a brain drain issue.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's why Ayurveda says,
let's fix the digestion.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's turn that thing back on.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Let's detoxify the lymph and
the gallbladder, and the liver.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And decongest the body and
turn on the digestive system

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.850 align:middle line:90%
the way it was designed.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Part of that was
seasonal eating and kind

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.480 align:middle line:90%
of troubleshooting digestion.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.750 align:middle line:84%
And bring our ability
to digest foods back,

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:84%
because those
hard-to-digest foods are

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.940 align:middle line:84%
the triggers of the stimulants
for an immune response.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
We have an immune
system, gut immunity,

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:84%
because we ate poisonous
foods-- goitrogens, oxalates,

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.940 align:middle line:90%
nightshades-- these foods--

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
glutens, anti-nutrients,
lectins--

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.457 align:middle line:84%
they are the triggers
for an immune response.

00:23:44.457 --> 00:23:47.040 align:middle line:84%
If you just say, I feel bad when
I eat them, and take them out

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
of the diet and don't
fix the problem, what's

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.570 align:middle line:84%
going to happen to
our immune response?

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
We already see the
studies showing

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.100 align:middle line:84%
people who are gluten-free
have four times more mercury

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.975 align:middle line:84%
in their blood than the
people who eat wheat.

00:23:57.975 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
They have less good bugs, more
bad bugs, and less killer T

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.640 align:middle line:90%
cells than people who eat wheat.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.700 align:middle line:84%
The science is already
here, suggesting that this,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.380 align:middle line:90%
just fixing the symptom--

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:84%
don't eat X, Y, and Z, and eat
a more purified simple diet--

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.747 align:middle line:90%
leaves us immune-compromised.

00:24:12.747 --> 00:24:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Just like taking
cholesterol out of the diet

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.872 align:middle line:84%
caused more heart disease,
more obesity, more diabetes,

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
and more depression,
what's going to happen

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:90%
with this new crazy idea--

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
take wheat, dairy,
lectins out of our diet--

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:84%
without strengthening
the digestive strength

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and supporting an
immune response?

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.430 align:middle line:84%
It's going to leave us way more
vulnerable to the super bugs

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.430 align:middle line:84%
down the road, which are
right around the corner

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:34.170 align:middle line:84%
when antibiotics
fail on us, right?

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So we keep just going
after treating symptoms

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.180 align:middle line:90%
and never looking at the cause.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's a dangerous
road to hoe.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's so symbolic.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It's symbolic about how
we're approaching everything,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:44.880 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We're pieces and
parts, and becoming

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.560 align:middle line:84%
mechanistic about our
approach to having a better

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.505 align:middle line:84%
idea than what nature had
in store from the beginning.

00:24:52.505 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And so what you're doing
is encouraging us to like,

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:55.440 align:middle line:90%
just stop.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Just time out, here.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.040 align:middle line:84%
It's not about the latest
fad and the latest research

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.377 align:middle line:84%
that is showing that if
you do this, this happens.

00:25:01.377 --> 00:25:03.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about, let's look
at the whole picture.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.877 align:middle line:84%
Let's remember that
we are whole beings.

00:25:04.877 --> 00:25:09.030 align:middle line:84%
And let's allow that whole
being to have a life.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.060 align:middle line:84%
And that, in turn, turns
this digestive system on

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and allows drainage to occur,
and allows the immune system

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.130 align:middle line:84%
to do what it's built
to do, without us trying

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to think for this
miraculous system

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.240 align:middle line:90%
that we have in place here.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're basically
also saying, though,

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.360 align:middle line:84%
that there is a season
where your digestion might

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.430 align:middle line:84%
be stronger for
certain types of things

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:90%
and other things, et cetera.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So to draw the conclusion
that I can't tolerate

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.413 align:middle line:84%
that is perhaps a fallacy
as well, that maybe I'm

00:25:35.413 --> 00:25:37.080 align:middle line:84%
eating the wrong thing
at the wrong time

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:90%
because I'm just out of touch.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Can you--

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.258 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Great science
to back that up too.

00:25:41.258 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the enzyme for
wheat is called amylase.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.770 align:middle line:84%
We expressed the gene
to make our own amylase

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
about 2 million
years ago, suggesting

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that we are enough
starch in our diet

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to create our own enzyme
for digesting starch

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.960 align:middle line:90%
about 2 million years ago.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.000 align:middle line:84%
That enzyme today, in
your body and my body--

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:90%
still to this day--

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.672 align:middle line:84%
increases inside of us
in the fall, and less

00:26:07.672 --> 00:26:08.880 align:middle line:90%
in the spring and the summer.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.130 align:middle line:84%
So we make the enzyme
for wheat, guess what?

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.900 align:middle line:90%
When it's harvested.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.390 align:middle line:84%
The digestive parasympathetic
nervous system

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.880 align:middle line:84%
increases in the colder
climate to break down

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.530 align:middle line:84%
nuts and seeds and
grains and meats

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.540 align:middle line:84%
that you would need
to eat in the winter,

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.940 align:middle line:84%
because you can't take
anything out of your garden.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
In the summertime, the
foods are cooked on the vine

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
to digest them.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
And you need increasing
digestive fire

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.880 align:middle line:84%
in the summer when
it's super hot,

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.340 align:middle line:84%
was one of our
strategies to survive

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
as homosapiens, where the
Neanderthals didn't do that.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.670 align:middle line:84%
We survived because we
have the weighted ability

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.990 align:middle line:90%
to dissipate heat.

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.570 align:middle line:84%
One of those ways was not
to cook this massive--

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.303 align:middle line:84%
stoke this massive
digestive fire

00:26:48.303 --> 00:26:49.470 align:middle line:90%
in the middle of the summer.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.240 align:middle line:84%
Although we do that
now because we can go

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.010 align:middle line:90%
into an air conditioned house.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.450 align:middle line:90%
So we've lost that connection.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's just such
logical science

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:01.810 align:middle line:84%
to say, hey, we have the ability
to digest wheat and grains

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.290 align:middle line:90%
at a certain time of the year.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And in the
springtime, right now,

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:05.680 align:middle line:84%
if you and I were
living off the land,

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.330 align:middle line:84%
where are we going
to get any grain?

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.130 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:90%
There is none.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.870 align:middle line:90%
So it's a grain-free.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.400 align:middle line:90%
The dairy is for the baby cow.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.500 align:middle line:84%
You go in there and
try to get the milk out

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.710 align:middle line:84%
from the mama cow for the baby
cow, that ain't gonna happen.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Strap them down,
or whatever, right?

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's a grain-free, dairy-free
time of the year right now

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.780 align:middle line:90%
in the spring.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.868 align:middle line:84%
And then, come summer,
the rules change.

00:27:24.868 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
We've just got to
get back into that.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't mean you have
to only eat seasonal food.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:84%
The idea is, think about
what you should eat more of.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Get medicinal dosage of what's
in season and enjoy your life.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.567 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the processed food.

00:27:37.567 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a real important
piece of the puzzle.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Organic food, because
the pesticides

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that they spray on our
food kill the microbes that

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.532 align:middle line:84%
make the enzymes to help us
digest the hard-to-digest stuff

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:49.740 align:middle line:84%
like wheat, dairy, grains,
lectins, and those things.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat a lot
of non-organic food,

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:54.310 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be
killing a lot of bugs that

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.570 align:middle line:90%
help you have good digestion.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
piece of the puzzle.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:57.670 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Now you also speak
about how often

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
to eat small meals, large
meals, how often during the day.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak about that?

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: You know, in
India, there's an old saying.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It says, one meal a
day is for a yogi.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Two meals is for a bogey, which
is a working class person.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.420 align:middle line:84%
They need more food because
they're doing physical labor.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And three meals a
day is for a rogie,

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.935 align:middle line:84%
who is a sick person,
mostly dead in a hospital.

00:28:21.935 --> 00:28:24.310 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a name for
four, five, and six meal a day

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Because you're mostly
good at three, right?

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's called
western world.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
That's when we're
doing six meals a day.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:29.998 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But
the cool thing is,

00:28:29.998 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
you know, the culture is saying,
hey, intermittent fasting,

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.140 align:middle line:84%
time-restricted eating,
it's a big thing.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.720 align:middle line:90%
This is not new.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.220 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda said one meal a
day thousands of years ago,

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.810 align:middle line:90%
two meals a day max, you know?

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:44.020 align:middle line:84%
We're eating three,
five, six meals a day.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:44.950 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.333 align:middle line:90%
We eat way too much.

00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And now we know that
when you don't eat,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.880 align:middle line:84%
you produce autophagy,
which is the cleaning

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.910 align:middle line:84%
of your lymphatic
system and restoring

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:84%
bad cells into good cells,
and doing some repair.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.380 align:middle line:84%
It increases stem
cell activation.

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.640 align:middle line:90%
We rebuild and rejuvenate.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.640 align:middle line:84%
These were things that Ayurveda
talked about thousands of years

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:03.840 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.380 align:middle line:84%
There's something
called Kaya Kalpa,

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.455 align:middle line:90%
the rejuvenation of the body.

00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And I've written some
articles recently about that.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.997 align:middle line:84%
And we have a cleanse called
the Kaya Kalpa cleanse, which

00:29:11.997 --> 00:29:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is coming out very
soon, all about how

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:18.820 align:middle line:84%
to mimic the ancient wisdom
and the modern science

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.540 align:middle line:84%
about autophagy and stem
cell activation by doing what

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedists had to do thousands
of years ago on a four or five

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:25.090 align:middle line:90%
day cleanse.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:25.940 align:middle line:90%
Super easy.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So cutting-edge
thought is

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.760 align:middle line:84%
to rediscover what we've
known for thousands of years.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.695 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's pretty amazing.

00:29:32.695 --> 00:29:34.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It
always amazes me.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
This is why, in my
website at lifespa.com,

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.602 align:middle line:84%
we write all about ancient
wisdom and modern science.

00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And I thought when
I first started,

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.420 align:middle line:90%
I'd write two or three articles.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like, done.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:46.660 align:middle line:84%
We have thousands
of articles online.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm so blown away constantly
by how much they knew

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:54.200 align:middle line:84%
and how insightful they were
about the subtlety of nature.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And what they knew
was something--

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I think, the most profound
thing, is that the most subtle

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:90%
it is, the most powerful it is.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.560 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
the microbiome.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
They called them
Krimi in Ayurveda

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.400 align:middle line:90%
3,500 years ago before Christ--

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.460 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years ago, total.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how did they know
that the microbiome existed?

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.690 align:middle line:90%
Because they couldn't see them.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.815 align:middle line:90%
But they wrote about them.

00:30:14.815 --> 00:30:16.190 align:middle line:84%
They wrote about
how to fix them.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.870 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a very fascinating thing.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I know that we were together
in some various meditation

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.723 align:middle line:84%
practices in India
and in the US.

00:30:24.723 --> 00:30:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
started to happen for me,

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:28.540 align:middle line:84%
when my third eye
opened, was that I

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.313 align:middle line:84%
could start to see the internal
architecture inside my brain.

00:30:32.313 --> 00:30:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I could start to
see these things.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And I could start to witness
the flow of different fluids

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.130 align:middle line:84%
through different
systems within mine.

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And I recognized that what
you're speaking about,

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe, is quite
possibly, that they

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:48.100 align:middle line:84%
were able to perceive on this
super, super subtle level,

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and could be in touch with
the rhythms of nature--

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and how these tiny
particles were

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.330 align:middle line:84%
moving together
and creating life,

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.710 align:middle line:90%
and be in touch with that.

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were recording what
they were able to observe.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is what you're
speaking about now,

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.830 align:middle line:84%
that that is behind
this information that

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.700 align:middle line:90%
is based in Ayurveda today.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: The
lymphatics in the brain

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.240 align:middle line:84%
we talked about,
newly-discovered eight years

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.900 align:middle line:90%
ago at University of Virginia.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Now they realize that
when these get congested,

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.280 align:middle line:84%
they're linked to anxiety,
depression, cognitive decline,

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.460 align:middle line:84%
inflammation, infection,
and autoimmune conditions.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.950 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda developed,
5,000 years ago,

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:29.860 align:middle line:84%
techniques to clean
out those brains.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:34.030 align:middle line:84%
New science shows that those
lymphs drain into one place,

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:90%
into the lymphs in your nose.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So they developed a
technique thousands of years

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.990 align:middle line:84%
ago called nossia,
where you sniff

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.990 align:middle line:84%
medically herbally-infused
oils into your nose

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
after you heat and lubricate
and massage your head,

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:84%
to open up these channels
so you can clean out

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.857 align:middle line:84%
the sagittal sinus where all
these brain lymphs are located.

00:31:51.857 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:84%
I've written articles
showing pictures

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.730 align:middle line:84%
of where the brain lymphs
were thousands of years ago,

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.272 align:middle line:84%
and what they've
recently discovered.

00:31:57.272 --> 00:31:59.150 align:middle line:90%
And they're identical.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And they knew exactly where
these drained into the nose.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.420 align:middle line:84%
We only just figured
that out eight years ago.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And they had therapies
to clean them out.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And I used those for 26 years
when I did deep rejuvenation,

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.230 align:middle line:84%
to carry people through
retreats and detox retreats.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And the emotional
transformation,

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.190 align:middle line:84%
the release of all emotional
trauma was unbelievable.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.280 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get those
blocks out of your brain,

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.720 align:middle line:84%
we hold onto those
old emotional traumas

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.330 align:middle line:90%
and we just don't let them go.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.490 align:middle line:84%
It's a big important
piece of the puzzle.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.277 align:middle line:84%
And I've written an article
about a step-by-step procedure

00:32:31.277 --> 00:32:32.360 align:middle line:90%
of how to do that at home.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
People can watch it and
read it and go, wow.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the original
technique to free yourself

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.410 align:middle line:84%
from all the emotional
trauma and let

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.980 align:middle line:84%
yourself open those delicate
petals of your flower.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.780 align:middle line:84%
And let yourself
be more vulnerable.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And let something
real and more truthful

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.900 align:middle line:84%
out, and not be
constantly interacting

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.000 align:middle line:84%
with life based on your
protective patterns.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:59.243 align:middle line:84%
So I work with bioenergetics,
and the emotional impact on how

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.160 align:middle line:84%
energy flows through the
body, and our ability

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:84%
to understand what's
happening in ourselves

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and our interior realm,
and in our exterior realm,

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.920 align:middle line:84%
and in the combination
of those two.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's commonly
known that sinuses

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.160 align:middle line:84%
are related to
longstanding grief that is

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.840 align:middle line:90%
unresolved, unresolved emotion.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
number one reasons

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.400 align:middle line:84%
that the right hemisphere
and the left hemisphere

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:84%
of the brain aren't
interacting any longer.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And what you're describing right
here along this sagittal line,

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.380 align:middle line:84%
it makes perfect
sense that clearing

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.110 align:middle line:84%
that is going to allow us
to operate as a whole being,

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.090 align:middle line:84%
rather than just a right-brained
or left-brained focused

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:36.890 align:middle line:90%
individual.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.473 align:middle line:84%
And again, finding our
wholeness and allowing healing.

00:33:39.473 --> 00:33:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Do I have
time for a quick story?

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:41.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Sure.

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So this
one woman came to me.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.757 align:middle line:84%
And she had a hyperthyroid
issue, her goiter in her neck

00:33:46.757 --> 00:33:48.590 align:middle line:84%
that was as big as a
grapefruit in her neck.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And she wanted me to treat it.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And we ended up giving her
some of these treatments

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.530 align:middle line:90%
to clean out the brain.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And because there's such an
emotional unraveling there,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I always gave them, like,
some journaling to do

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:90%
and some self-injury practices.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And she said after her third
treatment of cleaning out

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.650 align:middle line:84%
this sagittal sinus--
it was like a Mohawk

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.160 align:middle line:90%
haircut, exactly where it is.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.080 align:middle line:84%
She said she was sitting
there writing in her journal,

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.163 align:middle line:90%
and she had this epiphany.

00:34:10.163 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:84%
She said, I was
watching myself be

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.960 align:middle line:90%
abused when I was 14 years old.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.210 align:middle line:90%
She said, it was really crazy.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I completely blocked
that out of my mind.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.120 align:middle line:90%
I didn't remember it.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.780 align:middle line:84%
But what was really
even more striking

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.780 align:middle line:84%
was I wasn't so affected
by the event itself.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.120 align:middle line:84%
What I was really
struck by was my life

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.850 align:middle line:84%
before the event--
happy-go-lucky child.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.550 align:middle line:84%
The event happened, and then
I became this hypervigilant,

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:33.980 align:middle line:84%
90-hour-a-week corporate
executive stressed-out

00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:36.889 align:middle line:84%
individual-- color-coded closet,
just everything had to be

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:38.330 align:middle line:90%
perfect for her to be safe.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.800 align:middle line:90%
And she said, I saw that life.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.090 align:middle line:10%
I saw my life before.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:41.949 align:middle line:10%
I saw that event.

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:43.782 align:middle line:10%
And she goes, it wasn't
great, but it wasn't

00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:45.260 align:middle line:10%
worth 25 years of my life.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I was just
able to just drop it.

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
See, when you become aware that
the emotional trauma that you

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.360 align:middle line:84%
had actually blocked you from
experiencing your truth--

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:84%
her life, her joy,
which is still there--

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.850 align:middle line:84%
all she had to do
was just drop it,

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and she allowed herself
to actually start

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.770 align:middle line:90%
to experience joy.

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Within the week
of that treatment,

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.060 align:middle line:84%
her goiter completely
disappeared.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Her thyroid numbers
came down 400 points.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Within six months, her
thyroid completely normalized.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.270 align:middle line:84%
I saw her last
Christmas in Denver

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.880 align:middle line:84%
after like 15 years or
something-- a long time.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.340 align:middle line:84%
She came back with
two kids in tow,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.137 align:middle line:84%
running up to me
saying, Dr. John.

00:35:24.137 --> 00:35:25.970 align:middle line:84%
I just want you to meet
my little girls, who

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.670 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be here
because of that event,

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.660 align:middle line:84%
because she had that old trauma,
and I think, probably not

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.520 align:middle line:90%
a color-coded closet anymore.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The point is that we hold
onto these emotions, molecules

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:38.760 align:middle line:90%
of emotion we store.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.260 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, it's
called mental ama.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.160 align:middle line:84%
We store them on our fat, and
our muscle, and in our brain

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.380 align:middle line:84%
so we don't have
to feel the pain.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.895 align:middle line:90%
But we bridge around it.

00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And we create patterns
of protective behavior

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that keep us from
accessing who we truly are.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.988 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Ayurveda was all about.

00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And they developed a
technique to clean that out.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.240 align:middle line:84%
We are light years away
from that to this day.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, I write
about all the research

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.550 align:middle line:84%
in the journals about the
lymphatic flow and all that.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.430 align:middle line:84%
They say it takes about
25 years for that research

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.060 align:middle line:90%
to hit medical practice.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:14.870 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be a long time
before we see any real therapy

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:19.400 align:middle line:84%
revolving around lymphatic
flow or freeing up

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:22.078 align:middle line:84%
our emotions that are real deep
at the physiological level.

00:36:22.078 --> 00:36:23.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And it's so, so
important that we're

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.037 align:middle line:84%
putting these pieces together
and allowing ourselves

00:36:26.037 --> 00:36:29.002 align:middle line:84%
to land back in the truth that
we are whole and complete.

00:36:29.002 --> 00:36:29.960 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing broken.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.740 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing missing.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.743 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing wrong.

00:36:31.743 --> 00:36:32.660 align:middle line:90%
We have what it takes.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.327 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of connecting
the dots again and sitting down

00:36:35.327 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
inside ourselves and
letting it be true.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.080 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: True.

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.470 align:middle line:90%
It's inside of us.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.620 align:middle line:84%
For thousands of
years, Ayurvedic wisdom

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:84%
has held the belief
that toxins in the body

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.790 align:middle line:84%
can cause overall
health imbalance.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Once again, ancient wisdom
precedes modern science.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.168 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:36:52.168 --> 00:36:54.120 align:middle line:90%

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUJATHA REDDY: If you are
eating in a rushed, hurried way

00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.850 align:middle line:84%
and just gobbling up your
food and you are really

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:03.570 align:middle line:84%
not secreting the juices and
giving it time to digest,

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.610 align:middle line:84%
the food is going
to pass through

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:07.830 align:middle line:90%
without being digested properly.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And it is going to form what
we call as ama in Ayurveda.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:90%
That is toxins.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And those toxins are going
to be absorbed in our system

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and manifest in the form
of discomfort or disease.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It is going to put
us out of balance.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:31.740 align:middle line:84%
That is why these days, you
see a lot of imbalances.

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is children
or families or adults,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:84%
not mindful about
these routines is

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:90%
making us more sick than ever.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is the
most common imbalance?

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Digestive.

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:48.840 align:middle line:90%
It all starts in the digestive.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And what she said
there is so valuable.

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.210 align:middle line:90%
But the science is basic.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.760 align:middle line:84%
When you're
stressed, you produce

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.580 align:middle line:84%
the fight-or-flight
stress response.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:84%
That fight-or-flight, when
you're running away from a bear

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.828 align:middle line:84%
up a tree, there's
zero digestive fuel.

00:38:05.828 --> 00:38:07.870 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Right, not going
waste the energy on that.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It's
totally turned off.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Run from the bear.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.190 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Totally turned off.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But
when you relax, you

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:15.282 align:middle line:84%
activate the opposite
nervous system, called

00:38:15.282 --> 00:38:16.740 align:middle line:84%
the parasympathetic
nervous system,

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.990 align:middle line:84%
called the rest-and-digest
nervous system, which

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.230 align:middle line:90%
is turned on.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So when you're eating, like she
said, on the run-- on the run--

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.380 align:middle line:84%
the reason why the food goes
undigested, like she said,

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.090 align:middle line:84%
is because we literally
have turned off

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:29.593 align:middle line:90%
our ability to digest anything.

00:38:29.593 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So we think how many people
are eating their food in front

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:33.630 align:middle line:84%
of the TV, in front
of a scary movie,

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.400 align:middle line:84%
in their car driving,
on the run, go.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:35.700 align:middle line:90%
Eat it.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Inhale.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Go, go, go.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.950 align:middle line:84%
This is insanity, really, when
you think about our ability

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.260 align:middle line:84%
to actually have a
nervous system, which

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.540 align:middle line:84%
turns on your digestion, to be
able to actually pull that off.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's just complete, basic,
logical science 101.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And the more you do it,
the more your body craves it.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And it just keeps
perpetuating that cycle

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.890 align:middle line:90%
and living in that fashion.

00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:59.640 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Because
if you don't actually

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.790 align:middle line:84%
completely digest it, the
brain never gets the message

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:03.750 align:middle line:90%
that you ate.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:04.710 align:middle line:90%
I chewed it.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:06.055 align:middle line:90%
I swallowed it.

00:39:06.055 --> 00:39:06.930 align:middle line:90%
I knew it was coming.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:07.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I saw it.

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:09.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: But it never came.

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:10.620 align:middle line:90%
So what does the brain do?

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.155 align:middle line:84%
It sends more hormone to
say, hey, I'm still hungry.

00:39:13.155 --> 00:39:14.405 align:middle line:90%
I never got what you guys ate.

00:39:14.405 --> 00:39:16.170 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where it went,
but it didn't come here.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So we crave more,
crave more, crave more.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.498 align:middle line:84%
We're associating the more
need and more lack, more--

00:39:21.498 --> 00:39:23.540 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And the
undigested part of that food

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:25.140 align:middle line:84%
that you talked about,
where does it go?

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Into the garbage can,
which is the collecting

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:28.602 align:middle line:84%
ducts of your
lymphatic system, which

00:39:28.602 --> 00:39:31.782 align:middle line:84%
is the lion's share of that
lines your intestinal tract.

00:39:31.782 --> 00:39:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's trying
to deliver energy

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.410 align:middle line:90%
to every cell of your body.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.370 align:middle line:90%
So that ain't going to happen.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.203 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
exhausted and the brain's

00:39:37.203 --> 00:39:39.100 align:middle line:84%
going to go, where'd
that fuel go?

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:39.900 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:40.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right?

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:41.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So let's circle the wagons
for just a second, and say,

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:46.015 align:middle line:84%
what does the
lymphatic system do?

00:39:46.015 --> 00:39:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's just make sure
all of our viewers

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.410 align:middle line:84%
are able to get the
value of this system.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Because usually, people only
hear about the lymphatic system

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.675 align:middle line:84%
when they ask if the disease had
spread to the lymphatic system.

00:39:57.675 --> 00:39:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
what all people know.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So let's educate some people
about the lymphatic system.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:02.870 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Super easy.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Three things, number 1,
the lion's share of it

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.220 align:middle line:90%
lines your intestinal tract.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.300 align:middle line:90%
So what is it doing?

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It's taking fats
that are properly

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.100 align:middle line:84%
digested to every cell of
your body for baseline energy.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.770 align:middle line:84%
Without that, you're
exhausted, chronic fatigue.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Number 2, it carries
your immune system.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.590 align:middle line:84%
If that immune system
is stuck in traffic,

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.510 align:middle line:84%
your immune system
is not going to know,

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:84%
do I send one firetruck
to the fire on Broadway?

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Do I send 100?

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.680 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It overreacts or underreacts.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:33.050 align:middle line:84%
An overreaction is an autoimmune
condition, underreaction,

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.050 align:middle line:90%
other bad things happen.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.730 align:middle line:90%
You become sick.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the final thing it
does is it's the garbage can.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Any undigested
food, like mercury

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:44.130 align:middle line:84%
that are on all our organic
vegetables from the coal mine

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:44.970 align:middle line:90%
plumes--

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.920 align:middle line:84%
or gluten, or
undigested proteins,

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.370 align:middle line:84%
or lectins that we have
blamed as the big problem--

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.745 align:middle line:90%
they go undigested.

00:40:51.745 --> 00:40:54.120 align:middle line:84%
They get uptaken into the
collecting ducts of your lymph.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And they clog it up.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:59.700 align:middle line:84%
So you have all these lymphy
things, skin rashes, brain fog,

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.410 align:middle line:90%
tiredness, lethargy.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:05.100 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely
a predicted event

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.912 align:middle line:84%
because you did not break
those foods down properly.

00:41:08.912 --> 00:41:09.870 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it does.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a garbage can.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.252 align:middle line:84%
It's a carrier of
your immune system.

00:41:12.252 --> 00:41:14.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's a delivery
of fats for energy

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.980 align:middle line:90%
to every cell of your body.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.290 align:middle line:90%
It's important stuff.

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: No kidding.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like this
unconditional friend that

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.470 align:middle line:84%
is standing there waiting
for you to do everything

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.950 align:middle line:90%
that you do.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And they're there to
pick up the pieces.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
completely unconscious,

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.850 align:middle line:84%
it has a lot of
pieces to pick up.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:29.930 align:middle line:90%
And we're overworking it.

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.013 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: So let me
give you a couple of things

00:41:32.013 --> 00:41:33.420 align:middle line:90%
that they might relate to.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.630 align:middle line:84%
When it's congested, you could
get brain fog, tiredness,

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:41.057 align:middle line:84%
lethargy, skin rashes,
swelling, toenail funguses.

00:41:41.057 --> 00:41:42.390 align:middle line:90%
Rings get tight on your fingers.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Belly fat, hip fat, cellulite,
allergy, sinus congestion,

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.833 align:middle line:90%
headaches.

00:41:48.833 --> 00:41:51.000 align:middle line:84%
You're worse in the morning
because the lymph pools.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.230 align:middle line:90%
You're stiff in the morning.

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
Pain that moves around
your body, joint issues--

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.280 align:middle line:84%
these are the things
that most people have.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:04.432 align:middle line:84%
And these are the early
symptoms that happen.

00:42:04.432 --> 00:42:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And then, when that
gets congested,

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:09.370 align:middle line:84%
the default for all those
toxins is they take it back

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:10.480 align:middle line:90%
to the liver.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:84%
And then it starts to
screw with your ability

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.585 align:middle line:84%
to digest hard-to-digest foods,
because your liver makes bile.

00:42:16.585 --> 00:42:18.310 align:middle line:84%
And if your bile is
not made, the bile

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.780 align:middle line:84%
is a buffer for the
acid in your stomach.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
have good bile flow,

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.220 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to make acid, which

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.992 align:middle line:84%
means you're not going to cook
any hard-to-digest food, right?

00:42:26.992 --> 00:42:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
make acid, you've

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:30.460 align:middle line:84%
got to have somebody
put that fire out.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.570 align:middle line:90%
That's your bile.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:90%
No bile, no acid.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:90%
No acid, no bile.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.520 align:middle line:84%
So if your liver is
congested because of years

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.292 align:middle line:84%
of intestinal irritation, lymph
congestion, and now the toxins

00:42:40.292 --> 00:42:42.250 align:middle line:84%
are congesting your liver
and your gall bladder

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.380 align:middle line:84%
eating processed food
and bad fats that all

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.180 align:middle line:90%
go to your gallbladder anyway--

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:84%
number one abdominal
surgery in America

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.440 align:middle line:84%
today, gallbladder removal
surgery from all the

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.710 align:middle line:84%
processed bad fats they
put as preservators

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:90%
in all of our food.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.970 align:middle line:84%
The bread has oil in it
that keeps it squishy

00:42:57.970 --> 00:42:59.590 align:middle line:90%
on the shelf for a month.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Bread used to, like,
last for a day.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.002 align:middle line:84%
That's why bakers
had a job every day.

00:43:03.002 --> 00:43:04.960 align:middle line:84%
Now they can bake bread
once every three months

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.820 align:middle line:90%
and the bread's still squishy.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Those oils that are the
preservatives in our food,

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:11.410 align:middle line:90%
they're not digestible.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:13.020 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the bugs would've
ate them on the counter.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.820 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.630 align:middle line:84%
It's like, if the bugs
don't eat it, don't eat it.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:19.210 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And that's
all we eat, as processed

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:20.925 align:middle line:90%
foods in the grocery store.

00:43:20.925 --> 00:43:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And it all goes right to your
liver, congests your liver.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Gallbladder has become
congested, bile becomes thick.

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:26.860 align:middle line:90%
No bile, no acid.

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.130 align:middle line:90%
No bile, no poop.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Bile makes you poop, by the way.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:90%
That keeps everything moving.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It cleanses your villi
in your intestinal skin.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And when that liver gets
congested because the lymph got

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.330 align:middle line:84%
congested first--
that's the first thing--

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:40.538 align:middle line:84%
then the liver and the blood
backed up to your blood.

00:43:40.538 --> 00:43:42.038 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
we talked about.

00:43:42.038 --> 00:43:44.093 align:middle line:84%
First, the lymph, the
drains, and then the blood.

00:43:44.093 --> 00:43:45.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's your liver.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And when that gets
congested, not only does it

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.150 align:middle line:84%
push all this oxygen back into
your blood and cause problems,

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.300 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't allow
your stomach to make

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:54.730 align:middle line:84%
the acid it needs to break
down the wheat and the dairy,

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:57.670 align:middle line:84%
the hard-to-digest proteins,
or the environmental pollutants

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.700 align:middle line:90%
as fats.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up
with the inability

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.190 align:middle line:84%
to digest certain foods,
and you blame the food.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And
that's what happened.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We're just not
giving the system a chance.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:07.360 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have
a fighting chance

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:07.730 align:middle line:90%
with how we're treating it.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:08.938 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: It's so logical.

00:44:08.938 --> 00:44:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I just go crazy, because
we have this mental--

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.830 align:middle line:84%
this Western medical
model that we're just

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:19.000 align:middle line:84%
going to blame the symptom
and fix the symptom for you,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.575 align:middle line:90%
and not look any further.

00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:21.700 align:middle line:90%
But if you're in practice--

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.160 align:middle line:90%
I mean, when I was in practice--

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:25.660 align:middle line:90%
1984, I got into practice.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.720 align:middle line:84%
It became very clear to
me that you take people

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:32.360 align:middle line:84%
off wheat and dairy, within six
months, the problem came back.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Give them digestive enzymes,
the problem comes back.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Because we keep trying to
do the job for the body.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:42.350 align:middle line:84%
We gave them probiotics way
back then, in the dark old ages.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:43.240 align:middle line:90%
And same thing.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.190 align:middle line:84%
They felt better when
they were on them.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:47.493 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as they got
off, things came back.

00:44:47.493 --> 00:44:49.160 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't really
fixing the problem.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.330 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was sort of
dedicated my practice to, is

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:54.460 align:middle line:84%
understanding, how
can I get the body

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.440 align:middle line:84%
to not be dependent
on a pill or a powder,

00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:58.678 align:middle line:90%
and establish self-sufficiency?

00:44:58.678 --> 00:45:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I've been
doing my whole entire career,

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.670 align:middle line:84%
was helping people get
self-sufficient, reboot

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:04.563 align:middle line:90%
digestive strength.

00:45:04.563 --> 00:45:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And along the way, you
realize, oh my god, digestion

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:07.530 align:middle line:90%
links to lymph.

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.600 align:middle line:90%
Lymph links to the brain.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.870 align:middle line:84%
Brain links to all
emotional trauma.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
looking at this whole thing

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:14.170 align:middle line:90%
is connected.

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:14.970 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:17.595 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: It's not just like
you have some emotional trauma.

00:45:17.595 --> 00:45:19.250 align:middle line:84%
It's tied to--
everything's connected.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.667 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
beauty of Ayurveda.

00:45:20.667 --> 00:45:24.463 align:middle line:84%
It's the one system that really
ties it all together for you.

00:45:24.463 --> 00:45:26.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So instead of
trying to beat the system

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and then take out the parts that
aren't working because we're

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:30.370 align:middle line:84%
not doing very well at beating
the system, we're saying,

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:30.670 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:31.820 align:middle line:90%
The system isn't so bad.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's just get back
in touch with nature.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.032 align:middle line:90%
It has everything that we need.

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:37.080 align:middle line:84%
All we have to do is
reconnect, plug in.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And it not only allows
us to begin to detoxify,

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:43.480 align:middle line:84%
but sets us up for a greater
state of consciousness, which

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:46.180 align:middle line:84%
is available only after
we've got this system working

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the way that it's
supposed to-- which

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:48.100 align:middle line:90%
I know we're going to get into.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.017 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Exactly why
Ayurveda was created.

00:45:50.017 --> 00:45:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda was created because the
body was so dense and so toxic

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.590 align:middle line:84%
and so heavy, that we couldn't
experience the subtlety

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:57.590 align:middle line:90%
of our own conscious.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That's
why they did it.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:45:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And so-- love it.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So before we jump right
into that, let's just-- one

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:06.160 align:middle line:84%
last thing here,
because on this, I

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.050 align:middle line:84%
think it's very
important that people

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:10.870 align:middle line:84%
start to recognize that
sleep plays a role,

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:90%
meditation plays a role.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:14.533 align:middle line:84%
And can you just
tie together what

00:46:14.533 --> 00:46:15.700 align:middle line:90%
we were just speaking about?

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:19.570 align:middle line:84%
The lymphatic system, and
cleansing and detoxing that.

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:20.920 align:middle line:90%
How does that help for sleep?

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And has that set us up
for meditation or higher

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
consciousness or just being able
to think in more creative ways,

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:27.100 align:middle line:90%
instead of survival?

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:28.725 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well,
the science on sleep

00:46:28.725 --> 00:46:30.070 align:middle line:90%
is just so overwhelming.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:33.550 align:middle line:84%
If you don't get good sleep,
just about every health concern

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.480 align:middle line:84%
imaginable is linked
to poor sleep.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.680 align:middle line:84%
And what we now know
that when you sleep,

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.460 align:middle line:84%
the brain drains 3 pounds
of plaque and chemicals

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.200 align:middle line:84%
every year while
you sleep at night.

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
getting good sleep,

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.710 align:middle line:84%
what happens to
all those toxins?

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.900 align:middle line:84%
They just stay in your
brain, cause all types

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.860 align:middle line:84%
of potential issues-- brain
fog, cognitive decline,

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.480 align:middle line:90%
things like that.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So sleep is a critical
piece of the puzzle.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.467 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not moving
your body during the day

00:47:00.467 --> 00:47:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to get the big lymphs--
because your lymph system,

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.342 align:middle line:84%
when you move your
muscles, it pumps lymph.

00:47:04.342 --> 00:47:06.047 align:middle line:90%
That's waste out of your body.

00:47:06.047 --> 00:47:07.630 align:middle line:84%
So if we're sedentary
sitting all day,

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.560 align:middle line:84%
and we don't get the big lymphs
to move and they're congested,

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.690 align:middle line:84%
your rings are tight
on your fingers.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Your ankles swell.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.470 align:middle line:84%
You've got skin rashes
and you're breaking out.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.490 align:middle line:90%
And you're tired.

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Women, prior to their
menstrual cycle,

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.920 align:middle line:84%
there's a premenstrual
lymphatic detox

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that give the reproductive
organs a bit of a break.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:29.208 align:middle line:84%
So prior to your cycle, there's
a lymph detox that takes place.

00:47:29.208 --> 00:47:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But if your lymph's
congested, you're

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:33.720 align:middle line:84%
dumping reproductive fluid into
an already congested system,

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.550 align:middle line:90%
what happens?

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:35.967 align:middle line:84%
Your breasts swell,
become tender.

00:47:35.967 --> 00:47:39.570 align:middle line:84%
You feel PMS-ey, moody,
tired, break out.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:44.070 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote an article once
called "It May Not Be Hormonal"

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:46.860 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the symptoms
that women are experiencing

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:48.360 align:middle line:90%
aren't actually hormonal.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.890 align:middle line:90%
They're clogged drains.

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:51.540 align:middle line:90%
The lymph system's congested.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And we would give them an herb,
one herb called manjistha,

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:58.460 align:middle line:84%
and like 80% of my cases,
they were like, these women

00:47:58.460 --> 00:47:59.260 align:middle line:90%
would get better.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.220 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't a hormonal issue.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.640 align:middle line:90%
So again, the lymph has so--

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.520 align:middle line:84%
it's linked to so many
of our woes and things

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.920 align:middle line:84%
that we experienced and saw
how important it is for us

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.040 align:middle line:90%
to really understand that.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for tracking
that together for us.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important insights

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.550 align:middle line:84%
we can glean from Ayurveda
is the profound and subtle

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:21.530 align:middle line:84%
connection between
the mind and the body.

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:23.513 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:48:23.513 --> 00:48:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>PAUL DUGLISS:
Being a physician,

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I really understand that
many of the conditions that

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:32.520 align:middle line:84%
are prevalent in our
society are stress-related.

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.130 align:middle line:90%
Stress is a huge component.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:37.650 align:middle line:10%
And it's not something
that modern medicine really

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:40.280 align:middle line:10%
has very efficient
tools to work with.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.930 align:middle line:90%


00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.740 align:middle line:90%
Contrast that with Ayurveda.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Ayurveda understands
this intimate connection

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:49.860 align:middle line:90%
between mind and body.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:54.450 align:middle line:10%
It understands how emotions
and emotional perception

00:48:54.450 --> 00:49:00.150 align:middle line:10%
and the digestion of emotion
has an impact on our ability

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:06.300 align:middle line:10%
to either ward off stress,
to process it, digest it

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:11.730 align:middle line:10%
and not have it affect us, or
it will have an impact that

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.480 align:middle line:10%
is damaging and imbalancing.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how do we
digest what we call stress

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.320 align:middle line:90%
so that it isn't harmful?

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.160 align:middle line:90%


00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.310 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: You know,
I think fundamentally,

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:31.760 align:middle line:84%
it has to do with our
lifestyle and our routine.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:84%
When I teach doctors
Ayurveda, I always

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.970 align:middle line:84%
suggest the first question
you should ask your patients

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:42.680 align:middle line:84%
is, how do you feel between
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 o'clock

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.890 align:middle line:90%
in the afternoon?

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:47.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the Vata time of
the day, the nervous system

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.630 align:middle line:90%
time of the day.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:53.480 align:middle line:84%
So if you're crashing, burning,
craving Starbucks, chocolate,

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.550 align:middle line:84%
a stimulant or a nap
in that afternoon,

00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:90%
you've got no gas in your tank.

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.873 align:middle line:90%
And you're crashing.

00:49:59.873 --> 00:50:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And then you want to
stimulate yourself to get

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.290 align:middle line:90%
the energy that you need.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:07.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you crash, you
trigger a stress response.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
degenerative chemistry.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you stimulate
yourself to get energy.

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:15.865 align:middle line:84%
And then you usually
overshoot the runway,

00:50:15.865 --> 00:50:17.990 align:middle line:84%
which means you're going
to store the extra as fat.

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you crash and burn because
it's short-lived energy, right?

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.200 align:middle line:84%
When you crave stuff,
you're not craving--

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.130 align:middle line:84%
usually, people
aren't craving nuts.

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They're craving some
donut or some injection,

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.140 align:middle line:84%
a Snickers bar, or some dark
chocolate, or some coffee.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And that gives them
the up and down energy.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves them
exhausted and depleted.

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.460 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why people are
oftentimes out of balance

00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:43.310 align:middle line:84%
is because of how
we handle stress.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And the first golden rule is how
we live in sync or out of sync

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:50.450 align:middle line:90%
with those natural rhythms.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And that means in the middle of
the day, between around noon,

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:56.630 align:middle line:84%
studies are now
showing clearly, this

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is where we should eat our
biggest meal of the day.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
a full tank of gas

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.840 align:middle line:84%
to go in the afternoon
between 2:00 and 6:00

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:84%
when the brain's
saying, give me my fuel.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And I need 80% of the brain
fuel at this point in time.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:12.027 align:middle line:84%
But if you had
nothing for lunch,

00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:13.610 align:middle line:84%
or something in front
of your computer

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:15.710 align:middle line:84%
for lunch, or eating
it on the run for lunch

00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:17.570 align:middle line:84%
and it was not digested
properly because you

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.153 align:middle line:84%
had the fight-or-flight
system engaged

00:51:19.153 --> 00:51:22.340 align:middle line:84%
versus the parasympathetic
rest and digest system engaged,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.960 align:middle line:90%
that food didn't get delivered.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.920 align:middle line:90%
The brain didn't have any fuel.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The brain's coming and
saying, I need my fuel.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.510 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going to get it?

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.460 align:middle line:84%
You're going to borrow
from Peter to pay Paul.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:35.820 align:middle line:84%
One of those places, hormonally,
is women's progesterone,

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:39.120 align:middle line:84%
which converts directly into
cortisol, or stress hormone.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So now it depletes
their hormones.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And they have
reproductive issues.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.025 align:middle line:84%
The body will crave sugar and
affect blood sugar issues.

00:51:45.025 --> 00:51:47.150 align:middle line:84%
And then it'll go to your
thyroid and say, hey, you

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:48.740 align:middle line:90%
guys aren't doing anything.

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:51.270 align:middle line:84%
We need to up-regulate a
little metabolic activity.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:53.330 align:middle line:90%
So now the thyroid goes wonky.

00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And you start having issues
with having your thyroid

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:58.753 align:middle line:84%
or keeping your
energy levels go.

00:51:58.753 --> 00:52:00.170 align:middle line:84%
So the body will
borrow from Peter

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to pay Paul to make it happen
and deplete you along the way.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.947 align:middle line:84%
The story I told earlier,
the one with the goiter,

00:52:05.947 --> 00:52:07.280 align:middle line:90%
she had burned out her adrenals.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.400 align:middle line:84%
She had burned out her
reproductive issues.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.520 align:middle line:90%
She had blood sugar issues.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:16.670 align:middle line:84%
She went through all those, then
finally, her thyroid exploded.

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:18.250 align:middle line:84%
She went through
the entire gamut

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:19.708 align:middle line:84%
and was able to
repair and rebuild.

00:52:19.708 --> 00:52:22.140 align:middle line:84%
That's the cool thing, is
the body is so repairable.

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:22.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid was trying to do
a job it wasn't built to do.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And so it was compromised
because of the whole chain

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:30.170 align:middle line:90%
reaction, all because--

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.170 align:middle line:84%
as you found through starting
the cleansing process--

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.420 align:middle line:84%
she was then able
to recognize, whoa,

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.360 align:middle line:90%
there was a trauma in my life.

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.737 align:middle line:84%
The psychological impact that
changed my life thereafter,

00:52:40.737 --> 00:52:42.320 align:middle line:84%
which I haven't even
been remembering.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.440 align:middle line:90%
I haven't even been aware of it.

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I've just been
compensating for it.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.940 align:middle line:84%
So speak to us about
Ayurvedic psychology.

00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Bridge those worlds for us.

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:10%
>>DOUILLARD: Ayurvedic
psychology is realizing that we

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.690 align:middle line:10%
are--

00:52:55.690 --> 00:53:00.380 align:middle line:10%
that 95% of the things that we
think and say and do as adults

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.330 align:middle line:10%
come from impressions
that we all experience

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:04.260 align:middle line:10%
in the first six years of life.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So we are living, having
this discussion pretty much

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:10.190 align:middle line:90%
unconscious.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.090 align:middle line:84%
Because if 95% of stuff we're
saying and thinking about

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:15.740 align:middle line:84%
are coming from
those impressions,

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.080 align:middle line:84%
that's just an
amazing statistic.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And most of us are walking
around unconscious.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic psychology--
Ayurveda, in general--

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.280 align:middle line:84%
was really about
becoming conscious.

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And there's an aspect of
the Vedas called Dhanurveda.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Dhaner, the Dhanurasana
of the Bow Asana.

00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:32.210 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with
pulling back the bow.

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And the golden four
words in Vedic science

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.450 align:middle line:84%
are establish being
and perform action,

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:44.120 align:middle line:84%
or what's called
Yogastha Kuru Karmani.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.530 align:middle line:90%
You pull back the bow.

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:47.450 align:middle line:90%
You establish being.

00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:48.710 align:middle line:90%
You take aim.

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:50.390 align:middle line:90%
You hold it really still.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And you take action
from that deep place

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.260 align:middle line:90%
of inner peace and calm.

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:56.450 align:middle line:84%
If I'm holding the arrow
and I'm moving it around,

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:57.710 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea what
I'm going to hit.

00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:58.590 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be dangerous.

00:53:58.590 --> 00:53:59.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It could go anywhere.

00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's exponentially
distorted,

00:54:01.070 --> 00:54:02.730 align:middle line:90%
if I'm moving this thing around.

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But if I establish being
and then take action

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and take action from
that place of silence,

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:10.160 align:middle line:90%
it's transformational.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.700 align:middle line:84%
It's a karmic
transformational action.

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:18.130 align:middle line:84%
So the point of Vedic science
is for us to still our body.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.340 align:middle line:90%
Establish being.

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, breathing,
meditation, living in sync

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:24.305 align:middle line:84%
with the natural
cycles, going downstream

00:54:24.305 --> 00:54:25.430 align:middle line:90%
with the current of nature.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Being still.

00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.110 align:middle line:90%
Being in nature.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:30.140 align:middle line:84%
Restore the silence, the
awareness, and appreciation

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.620 align:middle line:90%
of inner space.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And then from that clarity,
bring the body back

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:35.390 align:middle line:90%
into balance.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.190 align:middle line:90%
Vata, Pitta, Kapha.

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Bring the body digestion
back into balance.

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.420 align:middle line:84%
You become more clear of old
mental emotional patterns

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.610 align:middle line:84%
of behavior you created
as a young child,

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:46.340 align:middle line:84%
that helped you greatly at
that point in your life--

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.360 align:middle line:84%
but as adults, oftentimes,
are not serving you.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.020 align:middle line:84%
You go home for the
holidays and you're

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.020 align:middle line:84%
watching your mom and
dad, or sister or brothers

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:55.230 align:middle line:90%
trigger you like crazy.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're actually a
four-year-old again.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, well, where do
these emotions come from?

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:02.300 align:middle line:84%
They're stored memories of
stress in your fat cells

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.210 align:middle line:84%
that remotely make you think
and do the same dumb stuff again

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:06.030 align:middle line:90%
and again.

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.990 align:middle line:84%
But as you become more still and
more self-aware, you then see,

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:13.470 align:middle line:84%
oh, that's what's
happening here.

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you see that not
just is there a door number

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.440 align:middle line:84%
one, the old pattern of doing
the same dumb thing again

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:19.500 align:middle line:90%
and again and again.

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.740 align:middle line:84%
You begin to see
there's door number two.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:26.210 align:middle line:84%
I can-- instead of reacting
to their situation,

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:30.190 align:middle line:84%
I can start to react
based on my truth, which

00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:33.370 align:middle line:84%
is to be loving and
joyful and kind.

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's the trick.

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:36.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the beauty
of self-awareness.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:39.490 align:middle line:84%
But what most people don't
get is the Vedic prescription

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:43.420 align:middle line:84%
was establish being and
then perform action.

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't Yoga, breathe,
meditate, and go lie, cheat,

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:47.260 align:middle line:90%
and steal on your life.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:52.630 align:middle line:84%
You have to follow it up
with real, tangible actions.

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Like, if your mom is telling
you, making you irritated,

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.770 align:middle line:84%
you have to start
to realize that I

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:02.530 align:middle line:84%
can react to her stress,
which is her desire

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:03.790 align:middle line:90%
to have me love her--

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:04.947 align:middle line:90%
which isn't really her.

00:56:04.947 --> 00:56:06.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a protective
pattern she created,

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:07.600 align:middle line:90%
which isn't really her.

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reacting to a version
of her that's not really her,

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.490 align:middle line:84%
right, with the version of
me that's not really me.

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:14.157 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm reacting
to a version of her

00:56:14.157 --> 00:56:15.370 align:middle line:90%
which isn't really her.

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So none of us are really
communicating heart-to-heart.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.960 align:middle line:84%
So Ayurveda was like, we
can become more self-aware.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Look at this game that
the mind has created

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:27.010 align:middle line:90%
to keep you safe and secure.

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:29.140 align:middle line:90%
And we can bypass that.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:32.560 align:middle line:84%
We can hack that by letting
ourselves take actions that

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:35.320 align:middle line:84%
are a little more vulnerable,
a little bit more delicate,

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.390 align:middle line:90%
by acting on what's really true.

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:38.260 align:middle line:90%
I love my mom.

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.530 align:middle line:84%
She's crazy and
nutty, but I love her.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:41.620 align:middle line:90%
And I care about her.

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.160 align:middle line:84%
What if I acted on those
things versus reacting

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.920 align:middle line:84%
to the things about
her that I don't like?

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:49.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a simple shift
in taking action

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.600 align:middle line:84%
based on what's real
versus on what's not real.

00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Puts us in a
state of creatorship,

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:58.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than just trying to be
a better survivor or reactor.

00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.210 align:middle line:84%
It allows us to experience
ourselves as, really,

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:02.770 align:middle line:90%
the creatures that we are.

00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And healing and wholeness
of life uncommon

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:09.390 align:middle line:84%
follows suit once
we take that stand.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:10.210 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah.

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:11.752 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I love the
focused positioning

00:57:11.752 --> 00:57:13.000 align:middle line:90%
before you take action.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they focus,
and the action

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.520 align:middle line:84%
can be reflective of one thing
instead of two separate things

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.820 align:middle line:84%
that have us bouncing off
the walls with each other.

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.327 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Like, roses were--

00:57:23.327 --> 00:57:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I have no idea if
this is true or not.

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:28.760 align:middle line:84%
But roses were, at one
point, didn't have thorns.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.220 align:middle line:90%
And they were edible.

00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.530 align:middle line:90%
Everybody trampled them.

00:57:31.530 --> 00:57:33.180 align:middle line:84%
The pricker bushes
never got trampled.

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:36.620 align:middle line:84%
And the roses were
like, it was too much.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:39.540 align:middle line:84%
So one of them said, what
if we just grew some thorns

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:40.540 align:middle line:90%
like the pricker bushes.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.690 align:middle line:90%
They'd stop trampling us.

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:42.847 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't eat us.

00:57:42.847 --> 00:57:43.930 align:middle line:90%
It was a big thing, right?

00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:45.528 align:middle line:90%
So they took a vote.

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:46.570 align:middle line:90%
And they voted on thorns.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.237 align:middle line:84%
We'll put them under the leaves,
then no one will notice, right?

00:57:49.237 --> 00:57:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, they ended
up having thorns.

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And when people are trampled in
their life over a long period

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.290 align:middle line:90%
of time, they grow thorns.

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:57.910 align:middle line:84%
So what they project
into the world

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:59.710 align:middle line:84%
is sometimes some
thorny behavior,

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:02.320 align:middle line:90%
which isn't so easy to love.

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But when you realize,
through awareness,

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:08.230 align:middle line:84%
that they're just
a rose with thorns,

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.510 align:middle line:84%
and instead of judging
them or pushing away--

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.360 align:middle line:84%
or if they throw a dart at
you, throw a dart back--

00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.420 align:middle line:84%
you realize that that's
just me reacting to them.

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:17.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing them.

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:19.207 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But
what if I did me?

00:58:19.207 --> 00:58:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And the science is clear.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.680 align:middle line:84%
When we love, give,
care, and help

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.780 align:middle line:84%
others, our telomeres--
which are based

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.490 align:middle line:90%
on our longevity-- lengthen.

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:30.610 align:middle line:84%
We produce the longevity
hormone, oxytocin.

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.670 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetically, when
we give from our heart,

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:35.620 align:middle line:90%
it changes the genetic code.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:37.760 align:middle line:84%
If I give you a gift
and I hope you like it,

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.790 align:middle line:90%
it's called hedonistic giving.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.890 align:middle line:84%
If I give you a gift and
I don't care if you like,

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I just fell in love with
giving you this gift,

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.970 align:middle line:90%
it's called eunomic giving.

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Eunomic giving literally
changes the genetic code

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.793 align:middle line:90%
in a positive way.

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.210 align:middle line:84%
When I give you a
gift and I'm not

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:56.440 align:middle line:84%
expecting anything in return,
your genes can feel it,

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:58.155 align:middle line:90%
can feel the difference.

00:58:58.155 --> 00:59:00.280 align:middle line:84%
For me, like, having a
little hook, do you like it?

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.155 align:middle line:90%
Is it the right size?

00:59:01.155 --> 00:59:02.770 align:middle line:84%
Am I getting some
juice out of it?

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:04.630 align:middle line:84%
That's the other
half of the equation.

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Establish being, perform
action, and the other half is

00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:11.260 align:middle line:84%
don't be attached to the
fruits of your actions.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:12.730 align:middle line:90%
It's tricky stuff.

00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:14.450 align:middle line:90%
It's the game of life.

00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:16.990 align:middle line:84%
But when you realize
that you're constantly

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:20.448 align:middle line:84%
needing all that approval and
appreciation of everybody else,

00:59:20.448 --> 00:59:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and you realize when and where
that's happening in your life,

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:25.690 align:middle line:84%
that's when you take
action to free yourself

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:27.270 align:middle line:90%
from those old patterns.

00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And the fruit ripens on
the tree in sequence.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.360 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
do it all at once.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.260 align:middle line:90%
It's too much.

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.840 align:middle line:90%
So you just chip away in life.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And you realize in
this relationship,

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.790 align:middle line:84%
in this relationship,
I can do better.

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:39.640 align:middle line:90%
I can be me.

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.335 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to react to them.

00:59:41.335 --> 00:59:43.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we have this
beautiful conversation

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.150 align:middle line:84%
about being the creator,
being the impetus of your life

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:48.970 align:middle line:84%
experience to the degree
that it can change your very

00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:51.890 align:middle line:84%
genetic coding, your DNA,
your expression-- therefore,

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:52.910 align:middle line:90%
of course, your health.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you express disease
in your life or not,

00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:58.330 align:middle line:84%
or if you have vitality
in your world--

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.300 align:middle line:84%
all through the power of
thought and focusing our mind.

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And we have another
conversation about nutrition

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.070 align:middle line:84%
and changing how
we eat, and what

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:08.320 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to outrun
there-- and dropping

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.050 align:middle line:84%
into circadian eating
and allowing nature

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:13.210 align:middle line:90%
to be a guide for us.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:14.770 align:middle line:90%
Where would one start?

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And I know that it's
neither this nor that.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:18.880 align:middle line:90%
But where would you suggest?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Someone's watching this.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
They're like, whoa, lots
of fantastic information.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Where do I begin?

01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Do I begin changing
my ability to embrace

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.030 align:middle line:84%
and to be loving and giving and
more unconditional in my life?

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Do I start with my eating and
assessing what's happening?

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Couple of things.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Get out in nature
as much as you can.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.500 align:middle line:84%
When you eat your food,
stop, take time, and relax.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%
And eat your food, you know?

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Do your very best to
eat the best quality

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.720 align:middle line:90%
food that you can eat.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And then be a little more
conscious in your interactions

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:59.320 align:middle line:90%
with other people.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And try to take what I call
random acts of kindness--

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:04.870 align:middle line:90%
little, like, hey.

01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:06.318 align:middle line:90%
Just thinking about you today.

01:01:06.318 --> 01:01:07.610 align:middle line:90%
Hope you're having a great day.

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
A text, a note, just a little
bit of love goes a long way.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times, I ask
my students oftentimes, like,

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:19.617 align:middle line:84%
how many of you
have a relationship?

01:01:19.617 --> 01:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And how many of you
love your partner?

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.630 align:middle line:90%
And they're all, yes, we do.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:24.380 align:middle line:84%
How many of you find
yourself holding back

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.460 align:middle line:90%
loving your partner?

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And they all raise
their hand like--

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And I go like, why do you hold
back loving someone that you

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.200 align:middle line:90%
truly just said you love?

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.560 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Bargaining, negotiating.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.360 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:36.677 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind is
all about mathematics.

01:01:36.677 --> 01:01:39.010 align:middle line:84%
You know, if I give you a
birthday present for 20 bucks,

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and you give me one
from the dollar store,

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.700 align:middle line:90%
my mind goes, you owe me $19.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do whatever
it takes to get my $19 back.

01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And that means I'm not going to
love you that much for a while.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
Or, I'm just not
going to show you.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:50.800 align:middle line:84%
You're passive
aggressive, or something.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:51.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do something.

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And that emotion that we created
as a result of feeling slighted

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:55.900 align:middle line:90%
goes into my fat.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's stored as a memory.

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I consciously react based
on that old protective stress.

01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So we have to become
more self-aware

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and go, wow, that's
what I'm doing.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:10.420 align:middle line:84%
How can I start acting on
something more truthful?

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And that starts with just
random acts of kindness.

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.365 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
get good at that

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and you start laying down some
neural pavement your brain

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.157 align:middle line:84%
to say it's OK to give and to
love, and to care, and to be

01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:22.780 align:middle line:84%
kind-- and just to do the
random act of kindness thing,

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:26.410 align:middle line:84%
you can start to respond to
feelings of being afflicted

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.550 align:middle line:90%
with affection.

01:02:27.550 --> 01:02:28.990 align:middle line:84%
So when they throw
a dart at you,

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
you realize that they're just
a rose that had been trampled.

01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Let it go by, and we
respond with compassion

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.893 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
game changer.

01:02:37.893 --> 01:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Simple
things, like, I know

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:40.480 align:middle line:90%
you didn't really mean that.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
you really do care.

01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And even though I understand
that you're upset right now,

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.197 align:middle line:84%
but I know that's
not who you are.

01:02:45.197 --> 01:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Just that recognition
changes the game

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:48.920 align:middle line:90%
for someone in an instant.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:49.270 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Completely.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Seemingly
impossible to change

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.785 align:middle line:84%
such a hot dynamic situation
with a simple, loving response.

01:02:55.785 --> 01:02:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: But if we don't
train ourselves to pull back

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
the bow and become
more still, we're

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:02.680 align:middle line:84%
just lost in the stimulation
of the mind, which

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
is all about needing to
be appreciated, approved

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:07.800 align:middle line:84%
of, and loved and cared
for by the outside world.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.963 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't get
that feeling from you,

01:03:09.963 --> 01:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to
figure out a way

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.680 align:middle line:90%
to get that feeling from you.

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And that means I'm
going to manipulate you.

01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to know
I'm manipulating you.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:17.768 align:middle line:84%
And that's not going
to feel good to you.

01:03:17.768 --> 01:03:20.620 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to react to
me based on some resentment

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.472 align:middle line:90%
from me manipulating you.

01:03:22.472 --> 01:03:23.560 align:middle line:90%
The world goes on, right?

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.780 align:middle line:84%
We drop bombs on countries
because of that kind of stuff.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we have, in
the interpersonal world,

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:31.490 align:middle line:90%
the divorce rate, what it is.

01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And suicide, where it is, and
this feeling of hopelessness

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.710 align:middle line:90%
and lack of self.

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's all stemming
from exactly what

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:42.500 align:middle line:90%
we're speaking about here.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.300 align:middle line:90%
So we can turn it.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.200 align:middle line:90%
We can change it.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.758 align:middle line:84%
And it's right here in front
of us to take, to have.

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.050 align:middle line:90%
All we have to do is accept it.

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: I told my
kids, I was talking to them.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.790 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've worked with
Deepak for many years.

01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of his original
famous quotes was--

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:55.675 align:middle line:90%
I was telling my kids this.

01:03:55.675 --> 01:03:58.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you know that
the space inside your cells

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
is proportionally as void
as intergalactic space?

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:04.830 align:middle line:90%
And they're like, what?

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
I go, and you guys
aren't even interested

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:08.710 align:middle line:90%
in intergalactic space.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:11.732 align:middle line:84%
You're just interested in
the space around your house

01:04:11.732 --> 01:04:13.690 align:middle line:84%
or in your life, in your
cell phone-- whatever.

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.523 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We don't even
think about that stuff.

01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: What about
the inner space, you know?

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
I just feel like we need
to encourage it and create

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:23.380 align:middle line:90%
some attraction.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.910 align:middle line:84%
We need to put some bait
in the inner space world

01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:middle line:84%
to get people to realize it's
so much more fascinating.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is so much
more distracting

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and temporary than turning the
pendulum swing to come back

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.980 align:middle line:90%
to something that's more real.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I think it's got to
happen soon, because I

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:44.687 align:middle line:84%
can't think the pendulum can
go too further off the chart--

01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Into dispersal
and distraction.

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Exactly.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that it is
making a turn just because

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.530 align:middle line:84%
of the crazy that our culture
is experiencing right now.

01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:54.780 align:middle line:90%
People are starting to search.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.470 align:middle line:90%
Like, what do I do differently?

01:04:56.470 --> 01:05:00.310 align:middle line:84%
This is maddening, what
we're living in as a culture.

01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps hope
is on the horizon.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.072 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: I think so.

01:05:04.072 --> 01:05:05.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Quantum
science has given us

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
new insights about the
nature of our reality

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and the subtle
power of intention

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.620 align:middle line:90%
within the physical universe.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look
at what is known

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:16.900 align:middle line:84%
as the observer effect,
explained by Dr. Theresa

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.547 align:middle line:90%
Bullard.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:20.130 align:middle line:10%
>>THERESA BULLARD:
In quantum physics,

01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:23.400 align:middle line:10%
we talk about there being many
simultaneous possibilities

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.910 align:middle line:10%
and probabilities
all existing at once.

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.980 align:middle line:10%
Until a measurement,
or observation--

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:30.780 align:middle line:10%
a.k.a.

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.000 align:middle line:10%
a choice is made.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000 align:middle line:10%
Now upon observation, one
of those possibilities

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.520 align:middle line:10%
will manifest out while,
the others will disappear.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.400 align:middle line:10%
This is known as
the observer effect

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.830 align:middle line:10%
and collapsing the wave form.

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:46.680 align:middle line:10%
How was this observer
effect discovered?

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.320 align:middle line:10%
It relates to another
aspect of complementarity

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.350 align:middle line:10%
known as wave particle duality.

01:05:52.350 --> 01:05:54.690 align:middle line:10%
In the early days of
quantum discovery,

01:05:54.690 --> 01:05:57.330 align:middle line:10%
it began with scientists
trying to understand

01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:59.310 align:middle line:10%
the nature of light.

01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:00.450 align:middle line:10%
Is it a wave?

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:02.370 align:middle line:10%
Or is it a particle?

01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:05.850 align:middle line:10%
It turns out, light
displays both behaviors.

01:06:05.850 --> 01:06:10.260 align:middle line:10%
Now this confronted scientists
with a mystery or paradox.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:14.120 align:middle line:10%
How can light be both
a wave and a particle?

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.530 align:middle line:10%
The paradigm at the time
said it must be either

01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:19.470 align:middle line:10%
or, not both and.

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:21.570 align:middle line:10%
And the mystery
grew when scientists

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:25.680 align:middle line:10%
began to wonder whether matter
also could behave as both wave

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.850 align:middle line:10%
and particle.

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.840 align:middle line:10%
And indeed, it could.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.530 align:middle line:10%
There have been many
indications and new discoveries

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:34.750 align:middle line:10%
in quantum physics that
have confirmed all of this.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:38.520 align:middle line:10%
Now to make a long story short,
if they set up the experiment

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.890 align:middle line:10%
to see if it's a
wave, then indeed,

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:42.690 align:middle line:10%
they get wave-like behavior.

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:44.220 align:middle line:10%
But if they set
up the experiment

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:46.680 align:middle line:10%
to try and observe
it as a particle,

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.470 align:middle line:10%
then the behavior changes
to that of a particle.

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.780 align:middle line:10%
It's all about how
the scientists choose

01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:55.020 align:middle line:10%
to set up their observation
or measurement points.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:57.330 align:middle line:10%
Now what's
fascinating is that it

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:01.930 align:middle line:10%
is as if the quanta are aware
that they're being observed.

01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:05.280 align:middle line:10%
The very act of observing
has a dramatic effect

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.750 align:middle line:10%
on their behavior.

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:09.930 align:middle line:10%
It is a real phenomenon.

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So basically, we
create what we're looking for.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:16.290 align:middle line:84%
It generates in the
presence of our observation.

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
This is related to work
that you're doing currently.

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:22.470 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain about
your recent work

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:25.100 align:middle line:90%
on Ayurvedic psychology?

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Absolutely.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:30.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm so fascinated
by quantum physics

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:36.820 align:middle line:84%
because it so directly
describes Vedic science.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.960 align:middle line:84%
And in Ayurveda, there's a term
for the cause of all disease,

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.490 align:middle line:84%
and it's called the
mistake of the intellect,

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
where the intellect--
or in Vedic science,

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.650 align:middle line:84%
called pragya-aparadh, which is
the mistake of the intellect.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.900 align:middle line:84%
The intellect starts
to think of itself

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:56.100 align:middle line:84%
as separate from the underlying
field of consciousness

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.050 align:middle line:90%
from which we came.

01:07:58.050 --> 01:08:03.030 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Unified Field theories
now are pretty conclusive,

01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:06.540 align:middle line:84%
in that the field that
everything comes from

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.000 align:middle line:90%
is intelligent.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.460 align:middle line:90%
It's informed.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.980 align:middle line:84%
There's something intelligent,
godlike, superior,

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.770 align:middle line:90%
supreme intelligence about that.

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:22.109 align:middle line:84%
So Ayurvedic medicine says
that the cause of disease

01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:25.109 align:middle line:84%
takes place right at
the junction point

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:29.250 align:middle line:84%
where the field of
intelligence becomes matter.

01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:31.282 align:middle line:84%
And the matter
forgets that it's part

01:08:31.282 --> 01:08:32.490 align:middle line:90%
of the field of intelligence.

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It's the loss of memory
of pure consciousness.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We start functioning
as parts, as opposed

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.060 align:middle line:90%
to the sum of the parts.

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.310 align:middle line:84%
The whole is greater than
the sum of the parts, right?

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:42.630 align:middle line:90%
We all have heard that.

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So when the parts start
to function independently

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.979 align:middle line:84%
from the whole,
they lose the memory

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:48.550 align:middle line:84%
of how to work as
part of the system.

01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:49.350 align:middle line:90%
They become rogue.

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:50.392 align:middle line:90%
They become cancer cells.

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Bad things happen.

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:52.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the cause.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
That was predicted as the cause
of disease thousands of years

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.810 align:middle line:90%
ago.

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So now we know that Vedic
science said that if you could

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:07.200 align:middle line:84%
put your attention at the
junction point between

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:11.887 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and matter, where
the matter forgot that it was

01:09:11.887 --> 01:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
consciousness-- and you could
put yourself right at that

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.510 align:middle line:90%
junction point--

01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:17.340 align:middle line:84%
you could then be
aware and restore

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.279 align:middle line:84%
the memory of pure
consciousness into the matter.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:22.338 align:middle line:84%
If I was living in
the consciousness,

01:09:22.338 --> 01:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
access to the matter.

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.220 align:middle line:84%
If I'm living in the matter,
I wouldn't have access

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.160 align:middle line:90%
to the consciousness.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.130 align:middle line:84%
But if I could stick myself
right at the junction point,

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
I would be like a lamp
at the door, right?

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:33.350 align:middle line:90%
Shine both ways.

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:34.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

01:09:34.150 --> 01:09:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: That's what
all Vedic healing was about.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, breathing, meditation,
they're all designed to still

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:43.140 align:middle line:84%
you to bring your
attention-- touch therapies,

01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.520 align:middle line:90%
pulse diagnosis--

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:46.680 align:middle line:84%
all designed to
bring your attention

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.649 align:middle line:84%
to the junction point between
consciousness and matter.

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:51.840 align:middle line:90%
And now, guess what?

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.630 align:middle line:84%
We have these things
called photons,

01:09:54.630 --> 01:10:00.210 align:middle line:84%
which are, by definition,
consciousness field and matter,

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:02.380 align:middle line:90%
or field and physiology.

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
things called photons,

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
which are literally the junction
point between consciousness

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:07.850 align:middle line:90%
and matter.

01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
And that's indisputable.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.003 align:middle line:84%
We also now have new
science to suggest

01:10:11.003 --> 01:10:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that there are
these things called

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
biophotons, which
you and I receive

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:17.880 align:middle line:90%
and transmit all day long.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And the science suggests
that these biophotons

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.240 align:middle line:90%
live in our DNA.

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.420 align:middle line:84%
And they're
information-carrying molecules--

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.580 align:middle line:90%
particles, or wave forms--

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
that carry information at
great distances within our body

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and without our body
at the speed of light.

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:37.380 align:middle line:84%
Einstein called it spooky
action at a distance,

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that if I observe
something here,

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:45.270 align:middle line:84%
it can change something light
years away instantaneously.

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And these are photons that
he was describing, which she

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.460 align:middle line:90%
was describing on the video.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
We now know that--
this is crazy, right--

01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:57.240 align:middle line:84%
that these biophotons
are affected and changed

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.610 align:middle line:90%
by our intention.

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And we know that they
live at the junction

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
point between
consciousness and matter,

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.770 align:middle line:84%
where Ayurveda said that
was the cause of disease.

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:06.812 align:middle line:84%
That's where it takes
place, right at that point.

01:11:06.812 --> 01:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you could bring your
attention to that point,

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.620 align:middle line:84%
you can shine the consciousness,
the light into the physiology

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.510 align:middle line:84%
and restore the memory
of pure consciousness

01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:17.370 align:middle line:90%
and actually heal disease.

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is what
the biophotons can do.

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:24.210 align:middle line:84%
This explains distance
healing, prayer,

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:27.690 align:middle line:84%
healing in the body at the
deepest fundamental level

01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:30.940 align:middle line:84%
with spontaneous remissions,
the placebo effect--

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
which is 82% effective,
35 to 82% effective.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.510 align:middle line:84%
No one understands
how it can work.

01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:39.810 align:middle line:84%
It works-- they think,
the mechanism, we think--

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:43.530 align:middle line:84%
they think, have figured out
what the mechanism for this is,

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:46.140 align:middle line:84%
which is understanding
that these biophotons are

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.020 align:middle line:90%
charged with our own intention.

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're
information-carrying particles

01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:53.300 align:middle line:84%
that carry information
with inside of us,

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
are establishing awareness
of field in physiology

01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
or consciousness,
and that of restoring

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.170 align:middle line:84%
the memory of pure conscious
within our own body.

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But because these happen
at the speed of light

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
at great distances, they can
happen at great distances.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.680 align:middle line:84%
And if I was praying for
you or a family member,

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:13.290 align:middle line:84%
that if I did it the right
way with the right type

01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:14.910 align:middle line:90%
of attention--

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
intention-- we could actually
elicit a healing response,

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:20.250 align:middle line:84%
which is why many of
the studies on prayer

01:12:20.250 --> 01:12:21.900 align:middle line:90%
seem to work amazingly well.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.580 align:middle line:90%
Some of the studies don't.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And I would sure
to say that it has

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:28.110 align:middle line:84%
something to do
with the intention

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.610 align:middle line:90%
and how it was delivered.

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Was there an attachment to
the return on the investment

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.140 align:middle line:90%
of that intention?

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.250 align:middle line:90%
Or was it just--

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: --completely
unconditional.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know that.

01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:39.953 align:middle line:90%
That's sort of like, the future.

01:12:39.953 --> 01:12:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I've
been writing about.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:44.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's just so amazing
to me that what quantum--

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:46.950 align:middle line:84%
what she was describing was
what Vedi science talked

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.853 align:middle line:90%
about thousands of years ago.

01:12:49.853 --> 01:12:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're beginning to see
that that can bear truth.

01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So if we're dialing
into a frequency that is

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.460 align:middle line:84%
the frequency, that is
foundational to everything

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.720 align:middle line:90%
in the material world--

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.650 align:middle line:84%
everything in the
manifest world that--

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.920 align:middle line:84%
and it happens at this
level of the mind field

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.500 align:middle line:84%
where we're starting to
compress that information

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.570 align:middle line:84%
and get it stuck in
certain patterns, which

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:middle line:90%
lead to disease.

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Or, opening it to possibility
and transformative patterns

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.570 align:middle line:84%
that are available to
be different than they

01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:19.680 align:middle line:90%
were a minute ago.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And thereby, allowing
a flow and healing

01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:26.390 align:middle line:90%
and wholeness to restore.

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:29.260 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And initiate,
I think, just an awareness--

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.925 align:middle line:84%
awareness of, oh,
there's door number two.

01:13:31.925 --> 01:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to do the dumb
thing again, and again,

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:34.850 align:middle line:90%
and again.

01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:37.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing it in a way--
and we all done that.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:38.680 align:middle line:90%
We're all like, oh, wow.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I somehow, for
whatever reason, I'm

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.270 align:middle line:84%
looking at this problem
in a different way.

01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:43.603 align:middle line:90%
And now I can solve the problem.

01:13:43.603 --> 01:13:45.240 align:middle line:84%
I think Einstein
said, when you're

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
trying to solve a problem
with a technology that

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:53.520 align:middle line:84%
was existed with how the
problem started, is crazy.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
But if we could actually
use a different technology,

01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:57.490 align:middle line:90%
we can solve the problem.

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.198 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what we're doing here,

01:13:59.198 --> 01:14:03.660 align:middle line:84%
is we're solving the problem
by enhancing awareness, which

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.640 align:middle line:84%
gives us an opportunity
to look at door number

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.310 align:middle line:84%
two versus the old door
number one-- which has

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:10.110 align:middle line:90%
four lanes with lights on it.

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:11.520 align:middle line:84%
We've been driving
it down, down,

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.470 align:middle line:84%
down that road our entire life,
doing the same thing again

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:15.270 align:middle line:90%
and again.

01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:16.645 align:middle line:84%
And now we've
started to realize,

01:14:16.645 --> 01:14:21.900 align:middle line:84%
wow, I really can change
old patterns of behavior

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
and give myself
permission to be loving,

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
to be joyful, to be kind, to be
content, as opposed to needing

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:29.970 align:middle line:84%
all that attention, and
manipulating the world

01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:31.070 align:middle line:90%
to get that attention.

01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.870 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
And so allowing us
to start to recognize

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
that we have a chance of
changing our environment,

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:45.310 align:middle line:84%
changing our experiencing in it,
and it's going to feel better.

01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:47.400 align:middle line:84%
One of the ways that I
like to encourage people

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to know that they're
dialing into this higher

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
frequency, this higher
level of consciousness,

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.590 align:middle line:90%
is that it feels better.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:54.630 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to
feel better when

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.950 align:middle line:84%
you're operating from the
place that you're describing.

01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's a way for people
to monitor how they're

01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:02.305 align:middle line:84%
doing, if they're progressing--
if they feel better

01:15:02.305 --> 01:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
about the giving, if they feel
better about the thoughts,

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.982 align:middle line:84%
if it feels better
in their physiology.

01:15:06.982 --> 01:15:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Like
you said earlier,

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.750 align:middle line:84%
something about when
you're driving by,

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:10.583 align:middle line:90%
you look at a plant.

01:15:10.583 --> 01:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
You can look at it in
two different ways.

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like with everything.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was watching a
video of a yogi giving himself

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
an Ayurvedic
massage, an abhyanga.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.660 align:middle line:90%
And I was so taken by--

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.370 align:middle line:84%
he was giving
himself this massage.

01:15:23.370 --> 01:15:25.662 align:middle line:84%
He was giving a lecture while
he was massaging himself.

01:15:25.662 --> 01:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
But he was loving his
leg with such affection,

01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I was like, couldn't
stop looking at that,

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:32.590 align:middle line:84%
going like, I've
never given myself

01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:34.860 align:middle line:84%
a massage with that kind
of love and affection.

01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm just like rub, rub, rub,
get the oil on, you know?

01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

01:15:37.610 --> 01:15:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Get the job done.

01:15:38.010 --> 01:15:39.635 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: And I
was like, oh my god.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
whole thing is about.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It's the attention.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It's the intention when
you're doing your yoga,

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.880 align:middle line:84%
the intention to
become more still--

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.500 align:middle line:90%
not just get into the form.

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
When you're meditating, that
subtle intention-- when you're

01:15:52.710 --> 01:15:55.170 align:middle line:84%
caring for another
person or giving love,

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
it's that subtle intention
of giving yourself

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
permission to give it with
a little bit more sincerity,

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:07.410 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more palpable
awareness of the process

01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:09.273 align:middle line:90%
of your actions in the giving.

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:11.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, I think that that's
really valuable for our viewers

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:12.740 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, people have
a difficult time accessing

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.040 align:middle line:90%
self-love.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And they get this pressure
that you have to love yourself.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:22.365 align:middle line:84%
And really, all we're
saying is that you're just

01:16:22.365 --> 01:16:23.490 align:middle line:90%
providing this information.

01:16:23.490 --> 01:16:27.090 align:middle line:84%
That just being
intentional and being kind,

01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and being nurturing to the
self, just your very presence

01:16:30.690 --> 01:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is all that's required
for this to unfold.

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>>DOUILLARD: Right.

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And feeling loved gives us
permission to love, right?

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.620 align:middle line:84%
We feel safe to let
the petals open.

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it
can really start.

01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We think we all need to be
loved and we need self-love.

01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:52.530 align:middle line:84%
The sun doesn't get
anything in return.

01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.270 align:middle line:90%
It just shines, right?

01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:56.880 align:middle line:84%
And fundamentally, that's what
we're really trying to get to,

01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:00.240 align:middle line:84%
a place where I feel safe
enough to give a little,

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.080 align:middle line:84%
to love a little, to care
for another little bit more,

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to realize
I'm so exhausted,

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:06.230 align:middle line:90%
I just need, need, need, need.

01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:07.030 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.710 align:middle line:90%
I get that.

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.360 align:middle line:84%
And we need lifestyle
and diet and digestion,

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and all that, to
get that better.

01:17:10.890 --> 01:17:14.400 align:middle line:84%
But soon as you have a
little glimmer of energy,

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.490 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of love is
what will truly fill us

01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:19.170 align:middle line:90%
up and charge our battery.

01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:23.940 align:middle line:84%
It's not self-loving, as much as
it is being the love as opposed

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.540 align:middle line:90%
to needing love.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.252 align:middle line:90%
So self-love is great.

01:17:28.252 --> 01:17:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's definitely
a time and a place

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.418 align:middle line:84%
where you have to
care for yourself

01:17:31.418 --> 01:17:34.780 align:middle line:84%
to create the stillness to have
the self-awareness, clearly.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:40.000 align:middle line:84%
But the action step is what
the sun does, gives light.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.425 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't care if the
moon makes nothing out of it.

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:44.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's like,
nothing grows there.

01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:46.780 align:middle line:84%
It would be embarrassing
for most suns to, like, ah,

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:48.160 align:middle line:90%
we don't talk about the moon.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.080 align:middle line:90%
Because here, it's so beautiful.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.280 align:middle line:90%
There's no expectation.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no return on investment.

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:55.240 align:middle line:84%
It's just the act of
being who we truly are.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.340 align:middle line:90%
And I was giving a seminar once.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said, we are
fundamentally love.

01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And someone said, do you
have any proof of that?

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:02.600 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, gosh, no.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So I went back and
I found the proof.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And I've written
articles about the proof.

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:08.020 align:middle line:90%
We are fundamentally love.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We thrive in a loving,
kind environment.

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:13.278 align:middle line:84%
We dissolve in
stressful situations.

01:18:13.278 --> 01:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
We can handle stress
and we can be violent.

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:19.630 align:middle line:84%
We can fight, but that's
not an enduring, sustainable

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:20.560 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.500 align:middle line:10%
We thrive, we evolve
when we give and care,

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.600 align:middle line:10%
and love and appreciate others.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:30.200 align:middle line:10%
When we give and be the
sun, amazing things happen.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.570 align:middle line:90%
So we want to tap into that.

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Because we are little mini
microcosms of the solar system.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.020 align:middle line:90%
That's who we are.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
We're a little suns
that want to shine.

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:38.360 align:middle line:90%
But our mind goes, no, no.

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:40.210 align:middle line:84%
Even if you shine, what
if they don't shine back,

01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:41.260 align:middle line:90%
and they don't love you back?

01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:42.050 align:middle line:90%
You'll be screwed.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.870 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, you better
hold onto your love and wait

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:45.130 align:middle line:90%
for them to love you.

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:46.480 align:middle line:90%
And they never do.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And you just find your ways to
somehow manipulate approval.

01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And it just seems to
be so short-sighted.

01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:57.770 align:middle line:90%
So much to share about so much.

01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's all right
here contained

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.950 align:middle line:84%

Where can people come to
learn more about what you do,

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:06.972 align:middle line:90%
and what you have to offer?

01:19:06.972 --> 01:19:08.430 align:middle line:10%
>>DOUILLARD: Yeah,
I have a website

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:11.040 align:middle line:10%

is up for free.

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Oh, excellent.

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:27.150 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Dr. John.

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:28.440 align:middle line:90%
I love you so much.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And it is so apparent
that you love what you do,

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and that you are a loving
presence on the planet.

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.003 align:middle line:84%
And anyone would be served
to be in touch with you.

01:19:36.003 --> 01:19:37.420 align:middle line:84%
So thank you again
for being here.

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DOUILLARD: Well,
thank you, Sue.

01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:38.992 align:middle line:90%
So good to see you again.

01:19:38.992 --> 01:19:40.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, wonderful.

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:42.930 align:middle line:10%
Ayurveda teaches us that
the most subtle elements

01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:45.815 align:middle line:10%
can lead to the most
profound levels of healing.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:47.190 align:middle line:10%
The first step on
that journey is

01:19:47.190 --> 01:19:51.150 align:middle line:10%
for us to follow the cycles
of nature, to eat seasonally.

01:19:51.150 --> 01:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
This first step is so
simple, but it opens the door

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.620 align:middle line:90%
to deeper psychological healing.
