Triple board certified

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.890 align:middle line:84%

>>BUSH: Mid 1970s saw the debut
of this chemical, glyphosate.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.920 align:middle line:10%
And it would become the
active ingredient initially

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:10%
in Roundup, which would
become a very popular weed

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:10%
killer in the 1980s, and
started to go beyond the farm

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:10%
with those direct consumer ads
showing that suburban homeowner

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.220 align:middle line:10%
walking out of his garage
with a dramatic soundtrack

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.653 align:middle line:10%
and a backpack on with
two pistol grip sprayers.

00:02:48.653 --> 00:02:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And he would shoot
down the four or five

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.390 align:middle line:90%
dandelions in his driveway.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And somehow that
direct to consumer

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
ad captured all of the
elements of the male brain.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Like you can be cool,
you can have guns,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.880 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to bend down
to weed, you can be out

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.480 align:middle line:84%
and doing your to
do list and not

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.820 align:middle line:84%
have to be distracted from
your pursuit of that warrior

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.140 align:middle line:90%
mentality, I believe.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And so something about that
really captured the attention.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And pretty soon, every
single big box store,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:84%
Home Depot down to
your garden stores,

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
were carrying multiple
variants of this Roundup kind

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.210 align:middle line:84%
of family of chemicals all based
on this glyphosate molecule.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And that molecule is very
similar to the Agent Orange

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
compound that became famous
during the Vietnam era.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this class is called
the organophosphates.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And Agent Orange, of
course, was the first time

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that I think warfare
at a large scale

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.670 align:middle line:84%
really turned our attention
to destroying Mother Earth.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we were
bombing huge areas

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:84%
of the jungles of
Vietnam and Cambodia

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.870 align:middle line:84%
to make bare the Ho Chi Minh
Trail and kill more Viet Cong.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And in this warfare
against nature,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:84%
we proved out the potency
of these chemicals

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:90%
to kill anything green.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
We turned those verdant jungles
into literal moonscapes.

>>SUE: Yes.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.550 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And then just a few
years after the war wraps up,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:84%
we repurpose that
family of molecules

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.150 align:middle line:84%
to become what is now today
the biggest and most popular

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:84%
class of weed killers
on the planet.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you
just share with us,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
what does it do that
is so dramatically

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.330 align:middle line:90%
harmful to the human system?

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yeah.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
In those initial patents in the
1970s coming out of Monsanto,

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
they actually bought
the chemical patent

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
from a Japanese
researcher who had found

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
or formed this man-made
chemical back in 1959.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And with those
initial patents, they

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
showed us the
mechanism of action,

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.190 align:middle line:84%
which is to disrupt an important
enzyme pathway in bacteria,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.770 align:middle line:90%
fungi, and plants.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was argued that it
must be safe for humans

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
because we don't have
that enzyme pathway that

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.690 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be the
primary mechanism of action

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:90%
of this chemical.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
What we then failed to
dig deeper on perhaps

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.760 align:middle line:84%
as regulatory agencies or
as farmers or consumers was,

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.910 align:middle line:84%
what does that enzyme pathway
do indirectly for humans?

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.220 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that enzyme pathway

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:84%
produces the
critical amino acids

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and contributes to the
medicinal quality of our food.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.960 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
essential amino acids

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:90%
because we can't make them.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And so we rely on
our food to deliver

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.250 align:middle line:84%
those via the bacteria, the
fungi in the plants themselves

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.747 align:middle line:84%
to get these building blocks
for proteins into our body.

00:05:36.747 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can imagine this a
little bit like the alphabet.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
You've got 26 letters, and you
can build hundreds of thousands

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:90%
of words from those.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, we build--
the 230,000 proteins

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
in the human body can be made
from these scant 20-some amino

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:90%
acids.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.430 align:middle line:84%
However, if you suddenly
block that food chain

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:84%
from producing those
building blocks,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:84%
you end up with missing vowels,
these critical essentials

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:84%
for spelling the
words correctly.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you delete
a couple vowels,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
you can imagine how
many words you misspell.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
our concerns, is

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
that as we delete out these
critical building blocks,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:84%
we start to even in
utero build bodies

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
that are misspelling
proteins, which

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
leads to misfolded proteins.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And that means the enzymes
that would be coming out

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.510 align:middle line:84%
of that protein structure
may be dysfunctional or not

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.050 align:middle line:84%
at their optimal rate
of capacity for repair

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:90%
or detoxification, whatnot.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But maybe more
insidiously, you end up

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.730 align:middle line:84%
really building the whole
scaffolding of the body

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:90%
with a weakened system.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.650 align:middle line:90%
Then you go beyond that now.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.960 align:middle line:84%
In the last decade has
been this explosion

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.000 align:middle line:90%
of data around the microbiome.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And this microbiome
catch term has really

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.450 align:middle line:84%
infiltrated everything from
peer review journals of any sort

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.430 align:middle line:84%
to your typical journal at
the side of your grocery store

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.810 align:middle line:90%
checkout line.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.482 align:middle line:84%
And this microbiome is poorly
understood by both consumers

00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:90%
and physicians at this point.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's supposed to describe
bacteria, fungi, parasites,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.870 align:middle line:84%
viruses in this
extraordinary ecosystem that

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.650 align:middle line:84%
is in a cooperative
relationship to build

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.950 align:middle line:90%
the foundation of life.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And that microbiome
is under attack

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.140 align:middle line:90%
from an antibiotic world.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And bizarrely, while glyphosate
and ultimately Roundup

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:84%
became known as weed killers,
it was never patented as such.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals were patented
instead as antibiotics.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we look back
over the last 40 years

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and realize we've been
pouring antibiotics

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.630 align:middle line:84%
into our soils and water
systems for the last 40 years

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.580 align:middle line:90%
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.890 align:middle line:84%
We doubled the amount
of Roundup sprayed

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
over global soils about
every six years since 1976.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.590 align:middle line:84%
The steepest climb in that was
really around 1996 to 2006.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
In that 10 years,
with the advent

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
of GMO Roundup Ready
crops, we no longer

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.490 align:middle line:90%
had to spot spray weeds.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And we could spray
the entire Midwest

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
with a single chemical
that would wipe out

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.560 align:middle line:84%
the microbiome of the
soils, which of course is

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.020 align:middle line:84%
what delivers the nutrients
and the medicines that

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
would become your food-based
medicinal complex.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And so now, over
the last 20 years,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.480 align:middle line:84%
we see the advent of
the chronic disease

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.470 align:middle line:90%
epidemics in our children.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
If you start at the As, you're
looking at autism, attention

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:90%
deficit, allergies, asthma.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.360 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
adult population,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing the explosion
of anxiety disorders

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
all the way to
Alzheimer's dementia.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.169 align:middle line:84%
And so all of those
diseases, seemingly

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.900 align:middle line:84%
in much disparate
organ systems, all

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
went vertical at
the same moment.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And that moment was '96 to 2006.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.997 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: A chain
reaction is happening.

00:08:42.997 --> 00:08:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And so here we are having
a conversation like this

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.210 align:middle line:84%
because people are
starting to realize,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.460 align:middle line:84%
hey, there's something really
massively happening here

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.690 align:middle line:90%
that we have to shift.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.800 align:middle line:84%
This is sterilizing our soil,
which is sterilizing our foods

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:90%
and sterilizing our guts.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:84%
And we're unable to function in
a healthful manner like this.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:90%
So what do you see happening?

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.380 align:middle line:90%
What do we do now?

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yeah.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that we change
our focus of attention.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to stop believing
that a Whole Foods or a Sprouts

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
grocery is going to
be our salvation.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
We have to stop believing that
the delivery system of food

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.670 align:middle line:84%
is going to have the
capacity to change the food

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.520 align:middle line:90%
system at large.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately, we
need a radical change

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.310 align:middle line:90%
in attention towards education.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And we need
education of children

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.270 align:middle line:84%
first because I
think at this point,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.700 align:middle line:84%
if we don't teach children
between kindergarten

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
and 12th grade right now
what the future needs

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
to look like in 10 years,
we won't get there,

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because there's too
slow a change in your 40

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.880 align:middle line:90%
to 50-year-old mindset.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got to change
that younger generation.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So we need a quick revolution
in education there.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.490 align:middle line:84%
We then need to match that
with a very rapid change

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.570 align:middle line:84%
in education and resources
for those farmers,

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.800 align:middle line:90%
those physicians.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.160 align:middle line:84%
How do you build a tool box
that's not chemically-based?

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And again, this world of more
natural health and integrative

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
medicine we find
over and over again

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that food is such a better idea
than pharmacy over and over.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, it's much better

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to breathe, walk
correctly, move correctly,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.130 align:middle line:84%
how to sleep correctly, how
to do these basics of life,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
and see what that
does to human biology

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
rather than wait
for the pipeline

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.720 align:middle line:84%
for some new hypertension drug
or new diabetes drug, which

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.910 align:middle line:84%
all of which have
these atrocious

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
lists of side effects
and adverse things,

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:90%
usually including death.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
change of attention

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
universally has to
come down to education.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
the best education

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.880 align:middle line:84%
is driven by the consumer
of that education,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.450 align:middle line:90%
the student itself.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.030 align:middle line:84%
And so regardless
of age right now,

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
I'd be very excited to see
humanity start to realize,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.390 align:middle line:84%
never have we had an
opportunity to be more curious

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.670 align:middle line:84%
and to be more excited
about our potential

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
because we literally have
to take down everything.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
We have to take down the
infrastructure of our farming

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.630 align:middle line:84%
industry, of our
medical industry,

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:14.150 align:middle line:84%
of our education system, of our
product and consumer behavior

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:90%
environments.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:84%
We need to change everything
in the next 10 to 15 years.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I'd love to just
back up just a little bit.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.555 align:middle line:84%
And describe this
human biome for people,

00:11:25.555 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:84%
just so that
everyone really gets

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.810 align:middle line:84%
clear on what that is
that we're working with

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and why it's so integral for our
ultimate health and well-being.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Our human
microbiome has now

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:84%
been understood to be
in a direct extension

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:90%
of our macro-ecosystem.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the microbiome described
as bacteria, fungi, parasites,

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
viruses, those are so abundant
on Earth that you literally

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.470 align:middle line:90%
cannot do anything.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.750 align:middle line:84%
You can't blink, you can't
breathe, you can't drink,

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.290 align:middle line:84%
you can't eat, you can't
sleep without the role

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:02.250 align:middle line:84%
of these microflora involved
your biology and your life.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd say that while we
don't know anything different

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:84%
about glyphosate in the last 10
years, we know a heck of a lot

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.080 align:middle line:84%
different about the microbiome
in the last 10 years.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And we need to now go
re-evaluate everything we

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:84%
believe about
medicine and pharmacy

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and look through that lens
of health doesn't happen.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you carry out--
multicellular life of a human

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.450 align:middle line:84%
or an earthworm doesn't happen
unless the microbiome is

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.820 align:middle line:90%
present and diverse.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
cool that we find out that

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.580 align:middle line:90%
in the end, what is health?

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:90%
It is diversity.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:90%
What is society?

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:90%
What is politics?

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.830 align:middle line:84%
What is healthy
versions of those?

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:38.125 align:middle line:90%
Diversity.

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:38.925 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Diversity.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And so I just get
very fascinated that we

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:84%
see these fractal truths
between the microscope

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and our geopolitical
environments,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.840 align:middle line:84%
that we need to
respect diversity,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.730 align:middle line:84%
we need to foster
diversity, we need

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.000 align:middle line:84%
to look for and understand the
roles of these diverse segments

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.110 align:middle line:84%
of humanity, the
microbiome, whatever it is.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that, we can start to do
something really magical, which

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.790 align:middle line:84%
is something called quorum
sensing when you're talking

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.412 align:middle line:90%
about bacteria or fungi.

00:13:04.412 --> 00:13:06.120 align:middle line:84%
What we've seen is
that a single bacteria

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.010 align:middle line:84%
seems to have no
intelligence about it.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But when millions or you grow
up into billions of bacteria

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.880 align:middle line:84%
start to function in
a greater ecosystem,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.070 align:middle line:84%
they have a higher
intelligence to them.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And that gets me very excited
that with 7 billion people

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:84%
on the planet right now,
given the opportunity

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:84%
to interact with one another
directly without being

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.350 align:middle line:84%
manipulated by belief
systems, political, religious,

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise, if we
had an opportunity

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.720 align:middle line:84%
to directly interact human
inquisitive nature, creativity,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.370 align:middle line:84%
and our capacity
for problem solving,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.700 align:middle line:84%
we would see a society
emerge that would-- has never

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:90%
been seen on the planet.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's my optimistic
thing because in the end,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.450 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
numbers right now,

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
our species dies in the
next 50 to 70 years.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.738 align:middle line:90%
We go extinct.

00:13:51.738 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's really no way
around those numbers anymore.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.200 align:middle line:84%
We used to think,
well, if we change it

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:90%
in 10 years, 15 years.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.100 align:middle line:84%
If we do anything in a
linear fashion between now

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and the next 20 or 30
years, we go extinct

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:90%
in the next few decades.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And so we need a seismic
event in consciousness.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:84%
We need a complete
transformation event

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.593 align:middle line:84%
on a species level,
an elevation event.

00:14:12.593 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And I believe
that's probably what

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
Gaia's message is
over and over again

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:17.732 align:middle line:84%
is, we could do
this differently.

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:18.940 align:middle line:90%
What could we do differently?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.398 align:middle line:84%
We could do everything
differently.

00:14:20.398 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:84%
We could do consciousness
differently.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And when we look through the
lens of a new consciousness

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.060 align:middle line:84%
of connectivity and based on
the understanding of diversity

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:84%
at every level, from your
fractal levels of the viruses,

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.970 align:middle line:84%
to the bacteria, to the
fungi, to the human,

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
and you start to see that
and then Mother Earth

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.380 align:middle line:84%
herself, and its
respiratory cycles,

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and reliance on the
microbiome for her lungs,

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.060 align:middle line:84%
the way in which she
breathes in the CO2,

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:84%
as we annihilate the
microbiome, we can't breathe.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:90%
And so we accumulate CO2.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And Mother Earth is having the
same symptoms as the humans,

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.860 align:middle line:84%
or the earthworms, or
the biome of the soil.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.082 align:middle line:90%
And we're collapsing.

00:14:57.082 --> 00:14:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And we look back at that,
and we're like, oh my gosh,

00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:01.440 align:middle line:90%
we just did one thing wrong.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.270 align:middle line:84%
We just kept thinking
we were one species,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:90%
and we could rule it all.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.225 align:middle line:90%
And we got a collapse then.

00:15:06.225 --> 00:15:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: How can you
share with people

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:84%
that they can reverse
our ability to detoxify?

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Toxins build up under
these circumstances.

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
With everything that
you're discussing,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.800 align:middle line:84%
we boil it right down to the
physiology of any individual

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.090 align:middle line:90%
that's watching right now.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:84%
What can they do
to begin internally

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and in their lifestyle
to shape shift

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
their ability to--
their contribution

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:90%
to turning this around?

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Maybe I'll
just drill down real

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
quick on that understanding
of, what is toxification?

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.000 align:middle line:90%
How does toxification hurt?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And that leads us to the quick
answer of, how do we detoxify?

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:43.620 align:middle line:84%
We become toxic when
we lose our boundaries.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:47.080 align:middle line:84%
The human body, as well as
any multicellular organism,

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:84%
is designed with very,
very good engineering

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:84%
to keep the outside world out
and keep the inside world in

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and then build an
immune system that

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.738 align:middle line:84%
would understand the
difference between outside

00:15:56.738 --> 00:15:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and inside, such
that if you ever

00:15:58.140 --> 00:15:59.915 align:middle line:84%
got a little bit
of the outside in,

00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:84%
you'd be able to attack it
immediately, destroy it.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.498 align:middle line:84%
And it would never
cause any threat

00:16:03.498 --> 00:16:05.670 align:middle line:90%
to the internal environment.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:84%
What I just described
is literally

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
self-identity at
the biologic level.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.590 align:middle line:84%
In humans, our
largest barrier of--

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.130 align:middle line:84%
that would become our
definition of self-identity ends

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:18.840 align:middle line:90%
up being our gut boundary.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.625 align:middle line:84%
The intestinal boundary
between the lumen of our gut

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:23.250 align:middle line:84%
where we put all of
our food and water,

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and our whole microbiome is
dominantly represented there

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:27.710 align:middle line:90%
in the--

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.460 align:middle line:84%
from your sinuses all the
way down to your colon.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.480 align:middle line:84%
This microbiome ecosystem
lives within this tube that

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.610 align:middle line:90%
is supposed to be the outside.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:37.350 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out that
our lab has really

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.320 align:middle line:84%
worked very hard to understand
the relationship of glyphosate

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.930 align:middle line:84%
again, this Roundup chemical,
and its relationship

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:43.890 align:middle line:90%
to that barrier.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:46.290 align:middle line:84%
And bizarrely, the
very first thing

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
that this chemical does
directly to the human

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
is destroy the Velcro that holds
that cell barrier together.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.960 align:middle line:90%
We call these tight junctions.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And they look a lot like Velcro
under an electron microscopy

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.280 align:middle line:90%
or under the protein structures.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.770 align:middle line:84%
They can tear apart like
Velcro, and then big stuff

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.590 align:middle line:90%
can pass through.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
And then they can zipper back
up and protect you again.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:84%
So they are designed to be
this intelligent gatekeeper

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
of material from
outside to inside.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:84%
Sitting right behind the
tight junctions is some 80%

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:84%
of your immune system's
antibody production mechanism

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:84%
where we would produce
antibodies to fight

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.540 align:middle line:90%
against the outside world.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And so glyphosate first
undermines the microbiome,

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.494 align:middle line:90%
not just of our soils.

00:17:24.494 --> 00:17:26.619 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it gets-- it's
a water-soluble chemical,

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
which means getting
into water systems,

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
but it's also getting into
the water of your kale,

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.750 align:middle line:84%
or your Brussels sprouts,
or your potatoes.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And so you eat any root
vegetable or cruciferous

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.050 align:middle line:84%
vegetable, or fruit
from the apple tree,

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.432 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be integrated
into the water of that fruit

00:17:40.432 --> 00:17:42.390 align:middle line:84%
or vegetable, and you're
going to take that in.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And now that chemical is going
to do the same microbiome

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:90%
damage in your gut.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So you're losing
diversity and workforce

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.650 align:middle line:84%
in the microbiome of the
intelligence of the gut.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.700 align:middle line:84%
So step one of glyphosate
Roundup, wipe out microbiome.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:84%
Step two, erode self-identity
by destroying the Velcro.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And now that intelligent barrier
system becomes a leaky sieve.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.687 align:middle line:84%
And now life becomes
a constant food fight.

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Every bite of food you
take, every drink you

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.280 align:middle line:84%
take, you're going to
have to deal with not only

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:90%
the bad stuff in there.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.240 align:middle line:84%
You're also going to have to
deal with the macronutrients

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.980 align:middle line:90%
in an unprocessed fashion.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:84%
You can no longer regulate
the intake of things

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.403 align:middle line:84%
like macronutrients,
like fiber for example.

00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Kale is loaded with all
these insoluble fiber, which

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.220 align:middle line:84%
is really good for microbiome
support and anticancer effects

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:90%
in the colon.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But if that gets
past that barrier

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.562 align:middle line:84%
and into your immune
system, the human body

00:18:29.562 --> 00:18:32.020 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a mechanism to
deal with insoluble fiber well.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:34.182 align:middle line:84%
So now your inflammatory
reaction kicks in.

00:18:34.182 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is what I
would see in my clinic

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:84%
that led me down this whole
investigative pathway,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.230 align:middle line:84%
is I was kale juicing my
patients into oblivion trying

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:84%
to get the anti-cancer,
anti-inflammatory properties

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
of that food, only to find
out I was inducing a higher

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.740 align:middle line:90%
level of inflammation.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.532 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the first question that

00:18:49.532 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:90%
was asked of, how can this be?

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.780 align:middle line:84%
How can health food become
toxic to the individual?

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And so this topic of
toxicity comes down to,

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.300 align:middle line:90%
do you have a barrier or not?

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you're eating
food that's laced with

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.590 align:middle line:84%
or drinking water laced
with this Roundup chemical,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.615 align:middle line:90%
you end up losing that barrier.

00:19:04.615 --> 00:19:05.740 align:middle line:90%
And now you become a sieve.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And now you're bringing
everything into the body.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, those tight
junctions Velcro systems

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.830 align:middle line:90%
are not located just in the gut.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
The blood-brain barrier,
the kidney tubules,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.440 align:middle line:84%
and the entire vascular
tree all tied together

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.940 align:middle line:90%
with same tight junctions.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And so now we've
proved in our lab

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that as soon as that
gut injury happens,

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
the blood brain barrier let
go, the kidney tubules let go.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And now you have a leaky
sieve at the front end.

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.920 align:middle line:84%
All the toxins come
in, can't keep them out

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:84%
of the neurologic
system, go in there.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.700 align:middle line:10%
So now you're going to
see a high propensity

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.460 align:middle line:10%
for neurologic conditions,
everything from childhood

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.100 align:middle line:10%
to adult. You're going to see
this neurodegenerative injury

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.810 align:middle line:10%
kind of pathway,
which we've seen

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:10%
unfold in the public health.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And then at the back
end of kidney tubules,

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.660 align:middle line:84%
you can no longer do your
detoxification natural

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.060 align:middle line:84%
to the kidney, which is your
primary detox organ system.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end,
how do you detox?

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:84%
You have to reverse
that pathway.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.373 align:middle line:84%
Right now, we have
become magnets for toxin

00:19:56.373 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:84%
because we can't keep them
out, and we can't get them out.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And so we're these
sponges for toxin.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.730 align:middle line:84%
And so it really
begins at getting back

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.938 align:middle line:90%
in touch with the microbiome.

00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:06.522 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
we've proved this out

00:20:06.522 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
is by extracting
the communication

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
network between bacteria
and fungi from ancient soils

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.275 align:middle line:84%
and putting that into
human biologic systems.

00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And for the last
six years, we've

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.900 align:middle line:84%
been doing water
extractions from that

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.720 align:middle line:84%
and putting that into our
patients and clients worldwide

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.650 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.158 align:middle line:84%
And that just extract from
that intelligent system

00:20:23.158 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
of the microbiome, when it
touches the tight junctions,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:90%
they all zipper back together.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that boundary of who
are you as a human being

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:90%
is maintained by the microbiome.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Your species only knows itself
in the context of the diversity

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.040 align:middle line:90%
of the microbiome.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:39.820 align:middle line:90%
I find that fascinating.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: There is a greater
intelligence happening here.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.680 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we don't
try to transcend it,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.305 align:middle line:84%
and we allow it to do
its thing, it works.

00:20:47.305 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: It works.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
Mother Earth has the
intelligence, interestingly,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:90%
to heal us.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:90%
We do not.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I think we need this
paradigm shifting belief where

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.180 align:middle line:90%
we suddenly surrender and say--

00:20:59.180 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Surrender.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: --we can't
figure it out.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.705 align:middle line:84%
We can't figure out our
political structures,

00:21:02.705 --> 00:21:05.590 align:middle line:84%
economic structures, education
structures, or our technology,

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.000 align:middle line:90%
drug, chemical structures.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.700 align:middle line:84%
We can't figure that
out fast enough.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.640 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to immediately
surrender and say,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:90%
humble yourself, human species.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Get outside.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Go sit in and among the
ferns and the pines.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Go into the high country.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.790 align:middle line:84%
Go out and sit on a beach and
stare out into Mother Ocean.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:90%
And learn a different lifestyle.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Learn a different technology.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Learn a different approach
to knowledge itself.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
Learn a new education
system from Mother Earth.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
How would she create all
of those systems for us?

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't start
making her the template

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.150 align:middle line:84%
for every single thing
we do, we're gone.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.830 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I couldn't agree more.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.020 align:middle line:90%
We have to learn to listen.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
We have to learn to
breathe with nature.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.942 align:middle line:84%
We have to reunite ourselves
with a greater system

00:21:48.942 --> 00:21:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that we are actually
a part of, but we've

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:90%
been behaving otherwise.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Currently, we have a
variety of new conditions

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that are showing up in
our health care arena.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.260 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the
neurological conditions

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
or diagnoses that you're seeing
that are-- that can really

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.498 align:middle line:84%
be related to what
we're experiencing,

00:22:06.498 --> 00:22:07.790 align:middle line:90%
what we're talking about today?

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:09.530 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yeah.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
As I start this list,
you as a listener,

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to suddenly
be like, oh my gosh,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.505 align:middle line:90%
this is not just my household.

00:22:15.505 --> 00:22:17.630 align:middle line:84%
It's my entire extended
family, and it's my office,

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's my church, and it's my
synagogue, and it's my mosque.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's like every single
people group on the--

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.160 align:middle line:90%
is going to hear this list.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:84%
If we start at childhood,
the first neurologic evidence

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.470 align:middle line:84%
of real disruption of the
autonomic nervous system

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.030 align:middle line:90%
is something we call colic.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And it started to really kind of
come in the scene in the 1970s

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.850 align:middle line:84%
as a pretty significant
awareness of it.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:90%
But it was the minority of kids.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Today, colic is estimated at
maybe two out of three kids

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:48.293 align:middle line:84%
have some version of colic where
they have bloating, discomfort,

00:22:48.293 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
inconsolable crying in
the middle of the night

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
or after feedings, bowel
changes, diarrhea, loose

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:middle line:90%
stools, all of this stuff.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So colic starts even
in the first couple

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:90%
of weeks or months of life.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on to the
attention capacity, and so

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.097 align:middle line:84%
attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.

00:23:04.097 --> 00:23:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe one in three,
one in four children

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.280 align:middle line:90%
with some mild variant thereof.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, 1 in 10 are
diagnosed in the United States

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.040 align:middle line:84%
with a severe version that
necessitates medication.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the medicine
we put them on is speed.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So we put them on some
sort of adrenaline drug--

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.520 align:middle line:90%
Adderall, Ritalin, or whatnot--

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.950 align:middle line:84%
which of course shuts down
their creative capacity

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.742 align:middle line:84%
and puts them into a
fight or flight states

00:23:23.742 --> 00:23:26.840 align:middle line:84%
so that they will focus
on a multiple choice test.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And so those are
the initial signs

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that are obvious in
the neurologic segment.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.220 align:middle line:84%
But by the time we're in
our late single digits,

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:84%
and even unfortunately a
lot of pediatric conferences

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.620 align:middle line:84%
are now focusing on the
important clinical use

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
of antidepressants in
children under the age of two.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.080 align:middle line:84%
I can't even believe
we say that sentence.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I can't even believe we would
focus a medical conference

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:84%
on the intelligent
and responsible usage

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.600 align:middle line:84%
of antidepressants
in two-year-olds.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it's being done in an
enormous amount of children.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.160 align:middle line:84%
So by age two, we're
seeing depression, anxiety.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What is the criteria
they even put them on?

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:00.510 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Right.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:01.343 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What is that?

00:24:01.343 --> 00:24:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Listlessness,
lack of attention,

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:84%
a sense of inability to
get excited and engage,

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:90%
that kind of just I can't find--

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Got it.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.600 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: --connection.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.445 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Got it.

00:24:13.445 --> 00:24:16.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: Would rather just sit
on my butt and watch my iPad.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
That's not just the iPad
that's doing that to us.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
It's literally our chemical
structure breaking down.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And we now know that the
bacteria are directly

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.350 align:middle line:84%
involved in the production
of neurotransmitters,

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:90%
which is amazing.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So the bacteria touch something
called enteroendocrine cells

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:90%
that line our gut.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Some 10% to 15% of
the billions of cells

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
that line our intestines
are these endocrine cells.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And these guys are the factories
for serotonin primarily,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.690 align:middle line:84%
but also dopamine and
other neurotransmitters.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And while we've only seen
that interaction recently,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.710 align:middle line:84%
we've now just in the
last three or four years

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.350 align:middle line:84%
realized that the brain
is sending down neurons

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:84%
into the gut that then
extend past the gut lining

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.430 align:middle line:84%
to wrap around the
enteroendocrine cells

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:02.150 align:middle line:84%
to receive all of that
neurotransmitter upload

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.440 align:middle line:84%
but also stick out past
the lining of the gut

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to listen directly
to the microbiome.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's super
weird new science,

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.490 align:middle line:84%
that the brain is
actually listening

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:12.890 align:middle line:84%
not to some human
input but directly

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:84%
to the behavior and the
output of the bacteria

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:90%
and the fungi in your gut.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is largely
what we think

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
is probably ground
zero of this phenomenon

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.810 align:middle line:84%
where bacteria can
determine your behavior.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we've shown that if we
take the bacteria from somebody

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.820 align:middle line:84%
with a fast metabolism,
skinny body type,

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:31.940 align:middle line:84%
and put that in an obese person,
we can change their metabolism.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, human or rat,
if we take the microbiome

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.950 align:middle line:84%
from an obese human, and we
put that into a skinny rat,

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.950 align:middle line:84%
they're going to be obese
in a month with a very

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.750 align:middle line:90%
controlled calorie input.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not the calories
that made that mouse obese.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.760 align:middle line:84%
It's actually the
microbiome itself.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.670 align:middle line:84%
An adjustment in the
neurotransmitter activity

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.830 align:middle line:84%
and then which then
influences the relationship

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.140 align:middle line:84%
with the autonomic nervous
system, which then controls

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
things like internal
metabolism, the behavior

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.470 align:middle line:90%
of the mitochondria.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Are they going to crank
through glucose and fatty acids

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.962 align:middle line:84%
into fuel for only
muscle and the brain,

00:26:02.962 --> 00:26:05.420 align:middle line:84%
or are they going to crank that
through into adipose tissue

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.010 align:middle line:84%
for the visceral
fat that will then

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
go on to cause
fatty liver, type 2

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.710 align:middle line:84%
diabetes,
cardiovascular disease?

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And the whole list
goes on and on.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And so the bacteria
are right there

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.230 align:middle line:84%
at the front of
this interaction.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And so the neurologic conditions
as we collapse the microbiome,

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.790 align:middle line:84%
colic, your early sleep
disorders in the children,

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.010 align:middle line:84%
onto this kind of
attention deficit,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.463 align:middle line:84%
anxiety, into the
depression stuff.

00:26:27.463 --> 00:26:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And then by the
late teens, we are

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.150 align:middle line:84%
seeing these severe insomnia
syndromes, and unfortunately,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.700 align:middle line:84%
very radically in college
now, the explosion

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
of chronic fatigue, chronic pain
syndromes, weird chronic pain

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.770 align:middle line:84%
symptoms that we
never saw back when

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:84%
I was going through training in
the 1990s, these regional pain

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.460 align:middle line:90%
syndromes.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Fibromyalgia was just starting
to come online in the mid 1990s

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:84%
as we were going into GMO
crop production, Roundup Ready

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.530 align:middle line:84%
crops, and starting
to really be exposed.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.760 align:middle line:84%
But then by 2006, we have very
weird chronic pain syndromes

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.790 align:middle line:84%
where people with light touch
or a breath on their tissue

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:01.280 align:middle line:84%
get signal to the brain that
somebody's really putting

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.800 align:middle line:90%
a rasp right across their skin.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.550 align:middle line:84%
It feels like their
skin is being torn off

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:07.130 align:middle line:84%
by just a light touch or
a breath on their skin.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So the brain has
become so unwired

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
in its ability to take
input in as we wipe out

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.110 align:middle line:84%
this microbiome, we lose
the neurotransmitter base.

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.260 align:middle line:84%
We lose the stability of our
autonomic nervous system,

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and we literally miswire.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.565 align:middle line:84%
And now, we can't
figure ourselves out.

00:27:22.565 --> 00:27:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: The connectivity,
the interconnectivity

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.220 align:middle line:84%
of all of this is so obvious
when we see it chained together

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.270 align:middle line:90%
this way.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how anyone could
not see the direct connection

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.970 align:middle line:90%
and where we need to begin.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.607 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned this, the
children on the spectrum.

00:27:37.607 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
clarify for the viewers

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.877 align:middle line:84%
that autism is part of this
as well, in your opinion?

00:27:43.877 --> 00:27:44.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Absolutely, it is.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:45.170 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.878 align:middle line:84%
So the attention
deficit is the beginning

00:27:46.878 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:90%
of sensory processing deficits.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.680 align:middle line:84%
The autism spectrum
is the continuation

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.070 align:middle line:90%
of that same event.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And so in the extreme
version of autism,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:00.080 align:middle line:84%
you have a child that can't
talk, can't make eye contact,

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.380 align:middle line:84%
is so emotionally labile,
gets easily overwhelmed,

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.560 align:middle line:84%
has to have emotional outbursts
just to express something,

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, as this pent
up energy gets in there,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.310 align:middle line:90%
can't express itself.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:84%
This intelligent entity, this
brilliant soul within there

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.320 align:middle line:84%
can't get itself out, can't--
not only can't sensory process

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.230 align:middle line:84%
inward, can't sensory process
outward to communicate.

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.450 align:middle line:84%
And so they become in
this isolated cave.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.297 align:middle line:90%
And that's when pain sets in.

00:28:26.297 --> 00:28:28.130 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of these kids
are in such suffering

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that they'll be hitting
their head on their crib

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.230 align:middle line:84%
or on the wall of the house
for four or six hours a day

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:84%
and come into clinic
with a big knot

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.860 align:middle line:84%
and actual callus
on their forehead

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.717 align:middle line:84%
from just month after month
hitting their head so that they

00:28:39.717 --> 00:28:41.300 align:middle line:84%
can have a little
bit of pain stimulus

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.460 align:middle line:84%
to help them create that fight
or flight instinct to become

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.350 align:middle line:84%
focused enough to
filter out what

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.350 align:middle line:84%
is the chaos of their
sensory overwhelm.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.173 align:middle line:84%
And so the autism spectrum
is really in the end

00:28:52.173 --> 00:28:53.340 align:middle line:90%
the canary in the coal mine.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what we should have
seen coming 20 years ago

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and have been so
slow to wake up to.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.080 align:middle line:84%
But the numbers became
so ridiculous in 2012

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.630 align:middle line:84%
to 2015 that we
can no longer deny

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.910 align:middle line:84%
that we had an epidemic
of this neurologic injury

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.360 align:middle line:84%
in our children and most
often under the age of two.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
really the granddaddy

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.135 align:middle line:84%
of all those
neurologic injuries.

00:29:13.135 --> 00:29:14.760 align:middle line:84%
But at the same rate
that two-year-olds

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
are getting hit
with this injury,

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:84%
we see this same linear increase
that hasn't gone logarithmic

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:90%
like autism has yet.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.200 align:middle line:84%
But in our adult population,
climb of Parkinson's

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.250 align:middle line:84%
in males and the same climb
in Alzheimer's in women.

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, there's
sex differences

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:31.410 align:middle line:90%
in those two conditions.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at Parkinson's
rates and Alzheimer's rates

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:84%
for those two sexes, they
overlap almost perfectly.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
explosive thing.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.620 align:middle line:84%
Then you can add into
that ALS, MS, and these--

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.580 align:middle line:84%
what I would consider
one of the most prevalent

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.470 align:middle line:84%
neurologic injuries,
which is celiac disease,

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.940 align:middle line:84%
an autoimmune
disease against some

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.800 align:middle line:90%
of the compounds within wheat.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.610 align:middle line:84%
All of that neurologic explosion
in the same two decades,

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.742 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible that
this was a coincidence.

00:29:55.742 --> 00:29:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible that they have
different pathophysiologies,

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.970 align:middle line:84%
which everybody
wants us to think.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It can't just be that we're
vaccinating differently,

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.490 align:middle line:84%
because our adults who
aren't being necessary

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
vaccinated much
differently at all

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.690 align:middle line:84%
are seeing the same rise
in neurologic injury.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we are always at risk for
trying to find that one smoking

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.250 align:middle line:90%
gun thing.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.750 align:middle line:84%
And so then I come on the scene
with this glyphosate measure

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and say, I found
the smoking gun,

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.860 align:middle line:84%
but it's-- so what's
the difference?

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.500 align:middle line:84%
The difference is
the injury that we

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.350 align:middle line:84%
get from glyphosate doesn't
have to do with direct injury

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:84%
to the DNA, because they
can argue themselves out

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:31.110 align:middle line:90%
of that all the time.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's too small
of an injury to do

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:34.110 align:middle line:84%
what we've just
described happening,

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.060 align:middle line:90%
the extinction of our species.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.640 align:middle line:84%
What we did instead is we
eliminated, with this chemical,

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the foundation for
biology to happen.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.500 align:middle line:84%
So the smoking gun wasn't
an injury to humans;

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.450 align:middle line:84%
it was an injury
to an ecosystem,

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
to a planet that we
call Mother Earth,

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.440 align:middle line:84%
to a planet that
floats in vacuum space

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.940 align:middle line:84%
without any input
from the outside.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We can't get new stuff on
the planet to help us here.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.800 align:middle line:90%
We have a closed system.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:59.025 align:middle line:84%
This planet has to have all of
its solutions on-- in-house.

00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What do we do
to restore our gut?

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:03.670 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about Restore.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: So yeah.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Our first advent into these
water-soluble molecules

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.500 align:middle line:84%
was in my clinics
in Scottsville.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.923 align:middle line:84%
And we started to study
these in biologic systems

00:31:13.923 --> 00:31:15.840 align:middle line:84%
starting with cancer
because my background was

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.040 align:middle line:90%
in chemotherapy development.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So I was used to
doing cancer research.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.790 align:middle line:84%
And so my first
mindset was, wonder

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.650 align:middle line:84%
what it does to cancer
cells, because we

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.967 align:middle line:84%
had found these molecules
in soil science.

00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And they looked a lot like the
chemotherapy I used to develop.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.598 align:middle line:84%
And so the aha moment
was, what if we

00:31:29.598 --> 00:31:31.890 align:middle line:84%
had missed the fact that
maybe not just the plants have

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.690 align:middle line:90%
medicine?

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.210 align:middle line:84%
What if the soil
had medicine in it?

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.668 align:middle line:84%
And when we later found out
that the bacteria and the fungi

00:31:36.668 --> 00:31:38.400 align:middle line:84%
were making those
medicinal compounds,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.900 align:middle line:84%
we got really
excited of like this

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.400 align:middle line:84%
might close the loop of these
correlations we've been making

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.122 align:middle line:84%
of collapse of the
diversity of microbiome

00:31:45.122 --> 00:31:47.580 align:middle line:84%
leading to disease in humans
in a very predictable fashion.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.500 align:middle line:84%
Lose these bacteria,
you get breast cancer.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.970 align:middle line:84%
Lose these bacteria,
you get colon cancer.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Lose these bacteria,
you get prostate cancer.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was so specific
by species really

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.500 align:middle line:84%
as to the vulnerabilities
we would create in our body.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And then you
suddenly realized,

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.640 align:middle line:84%
wait, each species makes its
own variant of these carbon

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.570 align:middle line:84%
molecules as specific
medicines to target organs,

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to target systems,
to keep us healthy.

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And as we destroy the
micro-ecosystem, we get this.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And so we went on to create
a dietary supplement line out

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:14.850 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly, we had
to give up the whole belief

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.710 align:middle line:84%
system of healthy
cells and cancer cells,

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:22.290 align:middle line:84%
because it was doing things we
had never seen before in Petri

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.390 align:middle line:90%
dishes, which was healing.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Nobody ever sees healing
happen under a Petri dish.

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So we can show all kinds of
different injuries and all

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:90%
that but--

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interesting.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: --to watch
three-dimensional structures

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.390 align:middle line:84%
come back together
in a Petri dish

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:35.820 align:middle line:84%
and start to build more
three-dimensional structure,

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that's not something
normal to see in biology.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.290 align:middle line:90%
So we had to go, wait.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.415 align:middle line:84%
We had to drop the whole
cancer thing and just say,

00:32:42.415 --> 00:32:44.040 align:middle line:90%
what's happening to human cells?

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.080 align:middle line:84%
What's happening to
health inherently

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.720 align:middle line:84%
when we touch it with this
ancient soil and these soil

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.680 align:middle line:90%
extracts?

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:84%
And the answer was
it repairs faster,

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:84%
so fast that it looks
like an instant fix.

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.600 align:middle line:84%
It looks like this
liquid went and fixed

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.267 align:middle line:84%
the gut lining, or
the vascular lining,

00:32:59.267 --> 00:33:01.350 align:middle line:84%
or the blood-brain barrier,
or the kidney tubules.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.110 align:middle line:90%
It's so quick.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.485 align:middle line:84%
It's within minutes,
everything's

00:33:03.485 --> 00:33:05.790 align:middle line:84%
back together in its
perfect form, which

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
is such a complex biologic
event that we just couldn't

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:10.450 align:middle line:90%
believe it was happening.

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And so thousands of times later
now, over the last seven years,

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.240 align:middle line:84%
you see it over, and
over, and over again.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.525 align:middle line:84%
And you come to realize the
liquid from Mother Earths' soil

00:33:18.525 --> 00:33:20.190 align:middle line:90%
is not fixing anything.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.680 align:middle line:84%
It's functioning as a wireless
network, a communication

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.210 align:middle line:84%
network of exchange
of information

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.168 align:middle line:90%
across a very complex system.

00:33:26.168 --> 00:33:27.960 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as a cell
has unfettered access

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.390 align:middle line:84%
to information, it
knows exactly how

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:33.550 align:middle line:84%
to respond to the environment to
fix that injury no matter what

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.350 align:middle line:90%
the injury.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:36.810 align:middle line:84%
So we can see this
same thing for gluten,

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:40.620 align:middle line:84%
for glyphosate, for alcohol, for
Miralax and these constipation

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.690 align:middle line:84%
drugs that do damage
to those same systems.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:84%
We can see the cells
respond in the same way.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end
it's not the nadirs

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:84%
of the injury or the liquid
supplement that's doing it.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.340 align:middle line:84%
It's the communication
between the systems.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And that gets really
cool to think about.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.260 align:middle line:84%
If cells can repair
anything, and we've shown it

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.333 align:middle line:84%
in all kinds of
myriad of conditions,

00:34:01.333 --> 00:34:03.250 align:middle line:84%
inflammatory conditions,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.635 align:middle line:84%
the cells know what to do
if they have information.

00:34:05.635 --> 00:34:06.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They know what to do.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.889 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Humans, I
believe, are the same.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.370 align:middle line:84%
If we had unfettered
access to information,

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:16.179 align:middle line:84%
we would know how to repair not
just ourselves but our species,

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.620 align:middle line:84%
our political structures,
our economic structures.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.409 align:middle line:90%
We have the knowledge within us.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:22.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the template
for that knowledge

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.880 align:middle line:90%
is in what we call the junk DNA.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.620 align:middle line:84%
You only have 20,000 genes,
and 98.5% of all those DNA base

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.235 align:middle line:84%
pairs that wrap around Mother
Earth don't code for a gene.

00:34:32.235 --> 00:34:33.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what we
call the junk DNA.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:37.630 align:middle line:84%
98 and 1/2% of all of your
DNA doesn't make a gene.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.889 align:middle line:90%
And so what does it do?

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.440 align:middle line:84%
In the end, we find
this deep wisdom

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.080 align:middle line:84%
of communication
response, injury response,

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and the exchange of information
at the genetic level

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.540 align:middle line:84%
between junk DNA to
the genes themselves.

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I get so intrigued
that, in the end, if we

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.295 align:middle line:84%
want to behave as we need to
in a higher consciousness,

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:59.170 align:middle line:84%
we need to figure out
what connectivity looks

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:90%
like that is unmanipulated.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Unfettered access to
correct information,

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.130 align:middle line:90%
we know how to respond.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:90%
We have to get rid of Google.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.810 align:middle line:84%
If your curiosity is immediately
manipulated into advertising

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.987 align:middle line:84%
dollars, you can never
follow that idea of curiosity

00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:15.570 align:middle line:84%
to its conclusion
because you're going

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
to be fed other people's
ideas and other people wanting

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:20.470 align:middle line:84%
to-- for you look
at their information

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.307 align:middle line:84%
rather than create your
own pathway of information.

00:35:23.307 --> 00:35:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't even be
curious today without it--

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.700 align:middle line:84%
we have to stop Facebook
and disassemble something

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:28.980 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.330 align:middle line:84%
Because human to human
social interactions

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.100 align:middle line:90%
can no longer be manipulated.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.470 align:middle line:84%
We need unfettered
access to information

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.020 align:middle line:84%
so that we can
respond correctly.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.200 align:middle line:84%
We now look at the
ecosystem of education.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And you look at how
much manipulation

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.280 align:middle line:84%
goes into the curriculum
of something as simple

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.237 align:middle line:90%
as the food pyramid.

00:35:47.237 --> 00:35:49.570 align:middle line:84%
What's now been turned into
different shapes of the food

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.790 align:middle line:84%
pyramid and all this
is being manipulated

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:56.110 align:middle line:84%
by primarily the sugar
lobby and the lobby

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.530 align:middle line:84%
systems of all these big
genetically modified processed

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.150 align:middle line:90%
food systems and all of this.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And so there's this constant
creep of perturbation.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.550 align:middle line:84%
From our curiosity all the
way to our education systems,

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:84%
there's manipulation happening
by advertising dollars,

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:90%
by big money systems.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:14.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we're going to
have to mimic nature.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:16.960 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
create a fungal communication

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.510 align:middle line:84%
network that passes the
information, nutrients,

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and health from cell to
cell as quickly as possible.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.945 align:middle line:84%
And so we need to think
that way as we think about,

00:36:24.945 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:84%
what does the future of IT
look like on the planet?

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:84%
What does the future of banking
look like on the planet?

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.158 align:middle line:84%
All these systems,
if we mimic fungi,

00:36:32.158 --> 00:36:33.325 align:middle line:90%
we're going to win the game.

00:36:33.325 --> 00:36:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We just need to come
home to ourselves again.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.608 align:middle line:90%
Just come back here.

00:36:37.608 --> 00:36:39.400 align:middle line:84%
We can really make a
difference by bringing

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.275 align:middle line:84%
all of our resources
and listening to nature,

00:36:41.275 --> 00:36:44.845 align:middle line:84%
reconnecting with the greater
being that we truly are.

00:36:44.845 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: I think that's right.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I think the one caution
there that I would add,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.210 align:middle line:84%
though, is that there's
this tendency to argue,

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:54.670 align:middle line:84%
we just need to go back to
the way we were in the 1960s.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We need to go back to the
way we were in the 1980s.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.520 align:middle line:84%
We need to go back to the
way the paleo man lived.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.820 align:middle line:90%
And the answer's no.

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Paleo man was killing all
of the large life around it

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.680 align:middle line:84%
and living as an egocentric
and selfish being as well.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.070 align:middle line:84%
And so for 200,000 years, we've
been doing the wrong thing

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:84%
in this concept of
connectivity and nature.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.732 align:middle line:84%
And I refer to
that as a species.

00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:16.690 align:middle line:84%
I know there's been
individuals that have maybe

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.240 align:middle line:90%
transcended that group think.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.757 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, we need
to become something we've

00:37:21.757 --> 00:37:22.840 align:middle line:90%
never been before perhaps.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:90%
I totally agree.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.250 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: And so
that's kind of the--

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.703 align:middle line:84%
in some ways, my
curiosity and excitement.

00:37:29.703 --> 00:37:31.120 align:middle line:84%
It'd be one thing
if people said I

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.078 align:middle line:84%
had to go back to the
way my grandparents were.

00:37:33.078 --> 00:37:35.328 align:middle line:84%
OK, but my grandparents
had to go to World War II

00:37:35.328 --> 00:37:36.370 align:middle line:90%
and slaughter each other.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.145 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:37:37.145 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: We need to tap
the evolution that

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.070 align:middle line:90%
is happening here.

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BUSH: We need to tap into
something bigger and become

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:41.020 align:middle line:90%
something--

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.937 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And come back
home to who we are today.

00:37:42.937 --> 00:37:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And all of this has
served-- everything

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.870 align:middle line:84%
that we've come to
the brink of has

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:49.140 align:middle line:84%
had to make a contribution
to our own evolution.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.210 align:middle line:84%
But we need to do the math,
and come back home, and take

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.005 align:middle line:90%
a new inventory before we--

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:54.880 align:middle line:90%
before it's too late.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.838 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Very well-said.

00:37:55.838 --> 00:37:58.440 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: So I love that
you have on your website

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.180 align:middle line:10%
a spirituality portal.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.617 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak about this?

00:38:02.617 --> 00:38:04.700 align:middle line:84%
I know that you are speaking
about this, actually.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:90%
It's what we're talking about.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Just speak a little bit to the
spiritual component of this.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.630 align:middle line:84%
We've spoken about the mental
and emotional components

00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.520 align:middle line:84%
and the physical health
and well-being that's

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.620 align:middle line:90%
obviously under threat here.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:20.920 align:middle line:84%
Just speak into specifically
spiritual application

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.470 align:middle line:84%
of what you're talking about,
just to lay it out for people.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.270 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Yeah.

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:84%
So our concept of
spirituality has

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:33.550 align:middle line:84%
been pretty much monopolized
by the religious infrastructure

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and belief systems on the planet
for the last couple of thousand

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:38.170 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.838 align:middle line:84%
We think of something like
Christianity, 2000 years old,

00:38:41.838 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:84%
maybe a little less than that
because really we hadn't really

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.050 align:middle line:84%
put that into a religious
structure for another 100,

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:53.140 align:middle line:84%
150 years after that
turn of our calendar.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.730 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of the Muslim
system and everything else,

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:57.720 align:middle line:90%
maybe 600 years old.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.160 align:middle line:84%
So these are recent
events in a species that's

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.020 align:middle line:90%
been around 200,000 years.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:07.357 align:middle line:84%
And so certainly, if we look
at aboriginal peoples and cave

00:39:07.357 --> 00:39:08.940 align:middle line:84%
dwellings and
everything else, they're

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.200 align:middle line:84%
already expressing
spirituality before we

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:17.233 align:middle line:84%
had the iconology or the lexicon
of religious belief systems

00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:18.400 align:middle line:90%
and all of their mechanisms.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.780 align:middle line:90%
And so what was that?

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.950 align:middle line:90%
What was that expressing?

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And so that's one
side of the spectrum.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The other side of
the spectrum you

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:25.598 align:middle line:84%
can discover in the
weirdest place, which

00:39:25.598 --> 00:39:30.130 align:middle line:84%
is the extreme technology-ridden
and inhumane environment

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:90%
of an ICU.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I find my way
back to spirituality myself.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
I was at the
University of Virginia

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.640 align:middle line:84%
at this point in my career and
was spending ridiculous hours,

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
80 to 100 hours a
week in residency.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And every month that you had
an ICU rotation, you're on--

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.060 align:middle line:84%
every three nights, you're
on for a 36-hour shift.

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:54.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're just steeped
in humanity, and humanity

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.900 align:middle line:84%
at this tipping point
between life and death.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes
very interesting.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.970 align:middle line:84%
You see the veil thin,
very, very quickly

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:03.910 align:middle line:84%
between what we believe
and what's actually

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.490 align:middle line:84%
happening in those
minutes, hours, and days

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.590 align:middle line:90%
around what we call death.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And so in those years,
I really started

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.750 align:middle line:84%
to have to deconstruct my
own religious belief system.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Raised in a pretty
open-minded church in Boulder,

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
a couple of hippie
parents, and really

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:24.130 align:middle line:84%
grounded into what our church
really saw as the Book of Acts

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.410 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
Greek and the Hebrew.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.473 align:middle line:84%
And if it was
going to be done, I

00:40:28.473 --> 00:40:29.890 align:middle line:84%
feel like I was
in the church that

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.265 align:middle line:84%
was going to teach
me not beliefs

00:40:31.265 --> 00:40:33.790 align:middle line:90%
but real wisdom in there.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.710 align:middle line:84%
But what I was seeing
in the ICUs really

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.630 align:middle line:84%
started to challenge
even what I thought

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.870 align:middle line:84%
was a pretty holistic
approach to spirituality.

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And it really fell
apart when I started

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.060 align:middle line:84%
to have the experience
of resuscitating patients

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.160 align:middle line:84%
whose heart stopped
and neurologic system

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.140 align:middle line:90%
comes to a standstill.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.272 align:middle line:84%
And you're resuscitating
him for 16, 20 minutes.

00:40:51.272 --> 00:40:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, their heart
starts beating again,

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:54.400 align:middle line:90%
and they come back.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And then when they really
regain consciousness

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.420 align:middle line:84%
over the next few hours,
they start telling you

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.045 align:middle line:84%
stories of what they experienced
on the other side of that veil

00:41:01.045 --> 00:41:02.478 align:middle line:90%
that we thought was an endpoint.

00:41:02.478 --> 00:41:04.270 align:middle line:84%
I certainly was taught
that as a physician.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.680 align:middle line:90%
That's your endpoint.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.820 align:middle line:90%
And yet, it's a birth.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:10.420 align:middle line:84%
It is a complete rebirth of
consciousness, awareness.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.680 align:middle line:90%
Who are you really?

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.120 align:middle line:90%
What were you here do you?

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Why did you come?

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.315 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
you are accepted,

00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and you were enough
the whole time.

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.980 align:middle line:84%
There was no sense of
failure in the whole story.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the stories they
would come back with--

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.550 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't matter what
their background was,

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:29.040 align:middle line:84%
an HIV patient dying of
complications of AIDS,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.020 align:middle line:84%
totally estranged
from his family,

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:33.520 align:middle line:84%
having the same experiences as
this African-American Baptist

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.618 align:middle line:84%
pastor surrounded by
250 of his congregation

00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:36.910 align:middle line:90%
the whole week that he's dying.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And they go back and
have the same experience

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:39.940 align:middle line:90%
on the same night.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'd just have to
say, I don't understand.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:44.470 align:middle line:90%
They're both the same.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:46.070 align:middle line:84%
They both had the
same experience.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.810 align:middle line:84%
The second life stops
in the biologic realm,

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.528 align:middle line:84%
life begins in the
singularity realm.

00:41:52.528 --> 00:41:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And so they'd come back and
those stories over and over

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.600 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And then they'd come
back with weirder stories

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.480 align:middle line:84%
of other planets and
traveling and all this stuff.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.813 align:middle line:84%
And you're just like, I don't
have a construct for that.

00:42:01.813 --> 00:42:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Nobody from my
religious experience

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.590 align:middle line:84%
to my scientific
explorations had given me

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:07.780 align:middle line:90%
a contract to understand that.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And so in the end,
I get very, very

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.590 align:middle line:84%
interested to find
out that we were told

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:15.940 align:middle line:90%
the wrong thing about science.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:20.500 align:middle line:84%
We were taught that bacteria
and the biology of the soil

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.470 align:middle line:90%
and humans was the story.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.570 align:middle line:84%
In the end, we're
hardly cellular.

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:84%
We are ultimately
atomic physics.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:90%
And so we aren't biologic.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.258 align:middle line:90%
We're biophysics.

00:42:31.258 --> 00:42:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And physics is
fascinating because it

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.510 align:middle line:84%
defines over and over again that
the universe is 99.999% vacuum

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:40.648 align:middle line:90%
space and 0.001% solid.

00:42:40.648 --> 00:42:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And so all of this
complex stuff I've

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.690 align:middle line:84%
been telling you about for the
last hour is all in the point

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.120 align:middle line:90%
0.001% range.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the reason why this is
such an important closing point

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:53.020 align:middle line:84%
is that if we keep focusing
our attention on the 0.01

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.060 align:middle line:84%
and try to find a
fulcrum in there

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.180 align:middle line:84%
to change the consciousness
that exists in the resonance,

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.160 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic
field resonance with that

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:03.073 align:middle line:84%
isn't within the
99.99% of the universe,

00:43:03.073 --> 00:43:04.990 align:middle line:84%
we're never going to
find a fulcrum big enough

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:07.220 align:middle line:84%
to rise consciousness
fast enough.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.178 align:middle line:10%
So we have to start to come to
the conclusion and the reality

00:43:11.178 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:10%
that whatever we see
happening biologically

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:18.040 align:middle line:10%
is simply just the
projection from the physics

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.610 align:middle line:10%
onto this slight
bit of solid matter

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.170 align:middle line:10%
that would become the biology.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And our biology could be
changed in a split instant

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.370 align:middle line:84%
if we make a
different observation.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: If we access
the rest of who we are.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:31.690 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:33.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:35.590 align:middle line:84%
How can people
learn more from you?

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:38.626 align:middle line:10%
>>BUSH: My education
website is zachbushmd.com.

00:43:38.626 --> 00:43:41.020 align:middle line:10%
And as mentioned,
there's lots of portals

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.190 align:middle line:10%
there into at
least a few minutes

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:46.880 align:middle line:10%
of my thoughts on everything
from pregnancy and fertility

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.010 align:middle line:10%
all the way to spirituality
there, everything in between.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.900 align:middle line:84%
And so that's my
access point for you.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.520 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole team to interact
with you in the social media

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:56.870 align:middle line:90%
environment.

00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:00.590 align:middle line:84%
We are really working hard
to reinvent the future of IT

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.460 align:middle line:90%
communications.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And we have a lot of work in
the energy sector and education

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:04.900 align:middle line:90%
sectors.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.858 align:middle line:84%
We have the non-profit
Farmer's Footprint.

00:44:06.858 --> 00:44:08.900 align:middle line:84%
So zachbushmd, you can
find just about everything

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:09.920 align:middle line:90%
I touch right now.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.080 align:middle line:90%
But farmersfootprint.us.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:15.500 align:middle line:84%
will take you to the free
viewing of the documentary

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:18.080 align:middle line:90%
that you saw a clip of tonight.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.910 align:middle line:90%
And go explore.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.010 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I think it's
important to say

00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that all of this information
that you've been sharing

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.190 align:middle line:84%
is not to terrify
us, to scare us,

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.080 align:middle line:90%
but really just to wake us up.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.390 align:middle line:90%
It's like shock value.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:33.410 align:middle line:90%
It has that impact.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:34.970 align:middle line:90%
It's like, wait a second.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's very clear that you
have a very large view of what

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.070 align:middle line:84%
a great unifying
spiritual truth is

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:46.435 align:middle line:84%
and how we need to
return to that awareness

00:44:46.435 --> 00:44:48.560 align:middle line:84%
if we ever want to make a
difference on the biology

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:84%
that we are being
as a quantum self

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:54.110 align:middle line:84%
arriving here on
planet Earth and living

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.640 align:middle line:90%
our lives in harmony.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.970 align:middle line:90%
So thank you so much.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:44:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: Wonderful.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And with a closing thought
of with great intention

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.260 align:middle line:90%
and purpose.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.510 align:middle line:84%
We come in these
quantum states of souls

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:07.340 align:middle line:84%
with a great sense
of deep purpose,

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.240 align:middle line:90%
a great sense of intention.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And I think that the--

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.510 align:middle line:84%
ultimately, the cellular stress
that then elicits disease

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.430 align:middle line:84%
is a demonstration
of the friction

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:21.150 align:middle line:84%
between our energetic purpose
and the life we're living out.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And so if you have
disease in your life,

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:25.610 align:middle line:84%
start to think more
holistically about that.

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you don't have
hypertension and cancer

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.870 align:middle line:84%
or whatever that you've
been told you have.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you simply have
an enormous amount

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of friction between where you
should be as a soul purpose

00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:36.680 align:middle line:84%
and where you are right
now because you're

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.900 align:middle line:84%
following a belief
system that is not true.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And so surrender everything,
and surrender to the possibility

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.890 align:middle line:90%
that you are on purpose.

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you could accelerate
into that river of flow,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.672 align:middle line:84%
that is your quantum self
and that biophysics state,

00:45:50.672 --> 00:45:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I think you will
transcend whatever

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:54.675 align:middle line:84%
biologic healing process
you think you need ahead.

00:45:54.675 --> 00:45:56.203 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautifully put.

00:45:56.203 --> 00:45:57.620 align:middle line:84%
Let us learn through
the friction.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.445 align:middle line:84%
Let it be for us
instead of against us.

00:45:59.445 --> 00:46:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>BUSH: That's right.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.950 align:middle line:84%
We now know that the way
to restore global health

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:07.010 align:middle line:84%
is by restoring our most
ancient source of nutrients,

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.740 align:middle line:84%
our food, our water,
and the very soil

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.540 align:middle line:90%
that is meant to sustain us.

00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:14.150 align:middle line:84%
We can no longer see ourselves
separate from the land

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:18.340 align:middle line:84%
or legitimized to manipulate
Mother Nature for a profit.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:22.370 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen, we have
and will pay dearly.

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.880 align:middle line:84%
