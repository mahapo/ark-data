How would you resonate

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.205 align:middle line:84%
with the magazine titled
What Doctors Don't Tell You,

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:39.506 align:middle line:90%
well, it's here.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.842 align:middle line:84%
Lynne McTaggart decided to
put her journalistic skills

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.310 align:middle line:90%
to practical use and starting

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.779 align:middle line:84%
up this international
magazine devoted

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.080 align:middle line:90%
to giving people information

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.983 align:middle line:84%
that is untainted
by big farmer money.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.953 align:middle line:84%
The end result is a
beautiful, diverse, informative

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:56.356 align:middle line:84%
and highly useful magazine but
not without controversy directed

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:59.392 align:middle line:84%
at it from the medical
community, big surprise there.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.227 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back Lynne.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.328 align:middle line:90%
>> Lynne McTaggart: Thank you.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:02.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith:
It's been a little while

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.096 align:middle line:84%
since we've sat together
about a year.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:04.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Lynne McTaggart: Yeah.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.599 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: This
is a beautiful magazine

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.334 align:middle line:84%
and its really-- what I think
what you've done is really,

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:10.971 align:middle line:84%
you-- it's a service, you've
created and correlated a lot

00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:14.107 align:middle line:84%
of different articles and have
a lot of different features

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.244 align:middle line:84%
that are useful in our everyday
lives from most people and some

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.313 align:middle line:84%
of it is controversial and
that's where I want to go.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.883 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] Whereas why-- I
guess it's a no brainer

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:25.752 align:middle line:84%
but what inspired you to
start this new magazine?

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Lynne McTaggart: A
grand passion, Regina,

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.589 align:middle line:84%
which was my own
passion to get better.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:33.125 align:middle line:84%
I mean I started the
way a lot of people do

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.095 align:middle line:90%
when they investigate something.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.363 align:middle line:84%
I needed to find
out why I was ill

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.167 align:middle line:90%
and this was in the mid '80s.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:44.371 align:middle line:84%
And after awhile I went from
very conventional doctors

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.240 align:middle line:84%
to the very outer
rim of alternatives.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.875 align:middle line:84%
And when no one could figurer
out what was wrong with me,

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:52.244 align:middle line:84%
I decided, well, if I'm going
to get better I'm going to have

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.581 align:middle line:90%
to research the-- myself.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So, I researched
what I thought I had

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.352 align:middle line:84%
and I then found a
specialist doctor

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:01.021 align:middle line:90%
who was a really a pioneer

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
in nutritional medicine
to get me better.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.961 align:middle line:84%
And together we were a
partnership in working on these.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.965 align:middle line:84%
And the experience was so heady
and amazing in transformative

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:15.335 align:middle line:84%
for me, I just got kind
of boring on this subject.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.271 align:middle line:84%
I started telling everybody
about it proselytizing about--

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.072 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: So they run.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.006 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: -- function medicine.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.007 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Would you
like a cup of tea?

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.509 align:middle line:90%
No, I have other things going.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.844 align:middle line:90%
Don't want to hear about it.

00:02:23.844 --> 00:02:24.377 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.745 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:26.846 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. And so, my husband
after awhile just said, "Well,

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.682 align:middle line:90%
don't tell me, tell the world."

00:02:28.682 --> 00:02:30.884 align:middle line:84%
So, we started a
news letter back

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:34.688 align:middle line:84%
in 1989 called What Doctors
Don't Tell You which was full

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:36.189 align:middle line:90%
of all this controversial stuff

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.492 align:middle line:84%
but then we felt the time was
right last year to launch this

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:42.862 align:middle line:84%
as a magazine, a
general feature magazine

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.898 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we've been
doing-- doing ever since.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.299 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Beautiful work.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.637 align:middle line:84%
OK. So, you're a-- you have a
panel of doctors as your experts

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.806 align:middle line:84%
which is good, that was
a very smart thing to do

00:02:52.806 --> 00:02:55.175 align:middle line:84%
but tell us a little bit
about the various people

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:90%
that you enlisted

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.812 align:middle line:84%
on an editorial level
for the magazine.

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:02.382 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, each of them are
specialists in particular areas

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:06.686 align:middle line:84%
but they're all-- they all share
one thing which is an open mind.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.854 align:middle line:90%
You're open-minded.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:11.524 align:middle line:84%
They're pioneers in
different areas often

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.126 align:middle line:90%
nutritional medicine.

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:17.397 align:middle line:84%
We've got one fellow who is
a natural path acupuncturist,

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:20.967 align:middle line:84%
osteopath and herbalist,
an herbalist.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:22.869 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's a mix of
all of those things

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.571 align:middle line:90%
so he's quite special.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.272 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Amazing.

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:26.306 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: And which is--

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.407 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: When we look
through the pages.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:27.908 align:middle line:84%
>> LM:Dr. Harald Gaier
[assumed spelling].

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:28.742 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:29.676 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: I mean he is remarkable.

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:31.011 align:middle line:84%
He's just a remarkable
researcher

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.846 align:middle line:90%
as well as practitioner.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:36.915 align:middle line:84%
And we just try to find people
like that who were specialists

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:40.552 align:middle line:84%
in new ideas about food,
new ideas about supplements.

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:45.525 align:middle line:84%
We have one guy who specializes
in treating no hopers.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.862 align:middle line:84%
People with cancer, people
with multiple sclerosis

00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:52.465 align:middle line:84%
and he's got thousands
of people better

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.900 align:middle line:90%
with a very different approach.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.302 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:57.903 align:middle line:84%
And there are-- I've interviewed
a couple people like that here

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.273 align:middle line:84%
in America as well, Dr, James
Forsythe [assumed spelling]

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:03.043 align:middle line:84%
and it's like all
of them have to go

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:05.812 align:middle line:84%
through the same kind
of trial however.

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Absolutely.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.548 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: In terms of--
it's difficult.

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:10.517 align:middle line:84%
And so, let me just
ask you upfront.

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.186 align:middle line:84%
When you launched the magazine,
because now it's glossier,

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:14.721 align:middle line:84%
it's bigger, you
have a bigger reach,

00:04:14.721 --> 00:04:18.290 align:middle line:84%
it's not just a newsletter,
what happened with the medical

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.794 align:middle line:84%
and pharmaceutical
industry's response?

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:22.929 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, we had
an organization

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:29.602 align:middle line:84%
that is it is backed, it's
sponsored by certain elements

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:33.306 align:middle line:84%
of the pharmaceutical
industry and other areas,

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:38.511 align:middle line:84%
that claims to have to be
sensible about science,

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:90%
and they attempted to ban us.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.351 align:middle line:84%
They wrote to our distributors,
they wrote to the news agents

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.954 align:middle line:84%
who carry us, they
wrote to supermarkets.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:52.025 align:middle line:84%
They try to cover everybody to
say this magazine is dangerous

00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:54.160 align:middle line:84%
and it should be
taken off the shelves.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.428 align:middle line:90%
Well, it backfired.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:58.231 align:middle line:84%
The magazine became much
more popular as a result.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.466 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I love that.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.101 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And we had thousands
of supporters writing

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.303 align:middle line:84%
in to the same people,
the supermarkets,

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:05.538 align:middle line:84%
the news agents et
cetera saying,

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.474 align:middle line:84%
"We really like what
they're doing.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.376 align:middle line:90%
We want this magazine."

00:05:09.376 --> 00:05:12.846 align:middle line:84%
So, and the distributors
themselves found that they're--

00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:14.481 align:middle line:84%
they were taking
the magazine home.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.182 align:middle line:90%
They were avidly reading it.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:19.853 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's made
absolutely no difference.

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:23.356 align:middle line:84%
But we've also had, you know,
the medical profession tried

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:26.359 align:middle line:84%
to catch us out with
material but all

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.928 align:middle line:84%
of this stuff is
very well researched.

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.063 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:05:30.063 --> 00:05:31.064 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I mean, we read
the medical literature.

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:32.465 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:36.202 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I'm often times on camera
with doctors and I'm probably,

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:37.837 align:middle line:84%
you know, I probably
know more about what's

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.506 align:middle line:84%
in the medical literature
than they do.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.340 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.307 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Just the from the fact

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:42.475 align:middle line:84%
that we're studying
it all the time.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:44.511 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: But it doesn't stop.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:48.581 align:middle line:84%
Well, skeptic-- it's called
skeptical that I think UK

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.649 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.684 align:middle line:84%
I was looking at some
of their comments,

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.354 align:middle line:84%
pseudoscience pa
[phonetic] and all of that.

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:58.257 align:middle line:84%
You-- it stirred up a lot of
controversy because if you go

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:01.027 align:middle line:84%
in the page you'll find your
site and then you'll find all

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:03.029 align:middle line:84%
of these just terrific
comments all

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.298 align:middle line:84%
from the medical
industry, all from doctors.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Absolutely, and
of course, they go into.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.068 align:middle line:84%
I mean we have an
inflammatory title.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:10.036 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: What Doctors
Don't Tell You.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.838 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Don't tell you [laughs].

00:06:11.838 --> 00:06:12.972 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: We're not
playing our punches.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
We feel this information
has to get out there.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.211 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, you're
right about that.

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:20.513 align:middle line:84%
What about what's
happening in the UK?

00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:23.149 align:middle line:84%
Because you're an American who's
married to a Brit who is living

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.453 align:middle line:84%
in UK and have been for a long
time, that's your culture now.

00:06:26.453 --> 00:06:30.290 align:middle line:84%
What is happening there
regarding some of the laws

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.627 align:middle line:84%
and also in the EU, UK
and EU because I read all

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:84%
of these emails and such it
come through where herbalist,

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:41.835 align:middle line:90%
homeopaths, all different types

00:06:41.835 --> 00:06:44.604 align:middle line:84%
of alternative practitioners
are constantly

00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:46.206 align:middle line:90%
under some kind of threat?

00:06:46.206 --> 00:06:48.107 align:middle line:90%
Can you tell us what's going on?

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:49.209 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.178 align:middle line:84%
Several years ago, in
the European Union,

00:06:52.178 --> 00:06:57.851 align:middle line:84%
the EU there was a decision
made to harmonize the business

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:00.720 align:middle line:84%
of vitamins and alternative
medicine

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.223 align:middle line:84%
and alternative medicine
products.

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:07.794 align:middle line:84%
And the idea was to have an
economic level of playing field

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:10.063 align:middle line:84%
so that all of the
countries would be able to buy

00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:13.399 align:middle line:84%
in each other's products 'cause
otherwise there was a nightmare

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.435 align:middle line:84%
of different loss
about, you know,

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:90%
levels of supplements et cetera.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.672 align:middle line:90%
That was the ostensible reason.

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:84%
The actual reason was a highly
political situation funded

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.381 align:middle line:84%
by the pharmaceutical industry
to try to takeover control

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and finally squash the
independent vitamin

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.688 align:middle line:90%
business basically.

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:39.659 align:middle line:84%
So, they put forward a bunch
of laws that would restrict,

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:41.628 align:middle line:90%
severely restrict the kind

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:44.964 align:middle line:84%
of supplements we
could buy as public.

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:48.368 align:middle line:84%
And they would be only certain
kinds that we're licensed

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:53.973 align:middle line:84%
and the licensed after testing
which requires, you know,

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.910 align:middle line:84%
companies like Big Pharma,
we have deep pockets

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.012 align:middle line:90%
in order to do this testing.

00:07:59.012 --> 00:08:02.315 align:middle line:84%
And as well, it would favor
the kind of synthetic kind

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.218 align:middle line:84%
of vitamins that
are mass produced.

00:08:05.218 --> 00:08:07.820 align:middle line:84%
They also wanted to lower
the limits of the kind

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.925 align:middle line:84%
of the top level of
vitamins that are allowed.

00:08:11.925 --> 00:08:13.726 align:middle line:90%
And then aside from that,

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:16.462 align:middle line:84%
they wanted to restrict
certain herbal medicine,

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:19.332 align:middle line:84%
the kind that is
used and enjoyed

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:23.136 align:middle line:84%
and has been demonstrated
to be safe over hundreds

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:90%
and hundreds of years.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.173 align:middle line:84%
You know, things that we
all take like Goldenseal

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:31.277 align:middle line:84%
or Dong quai, you
know, the one that's

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:35.281 align:middle line:84%
so many women take during
menopause et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.151 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Even Akinesia under
thread, all of these kinds

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.620 align:middle line:90%
of things, and homeopathy next.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.892 align:middle line:84%
So, this is a concerted campaign
against natural medicine

00:08:45.892 --> 00:08:49.062 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to come to
this shores too in America.

00:08:49.062 --> 00:08:50.930 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, how far
have they gotten in terms

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.633 align:middle line:84%
of their attempts
in the UK and EU?

00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, the EU has
definitely passed some laws

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.439 align:middle line:90%
about limiting certain vitamins.

00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:03.209 align:middle line:84%
What they haven't set are
the upper limits as to how,

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.412 align:middle line:84%
you know, how much we can
have in each supplement.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:09.182 align:middle line:84%
So, that is under
discussion and debate.

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:09.916 align:middle line:90%
And certain--

00:09:09.916 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Its [inaudible].

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.951 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Well, yes.

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:15.054 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it'd be crazy and it's
a little bit like prohibition.

00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:18.091 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you do that
you're going to simply unleash,

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.025 align:middle line:90%
you know, the unlicensed--

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:19.792 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Huge black
market, you bet.

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:21.194 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes, exactly.

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:23.096 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: People I'm going
to stop taking them.

00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.497 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: No.

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:25.999 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: They'll just find more
creative ways of procuring them.

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.166 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Exactly.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.602 align:middle line:84%
But we found that certain
things like certain

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.804 align:middle line:84%
of those herbs are
off the shelves now.

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:32.572 align:middle line:90%
And there's--

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:33.606 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Which ones?

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.174 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, it's
harder to get things

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:36.509 align:middle line:84%
like Goldenseal,
now that it was.

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And seriously,

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.045 align:middle line:84%
things that directly
impact the immune system

00:09:39.045 --> 00:09:42.749 align:middle line:84%
and really would go up against
the antibiotics industry, right?

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:43.683 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Exactly.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:44.851 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
attacking.

00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:45.485 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oh, that's so sad.

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:46.552 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: I know.

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:49.989 align:middle line:84%
But there is a big
blow back now going on.

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:53.293 align:middle line:84%
And there are, you know, there
are hundreds of thousands

00:09:53.293 --> 00:09:56.562 align:middle line:84%
of people, if not millions
of people in the EU

00:09:56.562 --> 00:10:00.833 align:middle line:84%
who enjoyed these products and
are trying to fight against it.

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:05.171 align:middle line:84%
But this has been going on
since-- actually, since 2003.

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:08.141 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, it's
coming to America.

00:10:08.141 --> 00:10:12.011 align:middle line:84%
It's coming to the world
because there are similar laws

00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:17.350 align:middle line:84%
that are being attempted to be
passed by Codex Alimentarius

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.953 align:middle line:84%
which is the big committee
inside the United Nations.

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:22.822 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We've been hearing
about that for a while.

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:25.458 align:middle line:84%
Talk about that because I
kind of dropped the thread

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:28.594 align:middle line:84%
of that story a couple of years
ago and haven't picked it up.

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:31.164 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, I think the
bottom line is Regina

00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:32.565 align:middle line:90%
that it's very similar.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:90%
They're trying to do the same.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.703 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to limit
the kinds of vitamins

00:10:36.703 --> 00:10:42.241 align:middle line:84%
that you can get to the kind of
mass produced synthetic versions

00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:44.677 align:middle line:90%
that are created primarily

00:10:44.677 --> 00:10:47.847 align:middle line:84%
by the major companies,
the large companies.

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:50.316 align:middle line:90%
So, that would again, squeeze

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:54.887 align:middle line:84%
out the small innovative
natural products, you know,

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:58.191 align:middle line:84%
or natural companies who
devoted to natural products

00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:01.394 align:middle line:84%
that are the ones that are
really involved in wellness.

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:04.397 align:middle line:84%
And as well, they're trying to
cap the sealing on, you know,

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:06.299 align:middle line:90%
the level of vitamins.

00:11:06.299 --> 00:11:09.902 align:middle line:84%
So, and these are
powerful concerted efforts.

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:12.305 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: How does that
even work when you're--

00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:17.276 align:middle line:84%
when they're asking to have some
kind of standardization on herbs

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:20.747 align:middle line:84%
which grow naturally different,
soils affect them according

00:11:20.747 --> 00:11:24.584 align:middle line:84%
to season and, you know,
you have very few deaths

00:11:24.584 --> 00:11:28.154 align:middle line:84%
that are attributed to
vitamins, minerals, and herbs

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:31.958 align:middle line:84%
and homeopathy for example
compared to allopathic medicine

00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.694 align:middle line:84%
which is hundreds of
thousands of deaths a year?

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.765 align:middle line:84%
How do they even suppose
that can be tested no less

00:11:38.765 --> 00:11:42.168 align:middle line:84%
than in these very sterile
multi-billion dollar labs?

00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:45.271 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Once again, they
do it by standardizing it

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:47.840 align:middle line:84%
by creating a drug
of these herbs.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.643 align:middle line:84%
So, what they do is
take isolate the--

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:55.948 align:middle line:84%
you know, the active ingredient
and then cheapen the herb

00:11:55.948 --> 00:11:59.352 align:middle line:84%
by taking away a lot of
those secondary elements

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:02.421 align:middle line:84%
that really make it
work synergistically.

00:12:02.421 --> 00:12:04.457 align:middle line:84%
So, that's essentially
what they're looking

00:12:04.457 --> 00:12:09.762 align:middle line:84%
to is basically creating
drugs of vitamins and herbs.

00:12:09.762 --> 00:12:12.665 align:middle line:84%
So, I think it's really
important for people

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:16.068 align:middle line:84%
to make some noise about
this because this is going

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:20.039 align:middle line:84%
to affect everybody in the
natural medicine community

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:22.775 align:middle line:84%
and all of those millions
of people who stay well

00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.143 align:middle line:90%
through these products.

00:12:24.143 --> 00:12:25.878 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What about
backyard gardens

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:28.881 align:middle line:84%
and certain edible herbs
comprehend these sorts

00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:30.249 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:31.884 align:middle line:84%
Are they going after any of
those common things that we grow

00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:35.321 align:middle line:84%
in our backyard if the person
themselves is growing them?

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.423 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: No, you can't
legislate against that.

00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:38.658 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Good.

00:12:38.658 --> 00:12:39.826 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Unless you have,
you know, the police coming

00:12:39.826 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
around you, knocking
on everybody's store.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.395 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.629 align:middle line:84%
So, really, I mean it's
coming down to having

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:47.266 align:middle line:84%
to basically plant your own
herbal medicinal garden.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:50.169 align:middle line:84%
And I know a lot of people are
doing that certainly in the west

00:12:50.169 --> 00:12:51.671 align:middle line:90%
in America will have started.

00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:52.471 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, it needs
good sense.

00:12:52.471 --> 00:12:53.673 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:12:53.673 --> 00:12:55.374 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I mean, if the kind
of crackdown comes here

00:12:55.374 --> 00:12:58.177 align:middle line:90%
that is threatened in Europe.

00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:02.148 align:middle line:84%
But as I say, there are many,
many people fighting back.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
important for all of us

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.686 align:middle line:84%
to shout pretty loudly
right now.

00:13:06.686 --> 00:13:07.887 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, I've heard a story

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:10.223 align:middle line:84%
that I thought it was very
encouraging, you know,

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:11.724 align:middle line:90%
it made me whoop it up anyway.

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.727 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't mention
who's going to be doing this

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:16.762 align:middle line:84%
but there is going to
be some testing going

00:13:16.762 --> 00:13:19.632 align:middle line:84%
on with a very sophisticated
piece of machinery

00:13:19.632 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
that shows the full spectrum
of everything in foods

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.739 align:middle line:84%
and in supplements
basically anything you wish

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.007 align:middle line:90%
to put under the scope.

00:13:28.007 --> 00:13:30.943 align:middle line:84%
It takes kind of special
reading and technical ability

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:34.747 align:middle line:84%
to assess it and that's going
to be released publicly.

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:38.818 align:middle line:84%
So, you find out what
fillers, what kind of toxins

00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.822 align:middle line:84%
and so forth are embedded in
all of the large manufactures

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:46.459 align:middle line:84%
of pharmaceuticals but also
even vitamin manufacturers

00:13:46.459 --> 00:13:48.361 align:middle line:84%
who are putting out the
really cheap synthetic stuff

00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle line:84%
and not caring about
life force and affect

00:13:51.998 --> 00:13:53.633 align:middle line:90%
on the public at large.

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:54.767 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: That would be fabulous

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.569 align:middle line:84%
because it'll finally
demonstrate

00:13:56.569 --> 00:14:00.072 align:middle line:84%
to people what these supposed
supplements are made of.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:03.075 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's really
important for people to have

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:06.846 align:middle line:84%
as much information as possible
and to understand that a lot

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:10.116 align:middle line:84%
of so many products get
put out there on the market

00:14:10.116 --> 00:14:12.551 align:middle line:84%
without us having the truth
about what's actually in them.

00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:16.188 align:middle line:84%
And that goes for personal
care products as well.

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:17.023 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:14:17.023 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: And home products as well

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.859 align:middle line:84%
as the stuff we put
in our mouths.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.561 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, a lot of
greenwashing going on too.

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:24.363 align:middle line:84%
So, we have to watch
out for that one

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:26.766 align:middle line:84%
because those claims they
may have one natural item

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:29.702 align:middle line:84%
and a bucket load of
garbage otherwise.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.004 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about where you
just mentioned a moment ago

00:14:32.004 --> 00:14:34.106 align:middle line:84%
which is how this
stuff is put out there.

00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:37.343 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
marketing money out there

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:38.978 align:middle line:90%
for this, a lot of spin.

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:41.747 align:middle line:84%
And you and I were talking off
camera about that a little bit

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:45.217 align:middle line:84%
and one of the subjects which
really as you going is Gardasil.

00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how
something is spun?

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.455 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: OK.

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:53.059 align:middle line:84%
Well, Gardasil is supposedly
the cervical cancer vaccine

00:14:53.059 --> 00:14:56.429 align:middle line:84%
and it was launched
several years ago.

00:14:56.429 --> 00:15:00.733 align:middle line:84%
And the way that they did it
was possibly the most cynical,

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.501 align:middle line:84%
you know, thing that
I've ever seen.

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:10.242 align:middle line:84%
The drug company created a
television ad campaign directed

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:13.145 align:middle line:84%
right to the 12-year-olds
that they are targeting

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:16.482 align:middle line:84%
with that vaccine
bypassing their parents.

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:19.085 align:middle line:84%
They made it look cool
to get this vaccine.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.887 align:middle line:84%
The whole catch line
was one less, you know,

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:22.822 align:middle line:90%
I want to be one less dead.

00:15:22.822 --> 00:15:23.956 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Like one less dead, yeah.

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:26.092 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yeah, with
cervical cancer.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.627 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it was
appalling because first

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:30.963 align:middle line:90%
of all it was total spin.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:34.033 align:middle line:84%
The vaccine doesn't
prevent cervical cancer.

00:15:34.033 --> 00:15:38.371 align:middle line:84%
It just targets certain
two strains of the virus

00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:90%
that may 'cause cervical cancer.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.843 align:middle line:84%
So, and it doesn't
actually work very well.

00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So, all of that was just
probably, you know, it reached,

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:84%
you know, a drug
company reached its nadir

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:55.821 align:middle line:84%
in attempting to
market a product.

00:15:55.821 --> 00:15:59.191 align:middle line:84%
What this goes on all the
time and of course in America

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:02.628 align:middle line:84%
where they're allowed to
market drugs on the air.

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:03.996 align:middle line:90%
This happens all the time.

00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:06.799 align:middle line:84%
It's just about the case with
every drug-- the every drug.

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.834 align:middle line:90%
It's new spin over science.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:10.703 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But that was
particularly reprehensible

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:11.771 align:middle line:90%
that they were going

00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:13.339 align:middle line:84%
after basically old
[inaudible] set you.

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.608 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Pubescent people.

00:16:15.608 --> 00:16:17.910 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yes, absolutely,
absolutely.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.246 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And their parent and
of course [inaudible], "Mom,

00:16:20.246 --> 00:16:22.148 align:middle line:90%
I need to get the vaccine.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:25.017 align:middle line:84%
And even if their parents did
not agree to it, you know,

00:16:25.017 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
just to create this kind
of popularization of it.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.621 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:16:28.621 --> 00:16:29.588 align:middle line:90%
"Mom, I don't want to die."

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:30.556 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:31.090 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You know,
with the whole idea.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.291 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:32.825 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to say
to your daughter, right?

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:33.793 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:16:33.793 --> 00:16:35.027 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: But it wasn't
just daughters.

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.996 align:middle line:84%
I mean, HPV and the vaccine
they were also trying--

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.898 align:middle line:84%
were they trying to enlist
boys for that as well?

00:16:38.898 --> 00:16:39.598 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:40.599 align:middle line:90%
Well, they wanted to--

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:43.269 align:middle line:84%
they started marketing
it to boys too.

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.438 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, this is
a little touchy.

00:16:45.438 --> 00:16:46.906 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were going
to talk about this

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.908 align:middle line:90%
about Michael Douglas.

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:50.209 align:middle line:90%
And the whole-- all of the--

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:51.544 align:middle line:90%
[ Laughter ]

00:16:51.544 --> 00:16:56.482 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, the media around
throat cancer and all of that.

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:56.982 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.317 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:58.317 --> 00:16:59.718 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Is that just something
that is so much more hype

00:16:59.718 --> 00:17:02.855 align:middle line:84%
or are there really big
statistics to support

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:06.659 align:middle line:84%
that amount of programming
around the subject too?

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: No.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.595 align:middle line:84%
It's very rare as
you get it orally.

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:10.296 align:middle line:90%
[laughs]

00:17:10.296 --> 00:17:11.663 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah [laughs].

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:13.766 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: It's very rare that you
get it orally and, you know,

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.267 align:middle line:84%
I don't really want
to go there--

00:17:15.267 --> 00:17:16.302 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:17:16.302 --> 00:17:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- as what
he was thinking but,

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.538 align:middle line:90%
you know, in so many ways.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:23.042 align:middle line:84%
There's so many things wrong
with what he was talking about.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:24.744 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to know
where to start.

00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:26.778 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Things that could've
been good for the marriage.

00:17:26.778 --> 00:17:28.447 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: I know, exactly.

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:30.683 align:middle line:90%
So, but I think, you know,

00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:34.954 align:middle line:84%
the real problem here is the
classic thing that goes on with

00:17:34.954 --> 00:17:38.958 align:middle line:84%
so many vaccines
which is first of all,

00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.127 align:middle line:84%
the vaccine where
is very imperfectly

00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:45.064 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't really
cure cancer.

00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:47.533 align:middle line:90%
That's total hype, total hype.

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.335 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't prevent cancer.

00:17:49.335 --> 00:17:52.538 align:middle line:84%
It prevents two strains
of a load of HPV.

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:55.407 align:middle line:90%
And certainly doesn't go

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:58.978 align:middle line:84%
after the vast majority
of cervical cancer.

00:17:58.978 --> 00:18:01.947 align:middle line:84%
And the vaccine has
so many side effects.

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:03.282 align:middle line:90%
I've spoken with many,

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:06.786 align:middle line:84%
many parents who's
children either died or--

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:07.853 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:09.855 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- were damaged
from this vaccine.

00:18:09.855 --> 00:18:13.359 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- to do something
like this as you say,

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:16.195 align:middle line:90%
the word is reprehensible.

00:18:16.195 --> 00:18:18.664 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: How the-- has
there been in the backlash

00:18:18.664 --> 00:18:21.300 align:middle line:84%
and that the numbers
of girls being taken

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.435 align:middle line:90%
in for this vaccine has dropped?

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:26.539 align:middle line:84%
Since, some of the deaths were
publicized or is still going?

00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.909 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: No, in America
the numbers have dropped.

00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:33.779 align:middle line:84%
In the UK where there's been a
blackout from that information,

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:37.316 align:middle line:84%
there was barely
anybody making any kind

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:40.019 align:middle line:84%
of noise except what
doctors don't tell you

00:18:40.019 --> 00:18:41.487 align:middle line:90%
against that vaccine.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:44.323 align:middle line:84%
I mean we published a big
story, the selling of Gardasil,

00:18:44.323 --> 00:18:47.259 align:middle line:84%
and revealed the
whole story from--

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:50.529 align:middle line:84%
and all of the information
about even doctors

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:52.264 align:middle line:84%
who were complaining
about that vaccine

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:56.001 align:middle line:84%
because they're seeing the
carnage that's going on.

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:59.905 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Let's talk a little
bit about terse in general.

00:18:59.905 --> 00:19:02.575 align:middle line:84%
The British Medical
Association itself say it only

00:19:02.575 --> 00:19:06.278 align:middle line:84%
about like 12 percent or-- is
it the British Medical Journal?

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:06.912 align:middle line:90%
Yeah--

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:08.113 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah, yes.

00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:11.383 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Said about 12
percent of the various drugs

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:13.686 align:middle line:90%
and therapies actually work.

00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:17.890 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yes, have been
proven to work, absolutely.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.527 align:middle line:84%
They looked at all of
the major treatments

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:24.063 align:middle line:84%
and that includes not just
drugs but other treatments.

00:19:24.063 --> 00:19:25.497 align:middle line:90%
And they were really talking

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:84%
about how much is
actually been proven to be

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.537 align:middle line:84%
and they studied all of the
literature around these studies

00:19:31.537 --> 00:19:34.306 align:middle line:84%
and yeah, you're talking
about just 12 percent.

00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:35.574 align:middle line:90%
Now--

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:37.209 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And subjecting
ourselves to these things with--

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:40.880 align:middle line:84%
these horrendous side effects
for a 12 percent chance

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.617 align:middle line:84%
of a natural cure or
reversal symptoms anyway.

00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:46.385 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You know, it's
really hard for us

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
to accept this because,
you know,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.724 align:middle line:84%
we really have built our
lives around the idea

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:55.494 align:middle line:84%
that medicine is a science and
that, you know, we like to have

00:19:55.494 --> 00:19:58.497 align:middle line:84%
that kind of certainty
and we believe, you know,

00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:01.133 align:middle line:84%
doctors are working with
well proven products

00:20:01.133 --> 00:20:05.037 align:middle line:84%
and we have the FDA
and other organizations

00:20:05.037 --> 00:20:07.039 align:middle line:90%
that really study this stuff.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:11.176 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, and make sure
that these things are safe.

00:20:11.176 --> 00:20:17.116 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line is this is a
highly, highly corrupt industry

00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:19.418 align:middle line:90%
with the vast majority--

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:24.023 align:middle line:84%
vast majority of its products
have not, and the vast majority

00:20:24.023 --> 00:20:25.424 align:middle line:90%
of the treatments we take

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:28.661 align:middle line:84%
for granted have never
been proven to work.

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:32.631 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to say it, but the
vast majority are nothing more

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.401 align:middle line:90%
than 21st century voodoo.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:37.169 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:20:37.169 --> 00:20:40.606 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And so, it's, you know,
it's quite frightening that--

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:44.043 align:middle line:84%
but, the other half of
that coin, the other side

00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:48.881 align:middle line:84%
of that coin is that
there's an enormous body

00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.551 align:middle line:84%
of evidence demonstrating
the efficacy and the safety

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:54.486 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of natural medicine.

00:20:54.486 --> 00:20:55.754 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:20:55.754 --> 00:20:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Everything from ancient
systems like acupuncture

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.929 align:middle line:84%
and homeopathy to or-- older
systems like homeopathy to--

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:06.532 align:middle line:84%
very cutting edge things
in energy medicine.

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:09.301 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And we're going to
talk about the energy medicine

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.870 align:middle line:84%
in a bit but I'm-- I--
what about the system,

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:84%
the British system of medicine
compared to American system

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.809 align:middle line:84%
where you have more
nationalized [inaudible].

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Were-- how does--

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:24.516 align:middle line:84%
I can understand in a privatized
system and systems of HBO--

00:21:24.516 --> 00:21:28.020 align:middle line:84%
HMOs-- HBO [laughs], where you
would have a massive amount

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.154 align:middle line:90%
of corruption, there's a--

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:31.890 align:middle line:84%
a lot entities have a
lot to gain from that.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.728 align:middle line:84%
But, how does it work in Britain
when such a high percentage

00:21:35.728 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
of the doctors are
actually working

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.433 align:middle line:84%
under governmental
medical programs.

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:45.537 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You know, we always
say it's not the carpenter,

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:47.072 align:middle line:90%
it's his tools, you know,

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:49.808 align:middle line:84%
we don't think the bad
guys here are doctors.

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:53.846 align:middle line:84%
We think doctors are in the
main trying to do their best,

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:56.849 align:middle line:84%
trying to cure people,
trying to use what they can.

00:21:56.849 --> 00:21:59.184 align:middle line:84%
The problem is not
him, it's his tools.

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:03.288 align:middle line:84%
The tools that they are given
are basically surgery and drugs.

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:08.127 align:middle line:84%
And drugs in-- and also of
course medical products,

00:22:08.127 --> 00:22:10.295 align:middle line:84%
drugs are our business,
there are big--

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:11.096 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:22:11.096 --> 00:22:12.231 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: -- corrupt business.

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:13.565 align:middle line:84%
They're one of the most
profitable businesses

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:14.967 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:22.241 align:middle line:84%
And drug companies have vast
or missive people to put a lot

00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:24.810 align:middle line:84%
of spin on their products,
to make them look better

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.279 align:middle line:84%
than they are, safer
than they are.

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:30.883 align:middle line:84%
And that corruption goes
all through the line

00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:33.652 align:middle line:84%
and they have a lot of good
friends in government agencies.

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:36.555 align:middle line:84%
And so, these products
get put on the market.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:39.625 align:middle line:84%
And doctors get educated
by drug companies.

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:40.859 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:43.429 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You know, drug detail
men as they call them go

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:45.697 align:middle line:84%
into doctors offices
and tell them

00:22:45.697 --> 00:22:47.399 align:middle line:90%
about their latest treatments.

00:22:47.399 --> 00:22:51.103 align:middle line:84%
And so, and they're
even given free samples

00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:52.304 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of induces.

00:22:52.304 --> 00:22:53.739 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, it's pretty
much the same there,

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:54.673 align:middle line:84%
is it is in the United
States, yeah.

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:55.974 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Oh, absolutely.

00:22:55.974 --> 00:22:58.977 align:middle line:84%
It's international
western medicine now.

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:01.613 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, the
medical literature is there

00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:06.785 align:middle line:84%
for a reason, it's there to show
doctors around the world what,

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:09.421 align:middle line:84%
you know, what is
being studied in drugs.

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:13.392 align:middle line:84%
So, that's the kind of medicine
that everybody from the US

00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:17.396 align:middle line:84%
to China is going to use in
terms of allopathic medicine.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.164 align:middle line:90%
So, we have the same issues,

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.633 align:middle line:84%
the only thing we don't have
is doctors that were paid

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:23.302 align:middle line:90%
as much in the public set--

00:23:23.302 --> 00:23:23.936 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:23:23.936 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: -- sector.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.474 align:middle line:90%
But, they use the same tools.

00:23:28.474 --> 00:23:30.042 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well' they have
been very successful.

00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:31.376 align:middle line:90%
The pharmaceutical companies

00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:33.312 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's
the largest lobby

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:36.181 align:middle line:84%
or second largest lobby
in the United States.

00:23:36.181 --> 00:23:38.917 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Oh, absolutely and
they have managed to get lots

00:23:38.917 --> 00:23:44.223 align:middle line:84%
of people to turn a blind eye
to some of the dangers of,

00:23:44.223 --> 00:23:46.859 align:middle line:84%
you know, of these
drugs, of these tools.

00:23:46.859 --> 00:23:51.663 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we felt compelled
to bring this out in a magazine

00:23:51.663 --> 00:23:53.999 align:middle line:90%
because we felt somebody had

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:57.135 align:middle line:84%
to make this private
conversation public,

00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:58.437 align:middle line:90%
because that's the thing,

00:23:58.437 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
medicine is a private
conversation.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.209 align:middle line:84%
We read the medical literature,
our team of researchers

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:09.715 align:middle line:84%
and we study what goes on
and we see shocking stuff

00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:11.083 align:middle line:90%
in the medical literature.

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:14.820 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of stories saying,
you know, we've done this study

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.389 align:middle line:84%
and this drug doesn't work
or this drug harms people

00:24:17.389 --> 00:24:20.459 align:middle line:84%
or this procedure really
isn't necessary, you know,

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:22.461 align:middle line:84%
this mammograms,
they're not necessary

00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.931 align:middle line:84%
and they're actually dangerous
or something like that.

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:30.169 align:middle line:84%
Now, that never gets
relayed to patients.

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:31.136 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No it doesn't.

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.538 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: That private
conservation.

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:35.941 align:middle line:84%
So, all we're doing is taking
medicines private conversation

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.509 align:middle line:90%
and making that public.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:39.344 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, and also
the studies themselves

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:43.882 align:middle line:84%
which they rely on to basically
frighten the populous of large

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:46.952 align:middle line:84%
into going a certain direction
in terms of medical care.

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:49.821 align:middle line:84%
Those are highly
fraudulent in a lot of cases.

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, some of them
have been busted

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.594 align:middle line:84%
where they simply remove
the elements of the study

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:58.463 align:middle line:84%
that show the problematic
nature of their drugs.

00:24:58.463 --> 00:25:02.401 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, they cherry pick
and they based their statistics

00:25:02.401 --> 00:25:05.504 align:middle line:84%
on a couple of them that
may have actually benefited.

00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:07.339 align:middle line:84%
Why are more of these
guys in jail,

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.641 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why this--
they haven't been prosecuted

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:12.311 align:middle line:84%
and send to jail, because
this is common practice.

00:25:12.311 --> 00:25:13.645 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, as you
say it's kind

00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:17.516 align:middle line:84%
of infiltrated the whole system
is-- has been infiltrated.

00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:20.886 align:middle line:84%
I mean what happens
with most drug companies

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:24.890 align:middle line:84%
and drugs being tested
is they get tested.

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is well know, this
is written about in things

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.262 align:middle line:84%
like the British
Medical Journal and the--

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:34.166 align:middle line:84%
you know, in the land
set and the journal

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:37.069 align:middle line:84%
of the American Medical
Association all know of,

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:39.905 align:middle line:84%
write about and worry
about this problem.

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:90%
When the drug gets studied,

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:46.778 align:middle line:84%
the drug company then hires
a specialist medical public

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:52.017 align:middle line:84%
relations person to put spin
on that study, to lose some

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:55.387 align:middle line:84%
or minimize some of the
negative elements of the study.

00:25:55.387 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:84%
They then scout around for a
prestigious doctor or some kind

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.395 align:middle line:84%
of person in the
medical community

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:05.697 align:middle line:90%
to put his or her name to this.

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:09.901 align:middle line:84%
So, these-- these papers
which are basically PR dressed

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:13.705 align:middle line:84%
up as research, then make their
way to the medical journals.

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:18.276 align:middle line:84%
And that recently some
organizations in medicine

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:21.113 align:middle line:84%
who have been alarmed by
this recon that something

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:24.983 align:middle line:84%
like 75 percent, three
quarters of everything published

00:26:24.983 --> 00:26:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in the medical literature
is written by PR people.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.023 align:middle line:90%
Three quarters, three quarters.

00:26:31.023 --> 00:26:32.357 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Interesting.

00:26:32.357 --> 00:26:35.694 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: So, I mean this is
completely appalling, you know,

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:40.165 align:middle line:84%
it's completely shocking and
that's the kind of stuff upon

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:41.867 align:middle line:90%
which your doctor is going

00:26:41.867 --> 00:26:44.670 align:middle line:84%
to base his decision
as to your care.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.372 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And then in
addition if you back it

00:26:47.372 --> 00:26:50.575 align:middle line:84%
up a little further-- oh,
well number of years ago

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.544 align:middle line:84%
when I was doing
investigative reporting--

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:55.247 align:middle line:90%
I won't name the university now,

00:26:55.247 --> 00:26:57.349 align:middle line:84%
but there was a prominent
university,

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:59.818 align:middle line:84%
a large medical program
and I happen

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:01.153 align:middle line:90%
to have been given access--

00:27:01.153 --> 00:27:03.689 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how the
person procured it,

00:27:03.689 --> 00:27:06.191 align:middle line:84%
a list of the funders
for all the departments

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:07.926 align:middle line:90%
and various studies.

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:13.398 align:middle line:84%
In every single case I
didn't see any exceptions.

00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:18.770 align:middle line:84%
The person or the corporation
or group, non-profit,

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.273 align:middle line:84%
whatever that was
funding it had something

00:27:21.273 --> 00:27:23.141 align:middle line:90%
to gain from the outcome.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:25.110 align:middle line:90%
So, every single one had a point

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.245 align:middle line:84%
of view before the
research ever began.

00:27:27.245 --> 00:27:30.849 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Oh, absolutely and
I mean virtually, you know,

00:27:30.849 --> 00:27:34.519 align:middle line:84%
almost all of the medical
literature about drugs is funded

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:37.355 align:middle line:84%
by the drug companies
who themselves, you know,

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:39.057 align:middle line:90%
stand to gain by the--

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:39.991 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:40.692 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- sales of
their product.

00:27:40.692 --> 00:27:41.893 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:45.130 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: So, again the whole
system is highly corrupt

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.133 align:middle line:84%
and it really needs to
be dismantled and set.

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing occurs
in Britain, you know,

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:57.109 align:middle line:84%
it has no difference, because
again the doctors based the use

00:27:57.109 --> 00:28:00.278 align:middle line:84%
of their, you know, the
base to your decisions

00:28:00.278 --> 00:28:02.547 align:middle line:84%
on the medical literature
and on what were--

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:03.915 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:05.417 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- been told by the drug
companies and there is that,

00:28:05.417 --> 00:28:09.321 align:middle line:84%
you know, there is that
suspect research all the time.

00:28:09.321 --> 00:28:10.689 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:84%
At least that we've come to
laugh about the disclaimers--

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.426 align:middle line:84%
if you see a television
ad we can laugh it off

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.294 align:middle line:90%
but people still buy this stuff.

00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:20.065 align:middle line:84%
And partly because if you
are under the umbrella

00:28:20.065 --> 00:28:23.101 align:middle line:84%
of an HMO you get
what they give you.

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:25.837 align:middle line:84%
And as you say the tools are
extremely prejudiced towards

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:28.106 align:middle line:84%
what you ever has
been buying, you know,

00:28:28.106 --> 00:28:30.609 align:middle line:90%
kind of forced on them.

00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:31.710 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.613 align:middle line:84%
And now, there is this
concerted campaign,

00:28:34.613 --> 00:28:39.017 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutically backed to try
to eliminate any alternatives.

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:44.256 align:middle line:84%
But, you know, happily despite
that very grim picture more

00:28:44.256 --> 00:28:46.057 align:middle line:90%
and more young doctors coming

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:48.593 align:middle line:84%
to the floor are getting
interested in, you know,

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:49.928 align:middle line:84%
what they call functional
medicines.

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:51.229 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:53.665 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You know, the use of
natural substances to heal

00:28:53.665 --> 00:28:56.268 align:middle line:84%
and they're seeing that
these tools don't work

00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and that they need
better alternatives.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.137 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, that's really--

00:28:59.137 --> 00:28:59.971 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And they are
looking for it.

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:00.505 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- the saving grace, yes.

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.940 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.942 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And getting multiple
degrees in MD that we go ahead

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:09.548 align:middle line:84%
and become licensed in
homeopathy or naturopath

00:29:09.548 --> 00:29:12.884 align:middle line:84%
against naturopath status
and I'm seeing a lot of that.

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:13.952 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:15.353 align:middle line:84%
And it's-- I mean
it's not before time,

00:29:15.353 --> 00:29:18.857 align:middle line:84%
because I mean we have to
realize that 70 percent

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:23.094 align:middle line:84%
of Americans for instance are
on at least one medication.

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:26.231 align:middle line:84%
And many of them on
many medications,

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:31.970 align:middle line:84%
and the final statistics in the
level of illness here, you know,

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.106 align:middle line:84%
is the final story, it's
not only not doing any good

00:29:35.106 --> 00:29:38.243 align:middle line:84%
and then the main is, you
know, is harming people.

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:43.114 align:middle line:84%
You know, the other horrible
statistic is, you know,

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:84%
I heard that this
wonderful statistics

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.886 align:middle line:84%
that actually you are
three times more--

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:50.188 align:middle line:84%
I think, no six times
more likely to be killed

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:52.324 align:middle line:90%
by your doctor than by a gun.

00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:53.592 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, absolutely.

00:29:53.592 --> 00:29:54.593 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: In the [inaudible]--
so, there are--

00:29:54.593 --> 00:29:55.894 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: It's true.

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.195 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- you know, lots of
statistics showing that--

00:29:57.195 --> 00:29:58.697 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: We need to disarm them.

00:29:58.697 --> 00:30:00.332 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes, that, you know,

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:03.702 align:middle line:84%
modern medicine is the
fourth leading cause of death

00:30:03.702 --> 00:30:06.805 align:middle line:84%
after heart disease,
stroke and cancer.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, with all of these
terrible statistics,

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.546 align:middle line:84%
you have to really get that
modern medicine isn't working.

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:19.351 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, our job is
really to try to not only look

00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:23.255 align:middle line:84%
at very critically, you
know, particular medicine

00:30:23.255 --> 00:30:25.824 align:middle line:84%
for particular conditions,
but also to say,

00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:28.159 align:middle line:90%
"OK, what to do instead."

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:32.497 align:middle line:84%
What else works and we try to
subject alternative medicine,

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:34.633 align:middle line:84%
natural medicine to the
same kind of scrutiny

00:30:34.633 --> 00:30:36.001 align:middle line:84%
that we give conventional
medicine.

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:37.602 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, that was kind of
what I was going to ask you

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:41.172 align:middle line:84%
about next, because on
the other hand you have--

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:43.909 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you go to a
natural life expo, my God,

00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:46.978 align:middle line:84%
there are thousands
and thousands

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:49.080 align:middle line:84%
of booth selling the
exact same products.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.751 align:middle line:84%
And again, because it isn't
standardized I mean thank God,

00:30:52.751 --> 00:30:55.687 align:middle line:84%
but because it is you
can make a lot of claims.

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:56.655 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:30:56.655 --> 00:30:58.156 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: So, how--
what are you finding

00:30:58.156 --> 00:31:02.127 align:middle line:84%
in doing your do
diligence toward the natural

00:31:02.127 --> 00:31:04.663 align:middle line:90%
medical community.

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:08.400 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, first of all we
expose when there are products.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.634 align:middle line:90%
We'd look at natural products--

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:11.036 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And get nasty products.

00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:13.638 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- as well as, you know,
as well as natural treatments.

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And when there are
products that claim

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.276 align:middle line:84%
that they are 100 percent
natural, we'll disclose when--

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:21.813 align:middle line:84%
when it's not when they're
actually parabens in there or,

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:25.717 align:middle line:84%
you know, sodium lauryl
sulfate or anyone of a number

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:30.622 align:middle line:84%
of potentially dangerous
chemicals will expose that too.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:33.825 align:middle line:84%
And if the treatment has said--
well, it's proven to work

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:37.595 align:middle line:84%
or if a treatment has nothing to
demonstrate that it, you know,

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.531 align:middle line:84%
that it works, no
evidence to show

00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:41.766 align:middle line:84%
that it works will
say-- will say so.

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:43.969 align:middle line:84%
We try to be very
even handed with that

00:31:43.969 --> 00:31:46.004 align:middle line:84%
and basically we just
want to say, "OK,

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:47.539 align:middle line:90%
what works and what doesn't?"

00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:48.873 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:51.242 align:middle line:84%
This is off the top my head,
but it's a bugaboo and a lot

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:54.012 align:middle line:84%
of people look for
this magnesium steroid.

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:56.281 align:middle line:84%
Is that on your no,
no list because it is

00:31:56.281 --> 00:31:58.416 align:middle line:84%
in so many vitamins and
there's some evidence

00:31:58.416 --> 00:31:59.985 align:middle line:90%
that it's not good to--

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:02.253 align:middle line:84%
for us to be ingesting
magnesium steroids--

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:03.288 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:04.155 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- especially
that the base of--

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.557 align:middle line:84%
a hand full of different
vitamins

00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:07.492 align:middle line:84%
that a person is
taking in a day.

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:08.893 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes I mean there's a lot
of what they call excipients,

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, with little
bits of things and added.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.167 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:17.435 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And you have
to look at that too.

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:21.606 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's really
concerning the idea that large,

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:24.676 align:middle line:84%
large companies would
take over and produce--

00:32:24.676 --> 00:32:26.411 align:middle line:90%
mass produced vitamins.

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:29.647 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, they
have to add these excipients,

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:32.417 align:middle line:84%
this added-- add the things
which will cause problems.

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:37.989 align:middle line:84%
And there's also certain
kinds of versions of vitamins

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:40.258 align:middle line:84%
that are good and
certain kinds that aren't.

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:43.395 align:middle line:84%
I mean they now know
that only certain kinds

00:32:43.395 --> 00:32:45.030 align:middle line:90%
of vitamin E are healthy for you

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.766 align:middle line:84%
and other kinds are
cancer promoting.

00:32:47.766 --> 00:32:49.934 align:middle line:84%
So, it's really important
to stay on top of that kind

00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:51.903 align:middle line:84%
of information to
which we tried to do.

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:53.705 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, you do a
beautiful job on it.

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:54.406 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Thanks.

00:32:54.406 --> 00:32:55.807 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: I think it's--

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:59.611 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously it's ordered
toward natural cures in general.

00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:00.145 align:middle line:90%
Natural--

00:33:00.145 --> 00:33:01.446 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Sure.

00:33:01.446 --> 00:33:02.814 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- yes, natural
treatments, natural products

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:06.384 align:middle line:84%
and alternative products of
various kinds, but I did notice

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:09.521 align:middle line:84%
that you do, do the
diligence in there.

00:33:09.521 --> 00:33:10.955 align:middle line:84%
So, that's-- I want
to-- sad to say that

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:12.924 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: We tried to and
we tried to say, yeah,

00:33:12.924 --> 00:33:15.427 align:middle line:84%
we try to also say,
it's horses for courses

00:33:15.427 --> 00:33:16.895 align:middle line:90%
because I will say right now.

00:33:16.895 --> 00:33:18.963 align:middle line:84%
If I walk out of here
and a building falls

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:21.266 align:middle line:84%
on me I want the best
of high-tech medicine

00:33:21.266 --> 00:33:22.333 align:middle line:90%
to put me back together again.

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:23.034 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Absolutely.

00:33:23.034 --> 00:33:24.202 align:middle line:90%
For trauma, it's great.

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:25.236 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:33:25.236 --> 00:33:26.671 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: It's perfect,
it's unparalleled

00:33:26.671 --> 00:33:30.308 align:middle line:84%
but for almost every
chronic disease there--

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:32.877 align:middle line:84%
modern medicine actually
doesn't cure,

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:35.013 align:middle line:90%
it just suppresses symptoms.

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:38.216 align:middle line:84%
And there are many, many
other cures out there

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:41.119 align:middle line:84%
that are safer and
more effective.

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: One of the areas speaking

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.257 align:middle line:84%
of is various energy
types of technologies.

00:33:46.257 --> 00:33:48.760 align:middle line:84%
There are so many devices out
there, some of them advertise

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.664 align:middle line:84%
in your magazine, scalar
frequency type devices

00:33:52.664 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and what is your take on
that I mean the government--

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.569 align:middle line:84%
how do you come after
them, right?

00:33:57.569 --> 00:33:59.137 align:middle line:90%
It's energy medicine.

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:02.407 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's slipping
between some cracks in terms

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:04.709 align:middle line:90%
of the ability for oversight.

00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:06.111 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:08.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting point
because I will say right now.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.416 align:middle line:84%
I mean I get bombarded
through by other work

00:34:11.416 --> 00:34:14.052 align:middle line:84%
with the field, etcetera,
et cetera.

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:16.020 align:middle line:84%
With people writing
to me saying, "Hey,

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.822 align:middle line:84%
I've harnessed your point
energy" kind of thing.

00:34:18.822 --> 00:34:21.326 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there's a lot
of products that are very,

00:34:21.326 --> 00:34:24.829 align:middle line:84%
very promising and have
some interesting research.

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:29.601 align:middle line:84%
And-- or wonderful
anecdotal evidence to success

00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:31.735 align:middle line:90%
and a big body of success.

00:34:31.735 --> 00:34:35.874 align:middle line:84%
And there's others that
have absolutely no evidence,

00:34:35.874 --> 00:34:39.476 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever and are essentially,
you know, woo woo [phonetic].

00:34:39.476 --> 00:34:43.615 align:middle line:84%
So, there's-- you know, there
are some great things going on.

00:34:43.615 --> 00:34:46.251 align:middle line:90%
And of course when you--

00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:48.720 align:middle line:84%
it comes to energy medicine
it's going to be much harder

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.623 align:middle line:84%
to regulate that, but
on the other hand if--

00:34:51.623 --> 00:34:54.358 align:middle line:84%
when you look at
actual regulation,

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:57.795 align:middle line:84%
our regulatory system isn't
working anyway, you know,

00:34:57.795 --> 00:35:00.431 align:middle line:84%
looking at what it does with
drug companies, you know,

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.433 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't regulate
the dangerous stuff

00:35:02.433 --> 00:35:03.501 align:middle line:90%
that gets put on the market.

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.236 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't prevent it.

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:07.572 align:middle line:84%
There are too many
friends and that--

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:11.843 align:middle line:84%
this has happened really just
in the last two decades, I mean,

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:15.947 align:middle line:84%
I remember doing
stories and exposes

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:20.685 align:middle line:84%
as an investigative reporter
on drugs, certain drugs

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:22.120 align:middle line:84%
and the way drugs
were being tested.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.389 align:middle line:84%
And the FDA back
then and this was

00:35:24.389 --> 00:35:27.559 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s I guess
were the good guys.

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They were going after
corrupted--

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.094 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, they
were once upon a time.

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.229 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yeah, they were
going after corruption

00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:33.598 align:middle line:84%
and now there's just too
many friends in there.

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:37.035 align:middle line:84%
So, they don't regulate
what needs to be regulated,

00:35:37.035 --> 00:35:40.271 align:middle line:84%
but I think what's going to be
interesting if there is an--

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:44.375 align:middle line:84%
a huge crackdown, it will be
the way forward for people

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:84%
in natural medicine to
go to spiritual healers

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.382 align:middle line:84%
or people using emotional
freedom techniques or things

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:53.484 align:middle line:84%
like that, they cannot
be regulated.

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.153 align:middle line:90%
You can't stop that.

00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:56.554 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I mean in the
end where energy--

00:35:56.554 --> 00:36:01.893 align:middle line:84%
you worked with the field I mean
an intention for so many years,

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:04.796 align:middle line:84%
in the end that is
probably going

00:36:04.796 --> 00:36:10.902 align:middle line:84%
to be our greatest ally is A,
our mind, our belief systems,

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:13.338 align:middle line:90%
our ability to hold focus

00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:16.441 align:middle line:84%
on energetically for
a proper outcome.

00:36:16.441 --> 00:36:19.744 align:middle line:84%
I mean it sounds esoteric
in new age but its not,

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:22.513 align:middle line:84%
that's fundamental
ancient doctrines many,

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:25.450 align:middle line:84%
many different systems
of ancient philosophies

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.519 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge knew about these
things, and utilize them.

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:31.089 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Absolutely, and I mean
I think we're coming back

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to that idea, cutting edge
science is showing us why

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.795 align:middle line:84%
allopathic medicine
doesn't work.

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:41.132 align:middle line:84%
Because, the problem is the
allopathic model is based

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:46.037 align:middle line:84%
on a very linear materialistic
view of the body as a batch

00:36:46.037 --> 00:36:49.073 align:middle line:84%
of electricity and
chemical signaling.

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:54.379 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of that, you can
take a drug and it will have--

00:36:54.379 --> 00:36:59.117 align:middle line:84%
it have A that slots
into slot B,

00:36:59.117 --> 00:37:00.652 align:middle line:84%
but the body doesn't
work like that.

00:37:00.652 --> 00:37:01.819 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No.

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:05.823 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Taking a drug
actually hits slot B, C,

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:07.759 align:middle line:90%
D and all the way to Z--

00:37:07.759 --> 00:37:08.893 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:37:08.893 --> 00:37:11.396 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- because we are
a complex interconnected

00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:14.365 align:middle line:90%
dynamic organism.

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:17.368 align:middle line:84%
And we work much
more-- and our--

00:37:17.368 --> 00:37:22.173 align:middle line:84%
the way we operate is much more
holistic and also energetic.

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:25.109 align:middle line:84%
And so, that's why we get
all of the side effects we do

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.278 align:middle line:90%
with drugs is they, you know,

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:30.381 align:middle line:84%
the linear model just doesn't
work and that's why the most--

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:33.184 align:middle line:84%
some of the most exciting
medicine and ideas

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:36.487 align:middle line:84%
about medicine work with
frequency rather than chemicals.

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.189 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: I'm very excited
about some of those.

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:39.390 align:middle line:90%
I've been using a new one--

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.893 align:middle line:84%
I'll mention down the road
because someone gave it

00:37:41.893 --> 00:37:43.528 align:middle line:90%
to me to experiment with.

00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:47.365 align:middle line:84%
Just be on prototype status
but I'll tell you what,

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:50.735 align:middle line:84%
it's a scalar wave device and I
thought I'll try it for sleep,

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:53.705 align:middle line:84%
for deep sleep and I've
been using it about a week

00:37:53.705 --> 00:37:57.208 align:middle line:84%
and I am sleeping like a
baby, you've come up to--

00:37:57.208 --> 00:38:00.578 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason and
drift right back down again.

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.081 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- there
is no side effect.

00:38:03.081 --> 00:38:06.851 align:middle line:84%
It's just a frequency working
with that particular spectrum

00:38:06.851 --> 00:38:08.186 align:middle line:90%
of my own brain waves.

00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.222 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And I find great
hope in some of those.

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:12.824 align:middle line:84%
What-- you mentioned
earlier there's some

00:38:12.824 --> 00:38:13.658 align:middle line:90%
that work pretty well.

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:15.593 align:middle line:90%
Can you give us a-- an idea

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:18.029 align:middle line:84%
of some technologies you
found to be quite valid?

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:20.531 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, I mean
let's just take emotional

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:21.532 align:middle line:90%
freedom techniques.

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:22.600 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.068 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I mean they
are phenomenally good.

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:27.772 align:middle line:84%
They are based on-- there's
some good evidence for that

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:32.210 align:middle line:84%
and there's also fabulous
evidence for a tech--

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean huge body of
research for a thing called--

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it's EMDR
which is essentially

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.353 align:middle line:84%
when you've been traumatized,
if therapies work with you

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:43.721 align:middle line:90%
who knows how to do this

00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:47.392 align:middle line:84%
and will have you relive the
experience as he moves his hand

00:38:47.392 --> 00:38:49.594 align:middle line:84%
or she moves here
hand back and forth.

00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:54.198 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to remember
the trauma while you watch their

00:38:54.198 --> 00:38:55.566 align:middle line:90%
moving hand.

00:38:55.566 --> 00:39:01.239 align:middle line:84%
And there's something in the
brain that rewires essentially--

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.242 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- or tunes down
the emotional content

00:39:04.242 --> 00:39:08.613 align:middle line:84%
of that experience when you are
carrying out this, you know,

00:39:08.613 --> 00:39:12.183 align:middle line:84%
these two test at
ones like this.

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.351 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:15.319 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: So, it's a
fascinating idea and that's

00:39:15.319 --> 00:39:16.854 align:middle line:84%
where emotional freedom
techniques

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.356 align:middle line:90%
and thought filed therapy--

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.123 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:20.324 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: -- and those kinds

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:84%
of energy psychology
approaches really came from.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:28.433 align:middle line:84%
And there's just enormous
body of research around EMDR,

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:31.135 align:middle line:84%
but there's a growing body of
research about the other two.

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:33.771 align:middle line:84%
How brilliant they are
for trauma victims.

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:36.207 align:middle line:84%
They've used thought
field therapy.

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:40.545 align:middle line:84%
In places like Rowanda and
places where there is, you know,

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:44.248 align:middle line:84%
just mass genocide,
Kosovo and, you know,

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:49.120 align:middle line:84%
where people were amazingly,
you know, hugely traumatized,

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:52.957 align:middle line:84%
and have had something like
98 percent success rates.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:57.295 align:middle line:84%
I mean you just cannot get that
with any other kind of modality.

00:39:57.295 --> 00:40:00.865 align:middle line:84%
So, and this is something
completely without side effects.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:05.236 align:middle line:84%
So, I'm tremendously excited by
those things and their potential

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:14.312 align:middle line:84%
to help all kinds of emotional--
emotional basis of illness.

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.215 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, because
as you said that is--

00:40:17.215 --> 00:40:21.586 align:middle line:84%
it's all tied in this
very delicate interwoven--

00:40:21.586 --> 00:40:25.957 align:middle line:84%
this interwoven fields of ours
into the physical and as you say

00:40:25.957 --> 00:40:30.161 align:middle line:84%
if the emotional portion is
off, if you have stuck trauma

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:32.396 align:middle line:84%
in there, it's very hard
for the body to be able

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:35.099 align:middle line:84%
to free itself just for
the electrical circuitry

00:40:35.099 --> 00:40:38.636 align:middle line:84%
to even operate properly to
move the proper signals around.

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:41.839 align:middle line:84%
And all of these things you're
talking about do a beautiful job

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:44.742 align:middle line:84%
at that and it was five years
ago I interviewed a fellow named

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:45.810 align:middle line:90%
David Berceli.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.513 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing-- I
think it was called

00:40:48.513 --> 00:40:51.616 align:middle line:84%
"trauma release exercises,"
it's become a big deal

00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.150 align:middle line:90%
and been renamed since then.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:56.988 align:middle line:84%
That's another one
specifically dealing with PTST.

00:40:56.988 --> 00:41:00.391 align:middle line:84%
He did his studies initially
on soldiers returning,

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:03.261 align:middle line:84%
but everybody has some of
that stuck in there being

00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:06.497 align:middle line:84%
where you've had an
unpleasant shock of some kind

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:10.835 align:middle line:84%
that just kind of traps energy
in a certain area of the body

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:12.003 align:middle line:90%
or the matrix around it.

00:41:12.003 --> 00:41:13.938 align:middle line:90%
The etheric field or what not.

00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And that was again
another technique

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.975 align:middle line:90%
where you just release the flow

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:21.512 align:middle line:84%
of that trapped trauma
in the body.

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:24.148 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, yes, and I
think what's, you know,

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:29.520 align:middle line:84%
what's so interesting is,
you know, we in this kind

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.491 align:middle line:84%
of community who are interested
in natural things are--

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:35.860 align:middle line:84%
it's very easy to
get into the idea

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.396 align:middle line:90%
that if I just eat really well

00:41:38.396 --> 00:41:40.731 align:middle line:84%
and I take certain
vitamins, that's it.

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.999 align:middle line:90%
I will be healthy.

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:44.435 align:middle line:84%
And I was fascinated speaking
with the doctor who was

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:48.906 align:middle line:84%
in the Bay Area near San
Francisco who had this kind

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:53.311 align:middle line:84%
of very healthy living clientele
but she found that, you know,

00:41:53.311 --> 00:41:55.846 align:middle line:84%
about half of her
patients were so healthy

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:58.583 align:middle line:84%
and the other half
were sick as dogs.

00:41:58.583 --> 00:42:01.552 align:middle line:84%
No matter what they
took and what they ate.

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:04.322 align:middle line:84%
And she looked closer
into their lives

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:07.692 align:middle line:84%
and she found many
unfulfilled longings or--

00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:08.826 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:10.127 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- terrible
relationships or that kind

00:42:10.127 --> 00:42:13.831 align:middle line:84%
of trapped wrapped syndrome
in their jobs or whatever.

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:16.067 align:middle line:84%
But, something emotional
was array

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:19.237 align:middle line:84%
and that was probably more
important than anything

00:42:19.237 --> 00:42:21.572 align:middle line:90%
in making them or well--

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.274 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: The determining factor.

00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:26.177 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Is that-- there's that
study about cancer that it has

00:42:26.177 --> 00:42:29.814 align:middle line:84%
to do with-- when
people give up hope.

00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:31.415 align:middle line:84%
And then just go
on with their lives

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:33.584 align:middle line:84%
and suddenly they
start having reversals.

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:35.219 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yeah, yeah
they just say OK.

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.654 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Because the worry
is gone, the pressure--

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:38.756 align:middle line:84%
the mind isn't interfering
anymore.

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:41.692 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yeah, yeah they
just-- they just say, "OK,

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:44.362 align:middle line:84%
I've got cancer and now I better
go out and get the groceries

00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:46.430 align:middle line:90%
or whatever and that's it.

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.799 align:middle line:84%
Another thing that really
helps to and we cover

00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:52.103 align:middle line:84%
in the magazine is the
whole power of connection.

00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:53.504 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.606 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You know connection is
also possibly the best drug we

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:84%
could ever take, you know,
studies of the Japanese who are,

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.345 align:middle line:90%
you know, smoke like chimneys.

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:03.914 align:middle line:84%
Fine that they don't have
very much heart disease

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.983 align:middle line:90%
until they move to places like--

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:06.617 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:07.985 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: -- America.

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:12.823 align:middle line:84%
And then if they leave America--
American isolated lifestyle,

00:43:12.823 --> 00:43:14.925 align:middle line:90%
they then get heart disease

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:17.561 align:middle line:84%
that parallels the
rate in the states.

00:43:17.561 --> 00:43:18.829 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:21.999 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: But, those that
maintain close ties in America.

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:26.337 align:middle line:84%
If they do recreate that
kind of close communal tie.

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:30.408 align:middle line:84%
They don't get ill, no matter
what they eat whether it's tofu

00:43:30.408 --> 00:43:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and sushi or Big Mac and fries.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.077 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:33.911 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: You know.

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:35.413 align:middle line:90%
So, connection is another piece

00:43:35.413 --> 00:43:38.582 align:middle line:84%
of that puzzle that's really
important for good health.

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:40.651 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Just that whole
motion of peace and harmony

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:42.753 align:middle line:84%
and feeling loved and
part of something.

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:44.121 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:45.523 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That seems to me, that's
a number one line in defense

00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:46.991 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to immune systems.

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:50.494 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Absolutely, that being--
being part of something bigger.

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.629 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.064 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people
who are just, you know,

00:43:53.064 --> 00:43:55.866 align:middle line:84%
obsessively following the
next best thing in health

00:43:55.866 --> 00:43:57.835 align:middle line:84%
and I wish I've done
plenty of that myself.

00:43:57.835 --> 00:44:00.671 align:middle line:84%
I mean I'm curious and I've
been following the health trends

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.873 align:middle line:90%
for probably every 30 years now.

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:05.443 align:middle line:84%
And went, you know, out there
running before it was popular

00:44:05.443 --> 00:44:07.712 align:middle line:84%
to run as a little
girl and all that.

00:44:07.712 --> 00:44:10.581 align:middle line:84%
And yet-- and I am
relatively healthy,

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:12.016 align:middle line:90%
but I still see as you do.

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:16.487 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people that are doing
the same thing even more so,

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:20.491 align:middle line:84%
but I can't seem to find
that equilibrium at all.

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.659 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: No.

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:25.296 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's important
to be on vitamins--

00:44:25.296 --> 00:44:25.996 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:27.198 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: -- and beyond.

00:44:27.198 --> 00:44:28.899 align:middle line:84%
You know, are you living
the life you want to live?

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:29.667 align:middle line:90%
That is again--

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:30.501 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Huge.

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:31.469 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: -- huge.

00:44:31.469 --> 00:44:32.503 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.337 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you do
a really a good job

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:34.739 align:middle line:90%
of covering all of these areas.

00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:38.275 align:middle line:84%
I mean it really is a holistic
magazine in your approach

00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:41.812 align:middle line:84%
to what health is right down
to, you know, physiology

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:44.448 align:middle line:84%
and even exercising
in there, you know.

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:47.518 align:middle line:84%
The most effective little
short burst of for, you know,

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.720 align:middle line:84%
a big bang for your
buck, you know,

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.255 align:middle line:90%
even how to tighten your butt.

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.957 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] I mean here
you go into some

00:44:52.957 --> 00:44:55.025 align:middle line:84%
of the stuff you find another
women's magazines but--

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.160 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.528 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: -- it's a good
science, very efficient.

00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:01.031 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: What we try to do to
is we try to be contrarians--

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:02.399 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:03.934 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- about things to
even the tighten your butt,

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:06.570 align:middle line:84%
goes against a lot
of what people say

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:12.777 align:middle line:84%
or getting flat abs are exercise
guru that we have riding

00:45:12.777 --> 00:45:15.279 align:middle line:84%
in there talks about
that crunches are some

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:17.448 align:middle line:84%
of the worst things that
you can do for yourself

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:20.985 align:middle line:84%
because they will ruin
your posture, you know.

00:45:20.985 --> 00:45:23.954 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do crunches
do it over a Swiss ball.

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:26.457 align:middle line:84%
So, we try to look at, you
know, again we're looking

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:29.393 align:middle line:84%
at the standard stuff
people get on exercise--

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:30.494 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.729 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- and being
critical with that too.

00:45:31.729 --> 00:45:34.098 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Well, so what are
the best ab exercises

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.233 align:middle line:84%
if you're not suppose
to crunch it up.

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:40.471 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, doing them over
a Swiss ball is brilliant--

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:42.072 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, I-- that
is from the front

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:42.807 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Because-- yeah.

00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:43.908 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK

00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:44.442 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Because, you
know, being bent back--

00:45:44.442 --> 00:45:45.476 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:46.310 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: -- and then
coming over because

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:48.379 align:middle line:90%
that also aligns your posture.

00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:53.117 align:middle line:84%
And that's an interesting one
for women because a lot of women

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:57.087 align:middle line:84%
who think they don't like
their bust and they want

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.722 align:middle line:90%
to have breast implants.

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:03.928 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it says our exercise
guru has to do with bad posture.

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:07.598 align:middle line:84%
Not-- and if you correct that
posture you'll be, you know,

00:46:07.598 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
you get natural high
so to speak.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.234 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah, natural.

00:46:10.234 --> 00:46:11.035 align:middle line:90%
Well, that makes perfect sense.

00:46:11.035 --> 00:46:12.102 align:middle line:90%
You're developing a set

00:46:12.102 --> 00:46:14.071 align:middle line:84%
of muscles it's atrophied
more or less.

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:15.239 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:16.273 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: It's the foundation
for your bust line.

00:46:16.273 --> 00:46:17.641 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:19.076 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And other thing you--
I wrote about, because I read

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:21.178 align:middle line:84%
about in your magazine
just because it's one

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:24.148 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite topics says
you deal with the sun,

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:28.252 align:middle line:84%
talking about debunking the
doctors who debunk the value

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.987 align:middle line:90%
of sitting out in the sun.

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:32.156 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that
for a little bit.

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:35.893 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, there has been this
whole idea that the sun is bad

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:39.530 align:middle line:84%
for you essentially that you've
got this-- puts sun cream on,

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.932 align:middle line:84%
you've got to protect
yourself from the sun.

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:43.934 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't
recognize is

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:47.204 align:middle line:84%
that possibly the
most important vitamin

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:51.108 align:middle line:84%
and undervalued vitamin is
vitamin D. I mean it's not only

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:53.577 align:middle line:84%
great for your bones,
it's great for everything.

00:46:53.577 --> 00:46:57.481 align:middle line:84%
Any kind of illness you want
to mention often time comes

00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:00.951 align:middle line:84%
with the deficiency vitamin
D. So, we need vitamin D

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:03.454 align:middle line:84%
and we get it mostly
from the sun.

00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:05.155 align:middle line:90%
So, just think about this.

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:07.625 align:middle line:84%
If we're covering
ourselves up all the time

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:09.860 align:middle line:90%
with vitamin D we're-- you know,

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.863 align:middle line:84%
we are preventing
ourselves from getting that.

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:16.667 align:middle line:84%
We've also found there's a
really interesting connection

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:21.105 align:middle line:84%
between lack of vitamin D and
the development of diabetes.

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:24.675 align:middle line:84%
So, vitamin D is
really critical.

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:27.978 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
sun creams are being--

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:31.715 align:middle line:84%
remember, there are load
of chemicals and that mix

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:36.620 align:middle line:84%
of having the sun cream and
also using it when you're

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.790 align:middle line:84%
out in the sun seems to
also promote all kinds

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:43.394 align:middle line:84%
of problems possibly even
sun cancer-- skin cancer.

00:47:43.394 --> 00:47:44.995 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Skin cancer.

00:47:44.995 --> 00:47:47.965 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: So, the thing we're using
is prevention could be the thing

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:50.634 align:middle line:84%
that's actually causing
the problem.

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:51.969 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: And speaking

00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:54.738 align:middle line:84%
of prevention I was reading
a couple of little articles

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:57.608 align:middle line:84%
in there on the subject because
its summertime issues we're

00:47:57.608 --> 00:47:58.275 align:middle line:90%
looking at--

00:47:58.275 --> 00:47:58.976 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:47:58.976 --> 00:48:00.044 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: -- in sun care.

00:48:00.044 --> 00:48:03.480 align:middle line:84%
It was saying that
eating dark chocolate

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:09.019 align:middle line:84%
and even consuming coffee
somehow has a protective effect

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:11.956 align:middle line:84%
on the skin when it comes to
the sun, is that true or is

00:48:11.956 --> 00:48:13.424 align:middle line:84%
that just one of those
feel good things?

00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: No, I wish it were
just a feel good thing

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.261 align:middle line:90%
but no, it's true.

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:18.395 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Really?

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I mean there's--
it's really interesting,

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:23.701 align:middle line:84%
you can actually create
a lot of natural sun--

00:48:23.701 --> 00:48:27.538 align:middle line:84%
sun cream yourself and
sun protection yourself.

00:48:27.538 --> 00:48:32.076 align:middle line:84%
That isn't going to have the
bad affects of chemicals.

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:35.346 align:middle line:90%
One of those is the B vitamins.

00:48:35.346 --> 00:48:38.882 align:middle line:84%
B vitamins provide
much more protection,

00:48:38.882 --> 00:48:41.518 align:middle line:90%
chocolate seems to create more--

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.987 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Is it the flavonoids or--

00:48:42.987 --> 00:48:46.023 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yes, there's something
in the chocolate that seems

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:48.892 align:middle line:84%
to be protective, is though
you're wearing some sort

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:52.696 align:middle line:84%
of sun cream, it creates
more melanin in the skin

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:55.099 align:middle line:84%
and so creates a kind
of natural protection.

00:48:55.099 --> 00:48:57.501 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, so that
brings us to coco butter.

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:58.268 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.536 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Is coco butter one

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:00.571 align:middle line:84%
of those things it's somewhat
protection on the skin

00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:02.039 align:middle line:90%
or does it more fry you?

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:05.342 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I haven't seen any
research about it to be honest.

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:06.443 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, what about coffee?

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:08.178 align:middle line:90%
I mean how can coffee--

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.613 align:middle line:84%
I've never read those
two things before,

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:10.314 align:middle line:90%
so I find them interesting.

00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:11.382 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:49:11.382 --> 00:49:13.384 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, there's
something in coffee

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:16.754 align:middle line:84%
that again stimulates
the skin to prevent,

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:19.189 align:middle line:90%
you know, to prevent sun burn.

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:22.126 align:middle line:84%
And just allows you to be out
there a little bit longer.

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:25.963 align:middle line:84%
And so, I think the whole
idea is that we need some,

00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:28.332 align:middle line:90%
we need to be out unprotected

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:31.502 align:middle line:84%
for at least 10-15
minutes a day.

00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:34.738 align:middle line:84%
So, I think people have
to be really careful

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:37.574 align:middle line:84%
about not slathering to
much of the stuff on.

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:41.311 align:middle line:84%
Use these kinds of things like
chocolate whenever possible.

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:45.382 align:middle line:84%
And also use-- look at
natural sun screens,

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:49.119 align:middle line:84%
we cover in a current
issue coming up.

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Natural sun screens to use, so
that people can buy these stuff

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.159 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have the
worst of the chemicals.

00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:58.128 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yes, what about
[inaudible] kind of backing off

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:01.498 align:middle line:84%
from all these, stay out of the
sun, oh, herbs are dangerous

00:50:01.498 --> 00:50:04.968 align:middle line:84%
but our pharmaceuticals are OK
for you when we know better.

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:07.671 align:middle line:84%
What about-- I mean I don't
know if you go on to something

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:10.374 align:middle line:84%
as controversial as chemtrails,
that's dropping enough a lot

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:14.378 align:middle line:84%
of aluminum on the public
at large around the world.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.779 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:20.350 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Do you and all of these
see a larger picture in terms

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.120 align:middle line:84%
of the suppression
of all things natural

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:28.058 align:middle line:84%
to keep us feeling vital, alive
even connected with each other?

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:29.259 align:middle line:90%
Do you see--

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:31.295 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You mean some sort
of massive conspiracy.

00:50:31.295 --> 00:50:31.862 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:50:31.862 --> 00:50:33.197 align:middle line:90%
A larger one.

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:37.101 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I don't go there only
because I try to, you know,

00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:39.903 align:middle line:84%
that is an area that you
couldn't really prove.

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:43.307 align:middle line:84%
And I try to stay very grounded
in our publication with,

00:50:43.307 --> 00:50:44.341 align:middle line:90%
"Hey, here's the evidence."

00:50:44.341 --> 00:50:46.743 align:middle line:84%
And we even have the
medical references

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.846 align:middle line:84%
in a nice little
tidy box for anyone

00:50:48.846 --> 00:50:50.481 align:middle line:90%
who wants to look at that.

00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:53.283 align:middle line:84%
So, I don't go there,
but I do see it as part

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:58.188 align:middle line:84%
of a concerted economic
conspiracy in a sense.

00:50:58.188 --> 00:51:01.959 align:middle line:84%
I mean this is big money, we're
talking about big money is--

00:51:01.959 --> 00:51:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and the tube area is a big money
or big format and big food.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:10.300 align:middle line:84%
And big food is everything,
that's why we have GMO crops

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:16.640 align:middle line:84%
so that we can create more crops
to sell and using pesticides

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.042 align:middle line:84%
and fertilizers and all
of those kinds of links.

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:21.245 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Weakening the
plants, weakening the people.

00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:25.382 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Well, but again,
just staying away from that.

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.184 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, I'm saying
that's part of it.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.185 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:29.386 align:middle line:84%
But even if you don't
look at that,

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:31.822 align:middle line:84%
you can see a big enough
economic conspiracy

00:51:31.822 --> 00:51:33.290 align:middle line:90%
in the idea of that.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.659 align:middle line:84%
Look, it's all about
making money.

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:39.563 align:middle line:84%
And so, it's that short
sided approach of, you know,

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:41.698 align:middle line:84%
we're working just
for our stockholders,

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:45.068 align:middle line:84%
not for all the stakeholders
who eat our products, et cetera.

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:45.903 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:51:45.903 --> 00:51:47.304 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: And not for the planet.

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.573 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you're very clear on
where you want to go with it,

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:54.211 align:middle line:84%
and you're very clear on
giving signs backed information

00:51:54.211 --> 00:51:56.547 align:middle line:84%
or at least evidence
backed information

00:51:56.547 --> 00:51:58.582 align:middle line:84%
so people can make
their own decisions.

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:01.451 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen to be
more wired toward the notion

00:52:01.451 --> 00:52:03.787 align:middle line:84%
of larger conspiracies
as it were which I'd been

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.122 align:middle line:84%
in that world long
enough for I'm--

00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:06.623 align:middle line:84%
I kind of go there,
I mean if you--

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:07.758 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Sure.

00:52:07.758 --> 00:52:08.458 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: If you look at
the Bilderberg meetings

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.060 align:middle line:90%
for example each year,

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:13.363 align:middle line:84%
big format is always center
stage in the attendees.

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And they're-- they look
at long term agenda's

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.368 align:middle line:84%
that there planning
when they're together.

00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:21.471 align:middle line:84%
Economically and otherwise
so, the point is you--

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:23.874 align:middle line:84%
I don't think everybody
has to go there personally,

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:25.375 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to put
you on the spot.

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:26.610 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Sure.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.078 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: The point is, you're
putting the information

00:52:28.078 --> 00:52:30.147 align:middle line:84%
out that would indicate,
if you're going to go

00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:32.883 align:middle line:84%
that way what actually
is going on.

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:34.751 align:middle line:84%
And so I appreciate
that diligence.

00:52:34.751 --> 00:52:37.754 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: We just want to
provide the proof and we try

00:52:37.754 --> 00:52:40.657 align:middle line:84%
to provide things
that are unassailable.

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:41.892 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.427 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And we found even
when the medical literature,

00:52:43.427 --> 00:52:47.064 align:middle line:84%
you know, when the medical
publications have tried to write

00:52:47.064 --> 00:52:49.466 align:middle line:84%
about us, they're really
scratching around trying

00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:53.003 align:middle line:84%
to attack us via our advertisers
or something like that,

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you know, or trying to
find anything they can.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.711 align:middle line:84%
But we try to make them air
tight full of medical research

00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:02.980 align:middle line:90%
but done in a very readable way.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:04.114 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:04.881 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: So, the people
can take what they need

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:06.283 align:middle line:90%
to take from these.

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:07.417 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Well, in you're--

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:10.120 align:middle line:84%
a good solid old fashion
journalist I mean you--

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.856 align:middle line:84%
you cover your basis
and you do the research,

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:15.993 align:middle line:84%
there's so many blogs
and sites out there some

00:53:15.993 --> 00:53:17.194 align:middle line:90%
of which are wonderful,

00:53:17.194 --> 00:53:19.229 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's some
I look at regularly.

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:23.600 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them not so much,
the diligence hasn't been done

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.236 align:middle line:84%
to really look at the
signs one way or the other.

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:29.006 align:middle line:84%
And so, I have a great
deal of respect that you go

00:53:29.006 --> 00:53:32.676 align:middle line:84%
to that link enough that these
other forces actually want

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:36.246 align:middle line:84%
to attack you, that only gives
more credence in my mind.

00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:39.182 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yeah, I mean I think
what's really important is to be

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:41.685 align:middle line:84%
if you are going to put
your self in that position

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:45.689 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to attack,
you know, I always say

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.591 align:middle line:84%
that if you're going to
be completely outrageous

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:51.128 align:middle line:84%
and radical you have to do it
with a very conservative cover.

00:53:51.128 --> 00:53:52.195 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:53.597 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And so, that's
what we try to do.

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:54.831 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Yeah, we'll take a-- it
looks like a women's magazine.

00:53:54.831 --> 00:53:55.933 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:53:55.933 --> 00:53:57.134 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: There's a lot
more than that to it--

00:53:57.134 --> 00:53:58.335 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:53:58.335 --> 00:53:59.903 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What about yourself,
now you have spent--

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:03.273 align:middle line:84%
what did you say about 25 years
examining all these things

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.574 align:middle line:90%
because of health issues you had

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:06.310 align:middle line:84%
when you were younger
and so forth.

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.279 align:middle line:90%
What have you come to utilize

00:54:09.279 --> 00:54:13.083 align:middle line:84%
and find great value
in for yourself?

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:16.486 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I use pick and mix
on alternative medicine.

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:19.489 align:middle line:84%
First of all my children have
grown up with homeopathy,

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.892 align:middle line:84%
they have kits if they
go off on something,

00:54:21.892 --> 00:54:26.797 align:middle line:84%
they take homeopathic kits with
them, and we have the ability

00:54:26.797 --> 00:54:30.100 align:middle line:84%
to just call up homeopathic
hot lines in the UK.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.070 align:middle line:84%
If there's a problem, if one
of my daughter's has a flu

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:36.473 align:middle line:84%
or something, I can call up
and find out what to give her.

00:54:36.473 --> 00:54:40.077 align:middle line:84%
And I use that, I use
a lot of acupuncture.

00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:43.780 align:middle line:84%
My husband is more
of a herbalist guy.

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:48.418 align:middle line:84%
So, he gets herbal medicine and
that works really well for him.

00:54:48.418 --> 00:54:53.623 align:middle line:84%
I've like some of the emotional
freedom technique type things.

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:56.426 align:middle line:84%
It just really depends
obviously functional medicine

00:54:56.426 --> 00:55:01.865 align:middle line:84%
where big vitamin takers in our
house, we have an organic house.

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:05.769 align:middle line:84%
I go to a farmers market
and buy fresh organic leaves

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:08.171 align:middle line:84%
for everyone, you
know, over the weekends

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:11.375 align:middle line:84%
and just make sure
everything is home cooked

00:55:11.375 --> 00:55:14.411 align:middle line:90%
and fresh every single day.

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:15.812 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Good for you.

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:20.283 align:middle line:84%
[laughs] I try to do basically
the same, and get pretty close,

00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:22.219 align:middle line:90%
maybe not quite as diligence.

00:55:22.219 --> 00:55:23.053 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah.

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:23.653 align:middle line:90%
But I mean, I'm not a purest.

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:24.755 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:25.822 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I like going
out for meal, you know,

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:28.191 align:middle line:84%
like anybody having
a glass of wine.

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:31.228 align:middle line:84%
But I just try to make
sure that it's, you know,

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:34.998 align:middle line:84%
that the food is not processed
during some way interfered

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.366 align:middle line:90%
with basically.

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:39.669 align:middle line:84%
And try to make sure that
there's a healthy plate,

00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:41.805 align:middle line:84%
you know, in front of
everybody everyday.

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:43.907 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What about the
subject of animal protein,

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:46.042 align:middle line:84%
because I obviously we're
looking at two different issue,

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:48.044 align:middle line:84%
some people say,
"The time has past,

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:49.780 align:middle line:84%
humans don't need
animal protein."

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.815 align:middle line:84%
Other people say, "Uh,
I'm sick without it,

00:55:51.815 --> 00:55:53.650 align:middle line:84%
you know I just feel
like I'm dying."

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:55.585 align:middle line:84%
And we are looking
at quality issues

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.187 align:middle line:90%
and drugging issues and so fort.

00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:01.458 align:middle line:84%
How is your magazine approach
the subject of animal proteins?

00:56:01.458 --> 00:56:04.494 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: OK, well, I approach
it through some of the work

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:08.799 align:middle line:84%
of guy called William
Wolcott who was a disciple

00:56:08.799 --> 00:56:11.802 align:middle line:84%
of a guy called William Kelley
who was a cancer pioneer.

00:56:11.802 --> 00:56:12.602 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: All right yes, good work.

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.104 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: And he found-- yeah,

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:17.274 align:middle line:84%
he found that essentially
one man's meat is another

00:56:17.274 --> 00:56:18.275 align:middle line:90%
man's poison.

00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:19.476 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:22.479 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: If some people are
parasympathetic dominant

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:25.248 align:middle line:84%
with their bodies and other
people are sympathetic dominant,

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:30.554 align:middle line:84%
and what that comes down to,
is that food of one variety

00:56:30.554 --> 00:56:32.656 align:middle line:84%
or another or a carbohydrate
for instance.

00:56:32.656 --> 00:56:35.892 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a completely
opposite effect on someone

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:38.595 align:middle line:84%
who has the other thing,
the other dominants.

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:42.499 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And so, he found some
people essentially need more

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:45.402 align:middle line:84%
carbs than others, some people
need more protein than others,

00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:47.003 align:middle line:90%
some people need more meat,

00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.706 align:middle line:84%
and some people need
just vegetarian.

00:56:49.706 --> 00:56:53.243 align:middle line:84%
So, I think it's-- you know,
we're biochemically individual.

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:56.913 align:middle line:84%
So, well, I am very sympathetic
to the whole vegetarian idea,

00:56:56.913 --> 00:57:00.016 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very much against
in our magazine is very much

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:03.253 align:middle line:84%
against any kind of
mass produced farming.

00:57:03.253 --> 00:57:05.889 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, and
battering hands

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:09.159 align:middle line:84%
and battery farming
et cetera and the kind

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:11.628 align:middle line:90%
of meat markets that they have.

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:15.932 align:middle line:84%
Some people need meat and
so I think that, you know,

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:20.904 align:middle line:84%
we as [inaudible] organic
meat, and for people to look

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:24.875 align:middle line:84%
at their-- this is sort
of beyond blood type,

00:57:24.875 --> 00:57:26.877 align:middle line:84%
its look at their
metabolic type.

00:57:26.877 --> 00:57:30.447 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: That's where Kelley's
work really was, was that--

00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:32.182 align:middle line:90%
oxidization versus slow.

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:32.849 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:33.416 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Oxidization--

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:34.751 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Exactly.

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:36.653 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Most people fall in
more one group than the other--

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:38.021 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Exactly.

00:57:38.021 --> 00:57:40.257 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And if you're trying to
leave it out via philosophy,

00:57:40.257 --> 00:57:43.393 align:middle line:84%
leave one out that's
not your oxidation type

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:45.962 align:middle line:90%
that can be real trouble.

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:49.065 align:middle line:84%
I mean and that's where
this whole thing about meats

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:51.768 align:middle line:84%
and animal proteins have
come up again so many people

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:53.803 align:middle line:84%
like self vegetarian
in 20 years.

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:57.607 align:middle line:84%
You start seeing that there's
a breakdown that can occur

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:59.643 align:middle line:84%
and the same thing the other
way, you're eating meats

00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:02.846 align:middle line:84%
when your body wants more
complex carbohydrates.

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:04.881 align:middle line:84%
But it's a touchy subject
for a lot of people

00:58:04.881 --> 00:58:06.983 align:middle line:84%
and that's also become
big business.

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:10.854 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Absolutely and I think
that its important to find out,

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:14.057 align:middle line:84%
you know, your generic
type, your bio-chemical type

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:16.960 align:middle line:84%
but mainly your bio-chemical
type, your metabolic type,

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.030 align:middle line:84%
and then do what
makes you feel best,

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:22.065 align:middle line:84%
but eat the healthiest
food you can.

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:22.866 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes, absolutely.

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:23.667 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: And don't over do it.

00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:24.768 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: No matter which one.

00:58:24.768 --> 00:58:26.136 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Yeah, and don't
over do it on meat,

00:58:26.136 --> 00:58:29.706 align:middle line:84%
I mean we've had too many--
and don't over do it on carbs.

00:58:29.706 --> 00:58:30.974 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Right.

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:32.208 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: You know, I mean
that's the other problem too.

00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:34.077 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: What happen with that
food pyramid in America,

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:37.948 align:middle line:84%
I think we picked up like 15
percent body fat and mass.

00:58:37.948 --> 00:58:40.517 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Oh yes, absolutely.

00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:41.618 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yeah.

00:58:41.618 --> 00:58:42.886 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And, you know,
that whole emphasis

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:46.690 align:middle line:84%
on carbs being the best
thing to do was really--

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:50.794 align:middle line:84%
now, that was very much big
food backed, because of course,

00:58:50.794 --> 00:58:53.597 align:middle line:84%
do you know cabs its all
processed stuff, yeah.

00:58:53.597 --> 00:58:55.332 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Highly profitable
for them.

00:58:55.332 --> 00:58:57.067 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah, exactly.

00:58:57.067 --> 00:59:00.236 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: We're going to have a
second conversation its going

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:03.640 align:middle line:84%
to really explore another
great controversial issue.

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.177 align:middle line:84%
So, we'll take a little break
and then we'll come back

00:59:07.177 --> 00:59:10.013 align:middle line:84%
and continue our conversation,
but than you for that.

00:59:10.013 --> 00:59:12.983 align:middle line:84%
And, hey, just before we
go we have just the second,

00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:15.185 align:middle line:84%
any of the typologies,
are there some self test

00:59:15.185 --> 00:59:17.988 align:middle line:84%
that you recognize or you-- that
you would recommend for people

00:59:17.988 --> 00:59:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that want to do their
own typology.

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: I love William
Wolcott's healthexcel.com.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.228 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK.

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:28.498 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Because he has simple
metabolic typing test you can

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:32.268 align:middle line:84%
take, very inexpensive,
you can dot that.

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:35.605 align:middle line:84%
I like for those people who can
afford it the kinds of test,

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:39.509 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that-- parasite
test are really important.

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:41.911 align:middle line:84%
Looking at leaky gut
is really important.

00:59:41.911 --> 00:59:43.313 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:46.416 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Looking at your vitamin
mineral profile is important,

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:49.119 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, particularly
as people age, you know,

00:59:49.119 --> 00:59:51.254 align:middle line:84%
they get to be more
and more deficient

00:59:51.254 --> 00:59:53.023 align:middle line:90%
in things like chromium.

00:59:53.023 --> 00:59:54.357 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: Yes.

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:55.859 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: And, you know, when
things like magnesium and zinc,

00:59:55.859 --> 00:59:57.994 align:middle line:90%
everybody is deficient in zinc.

00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:02.298 align:middle line:84%
So, finding out rather that
just, you know, a scatter going

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:06.069 align:middle line:84%
to approach, it's really
great if you can to get tested

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.203 align:middle line:90%
and find out what you need

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.905 align:middle line:84%
and to create a program
good for you.

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:11.041 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Excellent,
healthexcel.com

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.142 align:middle line:90%
for you metabolic type.

01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:13.343 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yes.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.678 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: And you want to
get back in parasite test

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:16.479 align:middle line:90%
and what was the last one?

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.581 align:middle line:84%
>> LM: Just to have a
good vitamin mineral test.

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:20.083 align:middle line:84%
>> RM: Oh, vitamin mineral
test, OK, great, good.

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.051 align:middle line:90%
>> LM: Yeah, see where you are.

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:23.653 align:middle line:90%
>> RM: OK, thank you so much.

01:00:23.653 --> 01:00:25.121 align:middle line:90%
In our nest conversation Lynne

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.856 align:middle line:84%
and I will be discussing
the assumption

01:00:26.856 --> 01:00:29.259 align:middle line:84%
that marker genes will
manifest into disease.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:31.928 align:middle line:84%
In other words, was it
wise for Angelina Jolie

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:35.298 align:middle line:84%
to have her breast removed over
fear from a genetic read out?

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.802 align:middle line:84%
Again, you can find Lynne's new
