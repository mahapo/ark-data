00:00:34.294 --> 00:00:36.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: Something
has gone terribly wrong with

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
the way in which our children's
bodies are developing.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:10%
One-third of all our kids
now suffer collectively

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.420 align:middle line:10%
from allergies, autism,
ADHD, and asthma,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.270 align:middle line:10%
according to the book,
"Unhealthy Truth",

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.670 align:middle line:10%
by Robyn O'Brien.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:10%
As a successful businesswoman
in the financial sector,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:10%
Robyn watched helpless as her
baby's face swelled and turned

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.680 align:middle line:10%
red, having no idea what
was happening to her.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Today, she speaks to
parents all over the world

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
through her website,
Allergy Kids,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.190 align:middle line:84%
as a warrior for
education on why

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:90%
our kids are sicker than ever.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.850 align:middle line:10%
You are a warrioress, and
I'm so happy to have you

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.150 align:middle line:10%
with us here today.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.150 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of people will
be looking in hindsight.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my child's long-grown,
and of childbearing age himself

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
now, or, well, child-rearing
age, shall we say.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.590 align:middle line:84%
But most people in that
day then, and decades past,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:84%
had no idea what was wrong when
these little kids developed

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
these symptoms, and
you've been through it.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.950 align:middle line:84%
You've been through some really
tough stuff with your kids.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:10%
Let's talk about who
you were, and why

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.450 align:middle line:10%
this happened in your life.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.520 align:middle line:10%
Because you're an unlikely
hero in this area, really.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
>> ROBYN O'BRIEN: I mean, I was
not looking for it, you know?

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:10%
I was the oldest of
four kids and had

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.950 align:middle line:10%
had these four little kids,
kind of, boom, boom, boom.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.900 align:middle line:10%
And really expected
everything to keep

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:10%
on rolling along
as it always had.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.400 align:middle line:10%
My older three were fine.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I had not given much
thought to anything

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:84%
like food allergies, or asthma,
or any of these conditions

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
that are now impacting
so many of the kids.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And then when our fourth child
was a baby about seven years

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.720 align:middle line:84%
ago, she just had this allergic
reaction over breakfast.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And the breakfast that
morning was just what

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.120 align:middle line:90%
I've trusted to feed my kids.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.220 align:middle line:84%
They were brands that
I had grown up eating.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.294 align:middle line:84%
They were brands that
friends and family had eaten.

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:90%
Didn't think anything of it.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It was waffles, and
tubes of blue yogurt,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.100 align:middle line:90%
and some scrambled eggs.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Tubes of blue yogurt.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.116 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: It was
tubes of blue yogurt.

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Low-key there.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And
you know, I just--

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I laughed when
I read that in your book.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, you know,
I mean you figure that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.882 align:middle line:84%
if it's on the grocery
store shelf, it's fine.

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's done the homework.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, right.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And so as her face
started swelling shut that

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.100 align:middle line:90%
morning, I was so clueless.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:90%
I was so completely clueless.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
What in the world is
happening to this child?

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.354 align:middle line:84%
I looked at the older
three and I thought maybe

00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
they had put
something in her face

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:90%
when I'd had my back turned--

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.881 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: --fixing breakfast.

00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And they just gave me those
blank little kid stares.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.180 align:middle line:90%
They just stood there.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was when my heart
just started to race.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, what is
happening to my child?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And I raced her to the doctor
and the doctor's saying, well,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Robyn, there are these
top eight allergens today,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.900 align:middle line:84%
and children are
increasingly allergic.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, since when?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't
know anybody that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.090 align:middle line:84%
had had these food
allergies as a kid.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.950 align:middle line:84%
PB & J, or a carton of milk,
those weren't loaded weapons.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You mean
when you were a kid?

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.910 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Yeah,
when I was a kid.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And back in those days,
there wasn't the kind

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.210 align:middle line:84%
of allergic reaction
to all of this, which

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
we'll talk about
in a little bit.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is really
a new phenomenon.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.988 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: It was new.

00:03:28.988 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm standing
there thinking,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to deal with
this, and what in the world

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.220 align:middle line:84%
is this child going
to eat, you know?

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So that moment where
your ability to parent

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
is just completely challenged,
and it was a terrifying moment.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:84%
But we got her calmed down, and
everything was under control,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.490 align:middle line:90%
and we got the kids home.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And truly, at that
point, I really

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:84%
wanted to try to understand
what was happening.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to understand what
was happening to these kids.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And as I really started into
the research, and at that point,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
it was just what
is a food allergy,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.737 align:middle line:84%
and why are so
many kids allergic?

00:04:02.737 --> 00:04:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we launch into that,
just take a couple of minutes

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.520 align:middle line:84%
to let people know more about
who you were at that time.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520 align:middle line:90%
What your life was like.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
It was a very
different kind of life

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:90%
than what you're doing now.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: Oh, yeah.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.455 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: High-powered
financial sector stuff, so.

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Yeah, you know,
I grew up in Houston, Texas,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
and I had gone to business
school on full scholarship.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I had graduated
the top my class.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.580 align:middle line:84%
I was recruited by
companies like Enron.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:84%
You know, I went full steam
into the financial world.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.220 align:middle line:90%
It was my passion.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We had an amazing
team of seven guys,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.850 align:middle line:84%
and we covered a whole
bunch of industries.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.549 align:middle line:84%
And being the only
woman on the team,

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:84%
they said, you're going to cover
the food industry, you know?

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I mean,
I didn't know how to cook.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.825 align:middle line:90%
I burnt noodles.

00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you bought
little tubes of blue yogurt.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: I mean, I was
really, so I thought, OK,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:90%
this is just crunching numbers.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:84%
This is meeting
management teams.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.460 align:middle line:90%
I can do it.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.280 align:middle line:84%
May not be the industry I would
have chosen, but I can do it.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And so we met with the
management teams from everyone

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:84%
from Walmart, to Costco, to
Kroger, Safeway, Whole Foods.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.130 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, the Whole Foods
and Wild Oats, at the time,

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.489 align:middle line:84%
those management teams
would come into our offices,

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:84%
and they would order these
veggie subs, you know.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And we were down in
Texas, and we would just

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:84%
dismiss it, really, as this
kind of marketing niche

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.640 align:middle line:90%
that they had carved out.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, that
had been my background.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's analyze the numbers.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.070 align:middle line:84%
Let's figure out the best way
to maximize shareholder return.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.435 align:middle line:84%
And in hindsight, you know,
now I look back on that.

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, thank
goodness the guys

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.120 align:middle line:90%
made me cover the food industry.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
But as we moved to Colorado
and I traded the diaper bag

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
for a brief-- I mean, traded
the briefcase for a diaper bag,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I always thought I would
go back into finance.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely loved it.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.480 align:middle line:84%
And that had always
been my intention,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.521 align:middle line:84%
that once the kids were
up and running in school,

00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
that I would go back
into the finance world.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And so that morning,
little did I

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
know that my whole
life was gonna change.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I had
planned, everything

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.940 align:middle line:84%
that I thought I
knew, and everything

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.220 align:middle line:84%
that I had mapped out just
suddenly took this huge detour.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.350 align:middle line:84%
OK, so because we can tell
what your personality's like,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:84%
obviously, you're
someone who is going

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.750 align:middle line:84%
to-- you're going to
strive to be the best

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
and know the most you possibly
can at whatever you take on.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And now you were a ferocious
mother on top of it.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.939 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well,
you know, exactly.

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So you know, here I
was, and I had always

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:84%
been the first born
of four children,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and inherited all
those type A genes,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
and I had thrown that into
everything I'd never done,

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.250 align:middle line:84%
whether it was sports
in school or academics.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, I'm sitting
there feeling completely

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
incompetent, completely
illiterate, and I thought,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:84%
I have got to school
myself on this

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
and began just this massive
education, you know?

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.315 align:middle line:84%
And it was as simple as,
what is a food allergy?

00:06:52.315 --> 00:06:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't even know
what a food allergy was.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
All I was being told was
that it could kill a child,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and that it had this varying
range, and you didn't know,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:90%
there was no predictability.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought, this
is absolutely terrifying.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And so I began that morning with
learning that a food allergy is

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.600 align:middle line:84%
when your body sees
food as foreign

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.170 align:middle line:84%
and it just launches
this response

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
to drive out that
foreign invader.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.260 align:middle line:90%
So in some cases it's mild.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.440 align:middle line:84%
It's runny nose or watery
eyes, and in some cases,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
it can be this life-threatening
allergic reaction where things

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
start to swell shut, and your
body starts to shut down.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.044 align:middle line:84%
And there was really
no way of knowing

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:27.210 align:middle line:84%
one way or the other which
was going to happen next,

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and that unpredictability, to
me, was absolutely terrifying.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And so as I began looking
at the data, thinking again,

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know anyone had a food
allergy when we were children,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.730 align:middle line:84%
and yet, now,
there are a growing

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
number of American
children that were

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.872 align:middle line:90%
increasingly allergic to food.

00:07:44.872 --> 00:07:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at
the data that morning,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
I learned that, from
1997 until 2002,

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.860 align:middle line:84%
there had been a doubling
of the peanut allergy.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is in
a five-year span.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.034 align:middle line:84%
That is a shocking statistic
to me as a number cruncher.

00:07:56.034 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, it is.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.991 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And I'm, like,
that's not something--

00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:00.670 align:middle line:84%
your genetics don't
change that quickly.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.740 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: There's something
in the environment--

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Something's
been injected into.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.594 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --that changed.

00:08:04.594 --> 00:08:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And as I began looking at the
data, at that point in time,

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.260 align:middle line:84%
seven years ago, one out of
17 kids under the age of three

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.070 align:middle line:90%
had a food allergy.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Today that number,
only seven years later,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.730 align:middle line:90%
is now one out of 13.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And you walk in any
preschool and you

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:84%
know these numbers to be true
because of the EpiPens that

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.350 align:middle line:84%
have to be stocked
on those shelves.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.915 align:middle line:84%
So as I continued
to do the research,

00:08:24.915 --> 00:08:27.290 align:middle line:84%
I was learning things
later on about how

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.040 align:middle line:84%
the Centers for Disease Control
was seeing an escalating

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.400 align:middle line:84%
rate in the
hospitalizations related

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:90%
to food allergic reactions.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So on the one hand,
the idea was still

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.270 align:middle line:84%
being presented in the media
seven years ago as sort

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.950 align:middle line:84%
of maybe these were moms
just clamoring for attention,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
or self-diagnosing, or claiming
that their children had

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.870 align:middle line:90%
these issues.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.736 align:middle line:84%
But then the CDC
started to come through

00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:51.236 align:middle line:84%
with this hard data
saying, you know

00:08:51.236 --> 00:08:53.635 align:middle line:84%
what, these are
hospitalizations related

00:08:53.635 --> 00:08:54.760 align:middle line:90%
to food allergic reactions.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.320 align:middle line:84%
A 265% increase where
doctors are checking people

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:90%
into the ER because of this.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.040 align:middle line:84%
It was just like what I had
been through with my daughter.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.998 align:middle line:84%
And so as I started
looking at that data again,

00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
it was just like,
what has changed?

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:90%
What has changed?

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So when you started
your journey to educate

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.915 align:middle line:84%
yourself, were you going
to official sources,

00:09:12.915 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
kind of, mainstream
sources, initially, or--?

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: Initially, I was.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like, again,
I had this background

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:90%
in business and finance.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.861 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I had found this
passion, I mean, as any mother,

00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:26.360 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
health of your child.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.693 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is absolutely
your first and foremost duty.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a
sudden, I was thinking,

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.610 align:middle line:84%
how can I leverage this
skill set, what I am,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:84%
this background,
into helping advance

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:84%
this space for the
health of my children.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And so you know, I was reaching
out to different groups,

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.956 align:middle line:84%
and I wasn't getting
exactly a warm response.

00:09:44.956 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that really bothered me

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
was that, at the time, in
the food allergy space,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.720 align:middle line:84%
if you wanted to know
more about food allergies,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:84%
it was a membership
subscription-based model,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.210 align:middle line:90%
and you had to pay money.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at that and I
thought, if my child had just

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000 align:middle line:84%
been diagnosed with
diabetes, I wouldn't

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
be having to pay money
to learn about diabetes.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
Why am I being asked to pay
money on food allergy research?

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt that
there was an opportunity

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.570 align:middle line:84%
to launch a really simple
website at the time that just

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.320 align:middle line:84%
gave parents not only the
information they needed,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.950 align:middle line:84%
the basic information,
but I also

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.200 align:middle line:84%
could see that there was a
real need for a community,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, that this was
something that none of us

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.560 align:middle line:84%
had chosen, and it sort
of imposed these hardships

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.200 align:middle line:84%
and restrictions, and
you felt quite isolated.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Communities, and schools,
and family members,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.480 align:middle line:84%
even, weren't quite ready to
accept the enormity of what

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.980 align:middle line:84%
the condition was until we
really needed each other.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.280 align:middle line:10%
And so we started Allergy Kids
just with that goal in mind.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, at the time,
if I can help raise awareness,

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.940 align:middle line:10%
maybe help raise money for
these larger organizations,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.929 align:middle line:10%
these nonprofits in
the space, that's

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:10%
what we were going to do.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Well, and you did.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you said, it was not
necessarily a warm welcome.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
F-A-N-N, just for starters.

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about your experience
with who the group is,

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
what you tried to do, and
what the reaction was.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.645 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: So you know,
I started with this little

00:11:04.645 --> 00:11:07.186 align:middle line:84%
symbol, and I thought, you know,
we're just going to use this

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:09.780 align:middle line:84%
little sticker like the Mr.
Yuck sticker I'd had as a kid.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to create a little
sticker or symbol that

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.340 align:middle line:84%
could just be used in a
lunchroom to sort of help

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.430 align:middle line:84%
identify where
these kids might be.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And CNN loved it, and
they contacted me.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.390 align:middle line:84%
We launched Allergy Kids'
site on Mother's Day,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.510 align:middle line:84%
and they contacted
me a few weeks later,

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.090 align:middle line:84%
and the weekend of
Father's Day, I was on CNN.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:90%
And I was really--

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How did you get
yourself out there so quickly?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.290 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: I really
think it was just--

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Just an idea
whose time had come.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.693 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --time
had come, you know?

00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was passionate, and
I could articulate it.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.210 align:middle line:90%
And so CNN, they had me on.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.070 align:middle line:84%
I had never done any major
interview at that point,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.570 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm in a dark room, staring
straight into this camera.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And thankfully, the
interviewer was really kind.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.070 align:middle line:90%
She really got it, you know?

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:90%
She wasn't dismissive at all.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:84%
She said, this is a real
problem, we've got these kids,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.250 align:middle line:84%
and this mom has
proposed a solution.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And it just went around
the food allergy world.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, interestingly, there was a
nonprofit that was based in DC,

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and it's like they had an
allergic reaction to me.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was like, it
didn't go through them,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.907 align:middle line:84%
and so they were not
comfortable with that it had not

00:12:12.907 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:84%
gone through them,
that suddenly there

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.550 align:middle line:84%
was another organization that
was out there in the press,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.530 align:middle line:84%
bringing attention
to this issue.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I
thought, I must have somehow

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:23.724 align:middle line:90%
misconveyed myself.

00:12:23.724 --> 00:12:25.390 align:middle line:10%
Surely they need to
know that, like, I'm

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.220 align:middle line:10%
trying to raise money
and raise awareness

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.174 align:middle line:10%
for this organization
and this effort.

00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:30.590 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: For
their organization.

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:10%
>> O'BRIEN: Exactly.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.620 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.255 align:middle line:10%
>> O'BRIEN: And so,
you know, again,

00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:10%
it was just this push
back, and this push back.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.040 align:middle line:84%
And after probably
two or three times,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.490 align:middle line:84%
including some pretty
negative emails that got

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.990 align:middle line:84%
blasted out to, kind of,
this food allergy space

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.790 align:middle line:84%
about the work that
I was doing, again,

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.400 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, this
makes absolutely no sense.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:90%
This makes no sense.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm a mother of
four, trying to fight

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.740 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
health of these kids.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:54.660 align:middle line:90%
This makes no sense.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And so as I began,
at first I thought

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I must have done
something wrong to,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.170 align:middle line:90%
sort of, irk them this badly.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:10%
And yet, as I started to share
my story with other moms who

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.234 align:middle line:10%
had websites, they
said, oh, my gosh.

00:13:09.234 --> 00:13:11.650 align:middle line:10%
You know, there was something
similar that happened to me.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.630 align:middle line:10%
And the more I started
to ask, the more I

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:10%
realized there were
other people who

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:10%
had tried to either gain
some kind of momentum,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.140 align:middle line:10%
gain some kind of
presence, and they

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.832 align:middle line:10%
had felt the same
kind of push back.

00:13:22.832 --> 00:13:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, this
just doesn't make sense.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.706 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about who that group is.

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:28.350 align:middle line:90%
Who is F-A-N-N, FANN?

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.350 align:middle line:10%
>> O'BRIEN: At the time,
it was the Food Allergy

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.962 align:middle line:10%
and Anaphylactic Network, and
it was started by a mother whose

00:13:32.962 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:10%
child had had an
allergic reaction.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.840 align:middle line:84%
It was so sincerely
motivated in the beginning.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.650 align:middle line:10%
But, you know, as we
see today, I mean,

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:10%
there's all kinds of
influence from pressures

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:10%
that can come into any group
or organization, nonprofit

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:10%
or for-profit.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think what
started to happen

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:84%
was that that nonprofit,
in 1998, Kraft

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.880 align:middle line:84%
became the sole sponsor
of their website.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.455 align:middle line:84%
And you know, again, when I
read that, I mean, I had Kraft

00:13:58.455 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
all through my
kitchen cupboards,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:00.775 align:middle line:84%
so I didn't really
think anything of it.

00:14:00.775 --> 00:14:01.075 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mac and cheese.

00:14:01.075 --> 00:14:01.575 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:14:01.575 --> 00:14:03.410 align:middle line:10%
>> O'BRIEN: I didn't
think anything of it.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:10%
But then I thought, you know,
sole sponsor of the website.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.300 align:middle line:10%
And the more I started to
learn about the changes

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.250 align:middle line:10%
to the food supply,
the more I realized,

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.580 align:middle line:10%
this isn't on that
website, you know?

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.812 align:middle line:84%
And as the push back grew
more and more intense,

00:14:15.812 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:84%
they ended up
sending a letter out.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of a legal letter,
and I took it to my attorney.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.732 align:middle line:84%
And he just said,
this is just meant

00:14:24.732 --> 00:14:26.190 align:middle line:84%
to intimidate you,
Robyn, you know?

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I don't
see what I have done wrong.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
And he pulled together
a legal response

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and fired it right back, and
we didn't hear from them again.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:84%
But at that point, because
they had been so threatened

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:43.370 align:middle line:84%
by the work, I thought, what
is it about this organization

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
that they're trying to
control this message so

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
tightly that they would
be willing to fire

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
legal letters at a mother of
four who's literally working

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.371 align:middle line:84%
to protect the
health of children?

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And so at that point,
you know, I thought,

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to pull
their financial statements

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.066 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I did, that
was this background of mine,

00:14:58.066 --> 00:14:58.400 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.346 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Following the money.

00:14:59.346 --> 00:14:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: So I just thought,
I'm going to pull the financial

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:90%
statements.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.934 align:middle line:84%
I'd seen that Kraft was
the sponsor of the website,

00:15:04.934 --> 00:15:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and that's when the story
started to fall out.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize there
were these big food companies,

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:14.052 align:middle line:84%
and these big chemical companies
were funding the organization.

00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:16.260 align:middle line:84%
The doctors that were on
the medical board, you know,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
were working very closely with
some of these corporations.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, well,
technically there's

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.450 align:middle line:90%
nothing wrong with this.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not disclosed
on their website.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, if these are the
relationships that they have,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.949 align:middle line:84%
they're probably not
going to be the first ones

00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:84%
to start talking about
some of these issues

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that I was starting to
see with the food supply.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.340 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, it
really motivated

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.090 align:middle line:84%
me to say, Allergy Kids, again,
has a very unique position,

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.062 align:middle line:84%
and a very unique
role to fill here--

00:15:42.062 --> 00:15:42.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.769 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --to begin
to really educate people.

00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:48.015 align:middle line:84%
Not just in a way that helps
a company sell more EpiPens--

00:15:48.015 --> 00:15:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --but that
really starts to say, hey,

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.326 align:middle line:84%
we've got a runaway
rates of these diseases.

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
These are epidemics that
are happening to our kids.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:55.075 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:15:55.075 --> 00:15:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And
they're not genetic.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.960 align:middle line:84%
There's an environmental
trigger here,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.800 align:middle line:84%
and we need to start
focusing on that.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.008 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And there was a
red flag there, certainly,

00:16:03.008 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
when you have Kraft
as primary sponsor,

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.454 align:middle line:90%
including of the research.

00:16:06.454 --> 00:16:08.120 align:middle line:84%
Something's not right
with that picture,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.328 align:middle line:84%
because it's always going
to be skewed toward whoever

00:16:10.328 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:84%
the-- I mean, that's just
the nature of research.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:84%
It tends to favor
those funding it.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, at the
time, I just thought,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
maybe they have an incentive
to learn about food allergies

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.893 align:middle line:84%
because, obviously,
this is a core customer.

00:16:21.893 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was
willing to give them

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.560 align:middle line:84%
the benefit of the
doubt that early on.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.967 align:middle line:84%
But they became so
aggressive against me

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:30.550 align:middle line:84%
that that's when it
started to change.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And I think it was
in the fall of,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.409 align:middle line:84%
like, around October of
2006 when I was still

00:16:35.409 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:84%
trying to learn
about food allergies,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and getting everything I
could about food allergies,

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.980 align:middle line:84%
because I now was
running this website.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:43.690 align:middle line:84%
And this little study
popped out where

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:49.610 align:middle line:84%
the EPA had issued a $440,000
grant to some small university.

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And the title of the article
was "Do Genetically-Engineered

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.910 align:middle line:90%
Foods Cause Food Allergies?".

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is 2006,
so I'm thinking,

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.060 align:middle line:84%
what's a
genetically-engineered food?

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.497 align:middle line:84%
Because I've never
heard of that.

00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And again, to kind of
start down that rabbit

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.746 align:middle line:84%
hole, and I'm learning about
genetically-engineered foods,

00:17:04.746 --> 00:17:07.440 align:middle line:84%
how they had been
introduced 10 years earlier.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.082 align:middle line:84%
And so here it is, 10 years
later, that the EPA is saying,

00:17:10.082 --> 00:17:11.290 align:middle line:90%
do they cause food allergies?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
well, why didn't we

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
ask this question 10
years ago, before this

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
was introduced into
the food supply?

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know,
that was when--

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.646 align:middle line:84%
I mean, truly, I think that's
when the story really began.

00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:24.280 align:middle line:10%
I sort of I joke, like, that
beginning stage, with this,

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.450 align:middle line:10%
kind of, food allergy
space was preparing me--

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.158 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:17:27.158 --> 00:17:28.970 align:middle line:10%
>> O'BRIEN: --for what
was about to happen.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.553 align:middle line:10%
And so I reached out
to the researcher

00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:10%
there at that university,
and I said, are you

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.930 align:middle line:10%
aware of the runway
rates of allergies

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.600 align:middle line:10%
we're seeing in children?

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:84%
The rates, the prescription
of EpiPen is escalating.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Are you aware of this?

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.144 align:middle line:90%
And how is this being studied?

00:17:44.144 --> 00:17:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And the more that I started
to meet with allergists,

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:84%
I would sit down with
somebody and I would say,

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.240 align:middle line:84%
is a child allergic
to the soy that's

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.680 align:middle line:84%
been consumed for
thousands of years,

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.770 align:middle line:84%
or are they allergic to this
genetically-engineered soy that

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.592 align:middle line:90%
was introduced in 1996?

00:17:58.592 --> 00:18:01.050 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, just like my kids
that day, the allergists just

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
look at you like, what
are you talking about?

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were so illiterate
on genetically-modified foods.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And at that point
I'm thinking, am I

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.890 align:middle line:84%
the only one who didn't
know that we had introduced

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.390 align:middle line:84%
these new ingredients
into our food supply?

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But the more that I
spoke with allergists

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and other organizations,
I realized

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.410 align:middle line:84%
how little people knew
about this sudden change.

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:25.895 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was a huge
fundamental change to the way

00:18:25.895 --> 00:18:28.320 align:middle line:84%
that we produced
food in our country.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that fall really
began this investigative work

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.500 align:middle line:84%
into genetically-engineered
foods,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.510 align:middle line:84%
how they had been
introduced in the 1990s, how

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:84%
some of the concerns from
the World Health Organization

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.575 align:middle line:90%
were over their allergenicity.

00:18:43.575 --> 00:18:45.525 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I'm
sitting on this story

00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:49.450 align:middle line:84%
that, in all candor, I didn't
really want to own, you know?

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to know it.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty scary.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was realizing that
there was one corporation that

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.634 align:middle line:84%
literally was responsible
for the majority

00:18:59.634 --> 00:19:02.050 align:middle line:84%
of these ingredients, of these
genetically-modified foods.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.740 align:middle line:10%
And as I looked at
my kitchen cupboard,

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.474 align:middle line:10%
I thought, their ingredients are
in everything in my kitchen--

00:19:07.474 --> 00:19:09.640 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Almost everything
processed and prepared.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.760 align:middle line:10%
>> O'BRIEN: --but
it's not labeled.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.509 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, you
know, when I buy Kraft,

00:19:12.509 --> 00:19:14.300 align:middle line:10%
or when I would buy
the yogurts, or when

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:10%
I would buy the Leggo
My Eggo waffles,

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:10%
you knew the brand
you were buying.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:10%
When you buy a shirt,
a car, anything,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.135 align:middle line:10%
you know the brand
you're buying.

00:19:21.135 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, I
was like, this brand,

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.640 align:middle line:84%
this company I've
never heard of.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And to me, again,
I just thought,

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.174 align:middle line:90%
I must have been clueless.

00:19:28.174 --> 00:19:28.840 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, and of course,
most people are clueless.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, unless they've
chosen to make a study of it,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.020 align:middle line:90%
that's true.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And which, thank
God, you took on.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.850 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, one of
the most shameful moments

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:44.180 align:middle line:84%
in my long media
career was being

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.990 align:middle line:84%
enticed into do--
it wasn't enticed,

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.250 align:middle line:90%
I was an environmental reporter.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.455 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
and this was in 1992,

00:19:51.455 --> 00:19:54.080 align:middle line:84%
so you can kind of get the time
line of what's about to happen,

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.419 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto-- not
knowing at that time

00:19:56.419 --> 00:19:58.460 align:middle line:84%
it was Monsanto-- it was
University of California

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.010 align:middle line:84%
at Davis who Monsanto was
doing a lot of research there.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And they were introducing
their Flavr Savr tomato, right?

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.030 align:middle line:84%
That was kind of the big
thing where it all began.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Tomatoes that won't rot
on the store shelves.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.496 align:middle line:84%
And I did not understand
the ramifications at all

00:20:11.496 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:90%
when I did the story on it.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I just put it out there,
hey, this new development

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:90%
is occurring in agriculture.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And it was years later
before I found out

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.780 align:middle line:84%
the nature of what
they were doing.

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And Monsanto's-- I mean, you
see the headlines regularly,

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto, most evil
corporation on the planet.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if you look at it
in terms of all the subterfuge,

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.030 align:middle line:84%
the attempts to shut
people like you up,

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.520 align:middle line:84%
stop people from putting
information out and objecting

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.460 align:middle line:90%
to it.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Forget all that's going
on around the globe

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:84%
with those seeds that won't
reproduce and so forth.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about a fairly
substantial amount of clout

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that company has to
stop forward progress,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.919 align:middle line:90%
and having labeling, et cetera.

00:20:50.919 --> 00:20:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what
you've been fighting for.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.240 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, you know,
so as I kind of truly stumbled

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.930 align:middle line:84%
on this corporation, Monsanto,
and I can remember the night I

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.240 align:middle line:84%
pulled up the ticker
symbol, and it's M-O-N,

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.774 align:middle line:84%
and out flew this $70
billion company at the time.

00:21:03.774 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
And I looked across the
table at my husband, I said,

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.525 align:middle line:84%
have you ever heard
of this company?

00:21:07.525 --> 00:21:08.150 align:middle line:90%
And he says no.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, it's
in everything we eat!

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know,
again, it was like, OK,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.290 align:middle line:84%
I've got to own
this cluelessness

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.820 align:middle line:90%
and dig into this thing.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And so as I did,
you know, again,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.370 align:middle line:84%
it was the financial analyst
in me, immediately, I'm like,

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:84%
this is a brilliant
business model.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:26.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a chemical company
that is using their chemical

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.900 align:middle line:84%
technology to help engineer
certain traits into the food

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
supply, and as they did it,
they then own that trait.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.410 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And it enabled
them to basically patent seeds.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that had never
been done before, you know?

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:38.398 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:21:38.398 --> 00:21:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And so all of
a sudden, in the 1990s,

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:84%
you've got this new technology
and this whole new operating

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.422 align:middle line:84%
system that's being imposed on
farmers and imposed on seeds,

00:21:46.422 --> 00:21:46.922 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:21:46.922 --> 00:21:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It's horrible.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: I mean, we
grew up with Microsoft,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and you saw what an
operating system did.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And it required that you use
a whole suite of products.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.400 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, that's what
the chemical company did.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So it engineered these
seeds so that they

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.410 align:middle line:84%
could withstand these
chemicals, you know?

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.784 align:middle line:84%
And again, I thought, if I
was on the board of directors,

00:22:00.784 --> 00:22:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I would say this is an
amazing business model.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Kudos.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.917 align:middle line:90%
Hats off.

00:22:03.917 --> 00:22:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't even
have to label it,

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
so nobody knows that
this change has happened.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Meantime, they can just
routinely douse these food

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.480 align:middle line:84%
crops like soy and corn
with all of their chemicals.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.630 align:middle line:84%
So I saw the business
model, and it truly

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:17.910 align:middle line:90%
was a brilliant business model.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.620 align:middle line:84%
But as I started to
look it, you know,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
and I was analyzing rates of
diseases here in the United

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
States versus overseas, and
how here in the US, I mean,

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.650 align:middle line:84%
the statistics for
autism are escalating.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And overseas in
some countries, it's

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.610 align:middle line:84%
so not prevalent, that they
don't even count autism rates,

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:35.340 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.840 align:middle line:84%
So again, I'm kind
of stepping back,

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, OK, so what
do the other countries do?

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.840 align:middle line:84%
And in 1994, the first
genetically-engineered

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.450 align:middle line:84%
technology was used to create
this artificial growth hormone.

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.900 align:middle line:84%
So they used a
genetically-engineered E coli

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.700 align:middle line:84%
bacteria to create this
artificial growth hormone

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
and inject it into cows, and
help them make more milk.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So again, awesome
business model, you know,

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.620 align:middle line:84%
if that's your goal, is to
help these cows make more milk.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.110 align:middle line:84%
But as countries
around the world said,

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.560 align:middle line:84%
we were doing the
studies, and we

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
saw that these cows are getting
really sick with mastitis,

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.370 align:middle line:84%
and ovarian cysts,
and skin diseases,

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and it was resulting in all
this drug use on these animals,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.520 align:middle line:84%
and all these antibiotics being
pumped into these animals.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Literally, every single
other developed country

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
around the world said, we don't
want this going into our milk.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.890 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what the long-term
effect of this will be.

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And so in 1994, when this
artificial growth hormone found

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
its way into our milk
supply, the United States

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.250 align:middle line:84%
was the only developed country
in the world to allow for it.

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at it,
I mean, all of a sudden,

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't just rethinking
what I was feeding my kids,

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:42.160 align:middle line:84%
or how I might navigate
the grocery store.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I was having to rethink
something much, much bigger,

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:90%
and that was really hard.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
I'm thinking, why

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.220 align:middle line:84%
have we been the only
country to introduce

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.150 align:middle line:84%
this risk into our
dairy, you know?

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And as it was offered
again overseas,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.270 align:middle line:84%
countries overseas,
again, said no, thank you.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.949 align:middle line:84%
We're going to reject the
use of this in our dairy.

00:24:01.949 --> 00:24:04.365 align:middle line:84%
And it was showing that it
increased hormone levels linked

00:24:04.365 --> 00:24:06.102 align:middle line:84%
to breast, prostate,
and colon cancer.

00:24:06.102 --> 00:24:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And so at that
point, you know, again,

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.080 align:middle line:84%
as a mother, there was this
night where I was putting

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.470 align:middle line:84%
our youngest to bed, and
I just held her, thinking,

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.420 align:middle line:84%
how many Sippy Cups have I
poured this milk into, and how

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.060 align:middle line:84%
many bowls of cereal have
I put on for my husband,

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.470 align:middle line:84%
not knowing that there
could be this elevated risk?

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.949 align:middle line:90%
And so it was heartache.

00:24:26.949 --> 00:24:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet, at the same
time, I thought,

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.170 align:middle line:84%
what are the rates of cancer
here versus around the world?

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, that's what
I wanted to ask you next,

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
is when we were talking at
the very top of the show about

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.981 align:middle line:84%
the increase in all the--
one-third of the kids had one

00:24:39.981 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:84%
of the big four A's, you
know, the asthma, allergies,

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:44.710 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:84%
What did you find in other
countries that have really

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.750 align:middle line:84%
rejected a lot of
these technologies?

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: You
know, I mean, again,

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.120 align:middle line:84%
it's really tough because
there's so many environmental

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.325 align:middle line:84%
factors now that are going into
the rates of diseases today.

00:24:57.325 --> 00:24:59.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are 80,000
chemicals that are in use,

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.890 align:middle line:84%
and only about 200 of
them have been tested.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So the food industry
would say, you

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.350 align:middle line:84%
can't conclusively say that
it is just because we've

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:84%
genetically-engineered
the food supply,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.624 align:middle line:84%
and are now pouring
400 million pounds more

00:25:11.624 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:90%
of chemicals on those crops.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't say that,
but at the same time,

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.911 align:middle line:84%
the US has the highest
rates of diseases.

00:25:17.911 --> 00:25:19.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, whether you're
talking about diabetes,

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.480 align:middle line:84%
or obesity, or autism, or
ADHD, allergies, or cancer,

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.707 align:middle line:84%
something like 90% of the
world's ADHD medications

00:25:26.707 --> 00:25:28.165 align:middle line:84%
are sold here in
the United States.

00:25:28.165 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, we only represent 5%
of the world's population.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.302 align:middle line:84%
And so then, there were
also migration studies

00:25:33.302 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:84%
showing that if you were to
move to the United States

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.387 align:middle line:84%
from somewhere like Japan, your
chance of developing cancer

00:25:38.387 --> 00:25:39.220 align:middle line:90%
increases four-fold.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: You know?

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So there were studies
that were indicating

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:44.151 align:middle line:84%
that there were definitely
environmental triggers

00:25:44.151 --> 00:25:45.370 align:middle line:90%
to these diseases.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And as I kept poring
into that research,

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I was then realizing that
only one in 10 cancers

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:84%
are genetic, which means
nine out of 10 of them

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
are non-genetic and
environmentally-triggered.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So as hard as that was to
learn, all of a sudden,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.435 align:middle line:84%
you're realizing we don't
have to be a victim of this.

00:26:00.435 --> 00:26:02.780 align:middle line:84%
If we can start to control
some of those environmental

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.545 align:middle line:84%
exposures, and exercise
precaution, which

00:26:05.545 --> 00:26:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is what countries around
the world said, they said,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.669 align:middle line:84%
you know, we're not going
to introduce this risk

00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:10.900 align:middle line:90%
into our food supply.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.162 align:middle line:84%
There's no long-term
human health data.

00:26:13.162 --> 00:26:15.120 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what the
long-term human health

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
impact will be of a little girl
ingesting artificial growth

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.242 align:middle line:84%
hormone from the age
of one through puberty.

00:26:22.242 --> 00:26:23.950 align:middle line:84%
We have no idea what
that impact will be.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.255 align:middle line:84%
And so these countries
exercised precaution

00:26:26.255 --> 00:26:27.630 align:middle line:84%
and they just
simply kept it out.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:84%
They said, this is
a new technology,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.584 align:middle line:84%
without any long-term
track record.

00:26:31.584 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, as I was
learning that, I thought,

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.015 align:middle line:84%
OK, again, I can see the
business model in this,

00:26:36.015 --> 00:26:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and you can see why
the industry fights

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.900 align:middle line:90%
so hard to not have it labeled.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Because without
labels, they can say

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.290 align:middle line:84%
there is no evidence of harm,
because without that label,

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:46.880 align:middle line:84%
there's no way to
trace the evidence,

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.060 align:middle line:84%
there's no accountability,
and there's no liability.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And so without
that traceability,

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.134 align:middle line:84%
they're able to say, no evidence
of harm, when really, in fact,

00:26:53.134 --> 00:26:54.630 align:middle line:90%
there's just no evidence.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And so as I thought
about that, I

00:26:56.710 --> 00:27:00.772 align:middle line:84%
thought, really, how can we
give consumers this same right

00:27:00.772 --> 00:27:02.480 align:middle line:84%
to know what they're
eating that has been

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.719 align:middle line:84%
given to eaters
around the world?

00:27:04.719 --> 00:27:06.010 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just in the milk.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:07.991 align:middle line:90%
It was in 1996 with the soy.

00:27:07.991 --> 00:27:09.740 align:middle line:84%
They engineered the
soy beans so that they

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.594 align:middle line:84%
could spray these chemicals,
these weed killers, you know?

00:27:12.594 --> 00:27:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I'm learning about
this weed killer, Roundup,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking, that's
the stuff that we're

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.292 align:middle line:84%
told as mothers not to put
under our kitchen sink,

00:27:19.292 --> 00:27:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and yet, it's the same
stuff that they are just

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
routinely spraying our
food crops with, you know?

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.280 align:middle line:84%
And again, that just
complete inconsistency.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.414 align:middle line:84%
And realizing that we just
had had record amounts of weed

00:27:30.414 --> 00:27:31.830 align:middle line:84%
killer sold since
the introduction

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of this new technology
and that seed.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And then with the
corn, again, there

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.110 align:middle line:84%
was growing concern
in California

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:84%
about the spraying of
these insecticides.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And so using this
new technology,

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.920 align:middle line:84%
they were able to
genetically-engineer

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:84%
those insecticidal proteins
into the corn plants, you know?

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.380 align:middle line:84%
So as it grows, it can
release its own insecticide.

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, as a mother,
I'm thinking, well,

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I know to, like, rinse
my fruit and veggies,

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.340 align:middle line:84%
but what do you do when it's
inside the plant, you know?

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What do you
do when it's inside?

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:58.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.548 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And so as I'm
coming through all of this,

00:28:00.548 --> 00:28:04.320 align:middle line:84%
I start to realize that other
countries have exercised a lot

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.400 align:middle line:84%
more precaution, and we just
sort of took this approach that

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.180 align:middle line:84%
it hasn't yet been
proven dangerous.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.530 align:middle line:84%
We're going to allow
it into the food supply

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.860 align:middle line:90%
until it's proven dangerous.

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.587 align:middle line:84%
So the industry is able to
market it, profit off of it.

00:28:16.587 --> 00:28:17.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Powerful lobby.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: Right.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.909 align:middle line:84%
While, you know, any
externalized costs

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:21.950 align:middle line:84%
are falling on the health
of the American public.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And I think as I really started
to realize how sick we are here

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:26.980 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one in three kids
has autism, allergies, ADHD,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.730 align:middle line:90%
or asthma.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.920 align:middle line:84%
The autism rates
are skyrocketing.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.605 align:middle line:90%
It's not just diagnosis anymore.

00:28:34.605 --> 00:28:36.980 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing real conditions
in these children, you know?

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.660 align:middle line:84%
The sale of EpiPens
is almost up 100%.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just real
conditions in these kids.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.109 align:middle line:84%
There was something
in me, again,

00:28:44.109 --> 00:28:45.484 align:middle line:84%
where I just
thought, how is this

00:28:45.484 --> 00:28:47.065 align:middle line:90%
going to impact our country?

00:28:47.065 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:84%
If these kids are too sick
to fight in the military,

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.000 align:middle line:84%
or these kids are too sick
to function in a classroom,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.650 align:middle line:84%
how's it going to affect
productivity in the workplace?

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:57.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, you bet.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.060 align:middle line:84%
All the way down, I
mean, through what is it

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.750 align:middle line:84%
going to do in terms
of chronic diseases

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:04.300 align:middle line:84%
that they're going to be plagued
with as their bodies start

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.480 align:middle line:90%
aging in addition?

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Particularly if you compound
it with more of the same.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.230 align:middle line:84%
So one thing that I really
like, and I was just thinking,

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.860 align:middle line:84%
it might be interesting--
and this is just my thought--

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:16.782 align:middle line:84%
to find out some of the
statistics on all this

00:29:16.782 --> 00:29:18.240 align:middle line:84%
in the Netherlands,
because they've

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.420 align:middle line:84%
been so progressive
for so many years

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.861 align:middle line:84%
to keep so much of this out
of their culture and the food

00:29:23.861 --> 00:29:24.360 align:middle line:90%
supply.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd be curious to know what
their statistics on the kids

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:26.570 align:middle line:90%
are.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: It'd be
a good benchmark.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.156 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:28.156 --> 00:29:29.110 align:middle line:90%
It would be.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But one thing you
discovered along the way

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
was something about
the proteins that

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.900 align:middle line:84%
were involved in the process
of creating the GMOs,

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.870 align:middle line:84%
and when we come down to
these kinds of allergies

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.510 align:middle line:84%
and autoimmune response,
attacking our own bodies,

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.470 align:middle line:90%
a lot of it is protein-based.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.610 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about what
you found out there?

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that's
pretty critical.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:48.870 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: You know, it was.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.161 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I was learning
that a food allergy is when

00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:54.710 align:middle line:84%
your body sees food
proteins as foreign,

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:56.900 align:middle line:84%
and launches this
inflammatory response

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.040 align:middle line:84%
to drive out that foreign
invader, so the food

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
proteins in an egg, or the
food protein in cow's milk,

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.410 align:middle line:90%
or in a soybean.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.230 align:middle line:84%
To then learn that with
genetically-engineered foods,

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.440 align:middle line:84%
you are introducing
a new protein

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.410 align:middle line:84%
into the food supply that
has never existed before.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the scientists
would say, you know,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:84%
these are more tested
than any other food

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.907 align:middle line:90%
product on the market.

00:30:18.907 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:84%
There are no long-term
human health studies.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So you know, that tells
you how weakly tested

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.010 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our food supply is,
if this is the most-tested.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.629 align:middle line:84%
But the food protein they're
saying that they introduced,

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:33.170 align:middle line:84%
of course, would
not be one that they

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:34.712 align:middle line:90%
know would trigger an allergy.

00:30:34.712 --> 00:30:36.670 align:middle line:84%
What scientists around
the world were concerned

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.780 align:middle line:84%
with was that in that process
of genetically-engineering,

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.620 align:middle line:84%
of introducing this thing,
the insertion of that protein

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.010 align:middle line:90%
creates this cascade of effects.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.487 align:middle line:84%
And that's the part where
these new proteins were being

00:30:47.487 --> 00:30:49.820 align:middle line:84%
created, and I was realizing,
as scientists were saying,

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.430 align:middle line:84%
they didn't even have names,
or numbers, or anything

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:53.734 align:middle line:90%
to identify these new proteins.

00:30:53.734 --> 00:30:56.150 align:middle line:84%
So you literally have created
these things that have never

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.020 align:middle line:84%
before existed in
this food supply.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.110 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: This kind of that
Frankenfood type of concept.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: I mean,
people will call it that.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:00.939 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't
necessarily-- I don't

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.570 align:middle line:84%
think it needs that much
of an exaggerated nickname.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:84%
You've really just thrust
this new thing into the seed

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and it's created
something in that thrust.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.920 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of blown
it out and it's

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.850 align:middle line:84%
created something
in that thrust.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.594 align:middle line:84%
And that's the concern,
is what has been created,

00:31:19.594 --> 00:31:21.260 align:middle line:84%
and what are the
long-term effects here?

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And what's so
interesting to me is

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.120 align:middle line:84%
that the proteins
that were introduced

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.910 align:middle line:84%
with this genetic
engineering were so new,

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.100 align:middle line:84%
that these chemical
companies that were doing it

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.010 align:middle line:84%
patent them at the US
Patent and Trademark Office.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.260 align:middle line:84%
So over here, they're saying
we've got to patent this.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.670 align:middle line:84%
It's worth a lot of money
to us because it's unique,

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.767 align:middle line:84%
it's proprietary, it's
this new technology.

00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:42.100 align:middle line:84%
That's what they get at the
Patent and Trademark Office,

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
but over here at
the FDA, they're

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:90%
saying it's all the same.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's like they want to have
their cake, and eat it, too.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So here at the FDA, they
came up with this term

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.895 align:middle line:84%
that it's substantially
equivalent in 1992.

00:31:53.895 --> 00:31:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Which basically means
it doesn't look, smell,

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.850 align:middle line:84%
or taste any
different, but you've

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.715 align:middle line:84%
got a huge compositional
change that's

00:31:59.715 --> 00:32:02.090 align:middle line:84%
occurred in our food supply
that's enabled them to patent

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.381 align:middle line:84%
it on the one hand,
but here at the FDA,

00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:84%
they're saying don't
worry about it.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.012 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:32:07.012 --> 00:32:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at
that, I thought,

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.000 align:middle line:84%
you know, why would
the FDA allow for that?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Why would the FDA, our
food agency here in the US,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.400 align:middle line:84%
have such a different standard
to these food agencies

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:17.960 align:middle line:90%
overseas?

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Because 27 countries around the
world don't allow these foods,

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.067 align:middle line:84%
and over 60 of them label them,
because these food agencies are

00:32:26.067 --> 00:32:27.650 align:middle line:84%
basically saying the
jury's still out.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.130 align:middle line:90%
We just don't know.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.164 align:middle line:84%
And yet, here, you
know, the FDA was just

00:32:31.164 --> 00:32:33.330 align:middle line:84%
on this completely different
page to everybody else.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And so I looked into
that and started

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.330 align:middle line:84%
working with a
researcher at Harvard.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.200 align:middle line:84%
And he basically had
done these studies

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.660 align:middle line:84%
showing how if industry
funds the research,

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.240 align:middle line:90%
it tends to favor industry--

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:45.865 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:32:45.865 --> 00:32:48.910 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --in some hugely
high percentage of the time.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.389 align:middle line:84%
And again, I thought, I'd
seen that as an analyst,

00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:53.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, where these companies
would trot out their research

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.030 align:middle line:84%
findings, and claim that
their products were safe,

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and it's a great
marketing tool when

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.820 align:middle line:90%
you need that in the press.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But then, at the
same time, that was

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.850 align:middle line:84%
what was happening at the
FDA, was that these companies

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.317 align:middle line:84%
were submitting
the safety studies.

00:33:08.317 --> 00:33:10.400 align:middle line:84%
There was no independent
study that was conducted.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.725 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And when I looked at
that and I wanted to know why,

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:16.500 align:middle line:84%
I was really looking at how we
allocate our national budget,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:90%
kind of as a big family.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the FDA
was getting so little a slice

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.410 align:middle line:84%
that they literally didn't
have any funding or resources

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.570 align:middle line:84%
to even be able to conduct
an independent study.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:84%
So they had to rely on
industry-funded data.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
I'm thinking, this

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.330 align:middle line:84%
isn't the first time
we've seen this.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.163 align:middle line:90%
This is the tobacco industry.

00:33:35.163 --> 00:33:36.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Mm-hm.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:36.595 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:33:36.595 --> 00:33:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with some-- Let's
get into some of the food,

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.150 align:middle line:84%
some of allergens
and components,

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and let's start
with baby formula.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.410 align:middle line:84%
If a woman decides
not to breastfeed,

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.010 align:middle line:84%
or she's gone off,
say, a month, or two,

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:51.300 align:middle line:84%
or three months into the
process and switched over

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.240 align:middle line:84%
to baby formulas that have
soy particularly, and also

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.700 align:middle line:84%
talk about the
French government,

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and what they've
done about that.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:01.950 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: You know, I mean,
the baby formula situation here

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
in the United States,
it's less than ideal.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.389 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very sensitive
to the challenges

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:11.340 align:middle line:84%
that a mom is confronted with
when she's dealing with that.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.774 align:middle line:84%
My own sister-in-law had
struggles breastfeeding,

00:34:14.774 --> 00:34:17.960 align:middle line:84%
and she was trying so hard,
and so many moms have contacted

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.920 align:middle line:84%
me, trying so hard to find a
baby formula that doesn't read

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.100 align:middle line:84%
like the side of a science
experiment, you know?

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And as I really started
looking into the baby formulas,

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.060 align:middle line:84%
realizing there's all
kinds of stuff in this baby

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.940 align:middle line:84%
formula that, literally, other
countries around the world

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.429 align:middle line:90%
have either banned or removed.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:39.469 align:middle line:84%
Things like corn syrup, and
all these ingredients that

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
are synthetic and
artificial, and we

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.730 align:middle line:84%
have no idea what the long-term
impact of that might be.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:48.199 align:middle line:84%
And it was to go to the
food agency in the UK,

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I went to the food
agency in France.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:10%
And was really looking
into a study that

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.440 align:middle line:10%
had been conducted by a
researcher named Gideon Lack

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:00.220 align:middle line:10%
and he had, you know, done
this massive study on kids that

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.310 align:middle line:10%
had had peanut
allergy, and realized

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.130 align:middle line:10%
a really high
correlation with those

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:07.290 align:middle line:10%
that had been fed soy formula.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, you
know, why aren't we

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.250 align:middle line:90%
talking about this here?

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we talking about
this potential cross-reactivity

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.330 align:middle line:90%
between the peanut and the soy.

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.520 align:middle line:84%
A child's immune system
is so immature and not

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.250 align:middle line:84%
yet fully developed in
that first year of life.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And you know, if
other countries are

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.180 align:middle line:84%
saying use soy formula
as a last resort.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.990 align:middle line:84%
I was realizing here
in the United States

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.140 align:middle line:84%
that one in four babies were
on this soy formula because

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.870 align:middle line:84%
of these cow milk allergies
that we were seeing.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.787 align:middle line:84%
And so, you know, again,
you kind of pull back

00:35:36.787 --> 00:35:38.745 align:middle line:84%
and you're realizing that
the rest of the world

00:35:38.745 --> 00:35:40.760 align:middle line:84%
is having this conversation
and this dialogue,

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.680 align:middle line:84%
and they are doing
everything they

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.870 align:middle line:84%
can to protect the
health of the children.

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And for the US, as I
was looking at that,

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.000 align:middle line:84%
I thought, OK, we
haven't done that.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.730 align:middle line:84%
These kids have earned the
title generation of RX,

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.380 align:middle line:84%
and I can see the
recurring revenue model

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.870 align:middle line:84%
in a child that's
sick, you know?

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
recurring revenue model

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.960 align:middle line:84%
for the pharmaceutical
company, which is just--

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
it's heartache to
see it that way,

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.490 align:middle line:84%
but that is what can be seen
when you realize a child is

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.079 align:middle line:84%
a diabetic or allergy
kid for a lifetime.

00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But countries around
the world were saying,

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.330 align:middle line:84%
we don't want that
recurring revenue model

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:14.640 align:middle line:90%
on the backs of these kids.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.414 align:middle line:84%
And as I thought
about that in the US,

00:36:16.414 --> 00:36:18.330 align:middle line:84%
I thought, they're only
30% of the population,

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.530 align:middle line:84%
but they're 100% of
the future, you know?

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And it may be a
recurring revenue model

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.839 align:middle line:84%
now that these
pharmaceutical companies are

00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:27.880 align:middle line:84%
able to profit off of all
these rates of diseases

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.770 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing in these
kids, but what's

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.460 align:middle line:84%
the long-term effect of this
going to be on our economy,

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.290 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And already, we're
already spending $0.17

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.790 align:middle line:84%
of every dollar managing disease
and on health care costs.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, you look at
how sick these children are,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.170 align:middle line:84%
with these chronic conditions,
and the escalating costs

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.060 align:middle line:90%
of caring for these kids.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think probably
one of the things that

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:51.950 align:middle line:84%
has surprised me the
most in the eight years

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.801 align:middle line:84%
that I've been doing this is
how quickly those rates have

00:36:54.801 --> 00:36:55.300 align:middle line:90%
escalated.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:55.925 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And in a weird way,
it's a blessing in disguise.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.120 align:middle line:84%
The doctor that wrote
the forward to my book,

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.991 align:middle line:90%
he said that.

00:37:02.991 --> 00:37:05.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, these children are
canaries in the coal mine.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.156 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:37:06.156 --> 00:37:08.529 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And if we
hadn't had that moment,

00:37:08.529 --> 00:37:10.570 align:middle line:84%
that morning where my
daughter had that reaction,

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.111 align:middle line:84%
we would never have learned how
to clean up our food and what

00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:13.780 align:middle line:90%
we were eating.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.730 align:middle line:84%
So it really is a
blessing in disguise.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.591 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's forcing--
parents are really

00:37:18.591 --> 00:37:20.590 align:middle line:84%
going to be the first to
the front line on this,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.520 align:middle line:84%
because suddenly, we're just
paying out the nose when it

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.940 align:middle line:84%
comes to treating these
conditions and these diseases.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, eczema creams
are hugely expensive.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The cost of EpiPen, asthma
inhaler's hugely expensive.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.875 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And once you start
to add all of those things

00:37:34.875 --> 00:37:37.100 align:middle line:84%
on top of each other,
suddenly, the mom is saying,

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.710 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be
a better answer.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I've
talked to various doctors,

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.420 align:middle line:84%
and there are those who
have told me that they have

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.667 align:middle line:84%
the stream of
people, of drug reps,

00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:48.250 align:middle line:84%
coming through their
office every day.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:49.840 align:middle line:90%
And the agenda's really simple.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.280 align:middle line:84%
From the cradle to the grave,
you want them on something.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the business
model of it all.

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.440 align:middle line:90%
Which it is.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's kind
of soul-destroying

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.219 align:middle line:84%
to think that that's
actually going on, but it is.

00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:03.260 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, you're right.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.080 align:middle line:84%
It is going to be up
to the parents that

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.930 align:middle line:84%
are going to have to
spearhead the efforts

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.167 align:middle line:84%
and take responsibility
for not just educating

00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:11.750 align:middle line:84%
themselves, but
feeding their children

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.890 align:middle line:84%
in a very dynamic,
healthful, different way.

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.370 align:middle line:84%
And that means unplugging
from most of the systems,

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.240 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.850 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get back to
the whole subject of formula.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.820 align:middle line:84%
You didn't raise
your kids on formula.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.727 align:middle line:84%
Once they switched over,
they switched to milk, right?

00:38:26.727 --> 00:38:27.310 align:middle line:90%
To cow's milk?

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:28.565 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, you
know, we did use formula.

00:38:28.565 --> 00:38:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we did use
some formula, and it

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.020 align:middle line:84%
wasn't until that
fourth child, where

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.475 align:middle line:84%
I was waking up to how we
had all of these ingredients

00:38:36.475 --> 00:38:37.850 align:middle line:84%
in our food that
literally hadn't

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.310 align:middle line:90%
been there when we were kids.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
sort of the deception,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.320 align:middle line:84%
is that it's the same box
of Kraft Mac and cheese,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.297 align:middle line:84%
it's the same yogurt
company, but there

00:38:46.297 --> 00:38:48.380 align:middle line:84%
are new and different
ingredients in those things.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.100 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.080 align:middle line:90%
I misread that then.

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.250 align:middle line:84%
I thought you had said that
your kids were on cow's milk.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's follow that
model out for just a moment.

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.800 align:middle line:84%
So then we have the bovine
growth hormone issue,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.660 align:middle line:84%
so we have more
allergies happening

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.080 align:middle line:84%
as a result of those things
being shot into the animals.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.370 align:middle line:84%
But what about the notion
of using organic or even

00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
raw milks from another
species, such as goats or cows?

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.820 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
kind of information

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.340 align:middle line:84%
on how the babies
these days that

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.409 align:middle line:90%
might be responding to that?

00:39:21.409 --> 00:39:23.950 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: I don't personally
have that kind of information.

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:27.190 align:middle line:84%
But I know that there
are moms out there

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.610 align:middle line:84%
who are trying all of these
different alternatives.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.887 align:middle line:84%
We see all kinds of
alternative in the marketplace

00:39:32.887 --> 00:39:33.470 align:middle line:90%
to cow's milk.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.785 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Are there some good
alternative formulas out there?

00:39:35.785 --> 00:39:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: There are
starting to be, you know?

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And what's fascinating, I asked
somebody that the other day,

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.067 align:middle line:84%
and they said, you've got
to go to countries overseas.

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, countries overseas
have developed these formulas

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.520 align:middle line:84%
that are of a much
higher quality.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know, we
have these multinational

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.930 align:middle line:84%
corporations here in the
US, so let's lean on them

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:54.350 align:middle line:90%
to bring these products home.

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.145 align:middle line:84%
Because that was
one of the things

00:39:56.145 --> 00:39:59.220 align:middle line:84%
that I started to
notice, was that if we

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.860 align:middle line:84%
allow all of these ingredients
into our food that literally

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.270 align:middle line:84%
have changed the chemical
composition of our food supply,

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.125 align:middle line:84%
and the products
all look the same,

00:40:07.125 --> 00:40:08.750 align:middle line:84%
but they've just been
polluted with all

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:12.080 align:middle line:84%
of these new ingredients, those
same multinational American

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.230 align:middle line:84%
corporations, they
still sell overseas.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.731 align:middle line:84%
So when I looked
at that, I thought,

00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:18.021 align:middle line:84%
they're not including these
ingredients in the products

00:40:18.021 --> 00:40:18.860 align:middle line:90%
they sell overseas.

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.080 align:middle line:84%
They're formulating
things differently.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.620 align:middle line:84%
And that truly hit me just
like a bowling ball to the gut.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.000 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's very sad.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.650 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is very sad.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: You're
just thinking,

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.330 align:middle line:84%
they have not placed the
same value on the lives

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.500 align:middle line:84%
of the American kid that they
placed on the lives of these

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:90%
other kids.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, because their
governments have demanded it,

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.075 align:middle line:84%
otherwise they wouldn't be
able to enter the market,

00:40:34.075 --> 00:40:35.180 align:middle line:90%
so it's just demands.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.680 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: In some cases, the
governments have demanded it.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.619 align:middle line:84%
In some cases,
consumers led, you know.

00:40:39.619 --> 00:40:40.160 align:middle line:90%
For example--

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:40.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah, that's true.

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.006 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --the
artificial dyes.

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, moms in the
UK just realized

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that they wanted to get it out.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There was a study
called the Southampton

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.450 align:middle line:90%
Study that have been done.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.495 align:middle line:84%
And it just showed
this incredible impact

00:40:51.495 --> 00:40:53.620 align:middle line:84%
that these dyes would have
on the behavior of kids,

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.244 align:middle line:84%
and hyperactivity,
and everything else.

00:40:55.244 --> 00:40:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It was conducted again
seven years later,

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:01.040 align:middle line:84%
and it was so compelling to the
parents, the kids, the doctors,

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.242 align:middle line:84%
the scientists, that the
American corporations-- so

00:41:04.242 --> 00:41:06.450 align:middle line:84%
the Walmarts, and the Krafts,
and the Coca-Cola said,

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.170 align:middle line:84%
you know what, we're
going to voluntarily

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
remove artificial dyes from the
products that we sell to kids.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And so it was ahead of
any legislation, you know?

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:15.010 align:middle line:90%
And again--

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:15.816 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
the best scenario.

00:41:15.816 --> 00:41:18.149 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --I can remember
reading through quotes from

00:41:18.149 --> 00:41:20.620 align:middle line:84%
these, you know, Kraft, and
Coca-Cola about how they were

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.290 align:middle line:84%
so willing to work
with the consumer.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:23.884 align:middle line:84%
And that's, again,
when I thought,

00:41:23.884 --> 00:41:26.550 align:middle line:84%
this needs to be a movement here
in the United States, you know,

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.430 align:middle line:90%
people need to know this.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:28.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: They do.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And now, let's go to eggs.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.940 align:middle line:84%
A lot of kids have
allergies to eggs,

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:36.740 align:middle line:84%
but most people are
not aware of the fact

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.650 align:middle line:84%
that eggs are the medium
in which their vaccines are

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:40.890 align:middle line:90%
grown as well.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And so this is
being injected in,

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:45.950 align:middle line:84%
alongside these other
pathogens from the age of three

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:48.280 align:middle line:90%
months and even earlier on.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what have you found
out about the repercussions

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:52.435 align:middle line:90%
of that?

00:41:52.435 --> 00:41:54.143 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: You know,
it was interesting.

00:41:54.143 --> 00:41:55.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the eggs were
close to my heart,

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.940 align:middle line:84%
because that was my
daughter, so suddenly we

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:84%
were kind of at a standstill
with certain vaccines

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.550 align:middle line:90%
because they were egg-based.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I started learning about
genetically-engineered foods,

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.010 align:middle line:84%
I realized that in
countries like France,

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.600 align:middle line:84%
they don't even want
genetically-engineered

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.100 align:middle line:84%
soybeans, or corn,
the thing that we

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.975 align:middle line:84%
feed to all the animals we
eat, the chickens, the cows,

00:42:14.975 --> 00:42:15.915 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:42:15.915 --> 00:42:17.415 align:middle line:84%
In the US, those
cows and everything

00:42:17.415 --> 00:42:18.530 align:middle line:84%
eat the
genetically-engineered food.

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:19.460 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: In other countries,
they say no, thank you.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't want our animals
eating it either, you now?

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So not only are they not
feeding it to their people,

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:26.808 align:middle line:84%
but they don't even
want to feed it

00:42:26.808 --> 00:42:28.360 align:middle line:90%
to their cows or their chickens.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.100 align:middle line:84%
So as I looked into
that, I thought,

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, so then
if a chicken is

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.300 align:middle line:84%
fed genetically-modified
food, what happens to the egg?

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And in France, for
example, that egg

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.045 align:middle line:84%
is labeled as having
come from chicken

00:42:38.045 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:84%
that was fed
genetically-modified food.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.090 align:middle line:84%
So it is labeled all the
way through the food chain.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.350 align:middle line:84%
So I contacted a
researcher at Harvard

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and I said, what is
the difference here?

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.790 align:middle line:84%
What's the impact
of a vaccine being

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:54.000 align:middle line:84%
grown in an organic
egg-- what we now

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.356 align:middle line:84%
have to give the adjective,
organic, whereas before, it

00:42:56.356 --> 00:42:59.900 align:middle line:84%
was just an egg--
versus this egg that

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:03.870 align:middle line:84%
comes from an animal that's
been genetically-engineered fed?

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And she laughed.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:06.530 align:middle line:90%
She said, we have no idea.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:08.020 align:middle line:90%
We have no idea.

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Those studies have
not been conducted.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And you know, again,
it was that realization

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.530 align:middle line:84%
that these kids,
as Dr. Bach said,

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:17.880 align:middle line:90%
are canaries in a coal mine.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.360 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And that there is so
much that we can do to protect

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.270 align:middle line:84%
their health, but we
have to be mindful,

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:84%
and we have to
get the knowledge.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the best vaccine
books that I know of

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.800 align:middle line:84%
is a book called "The Vaccine
Book" by Dr. Bob Sears.

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:37.220 align:middle line:10%
>> O'BRIEN: His dad,
Dr. William Sears,

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:40.635 align:middle line:10%
has been a pediatric expert
in this country for decades.

00:43:40.635 --> 00:43:44.380 align:middle line:10%
He and his wife have written, I
don't know, eight or 10 books.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:48.690 align:middle line:84%
And he was one of the first
to really sound the alarm

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that soy formula,
soy-based formula,

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:54.580 align:middle line:84%
may present risk to
certain children.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And as I was
researching him, that's

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.390 align:middle line:84%
when I learned about his
son, and kind of contacted

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:00.900 align:middle line:90%
the whole family.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.700 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Sears' book on
vaccines, it's very informative.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:07.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, and I think
as parents today,

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.650 align:middle line:84%
with the title
generation RX slapped

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.660 align:middle line:84%
across the front of
our kids, we need

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.102 align:middle line:84%
to have as much
information as we

00:44:14.102 --> 00:44:16.060 align:middle line:84%
can so that we can make
these informed choices.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And it is difficult,
because you do have to end up

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.391 align:middle line:84%
fighting the system a
good part of the way.

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:24.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, part of the home
schooling initiative in general

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.720 align:middle line:84%
has been to keep kids
out from under the burden

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.300 align:middle line:90%
of having those vaccines.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for example,
this is taking

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:33.360 align:middle line:84%
some-- you're having
to kind of circumvent

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.390 align:middle line:84%
the whole system as a
parent to a large extent.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know that
there are certain states

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.220 align:middle line:84%
you can have the child put
in school with certain kind

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.600 align:middle line:84%
of-- what is the
word I'm looking for?

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.350 align:middle line:84%
Where they have exceptions,
such as a religious exception

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.790 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, or some
medical exception

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:84%
written by some
medical professional.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But by and large, you can't
even put your kids in school

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.190 align:middle line:84%
without them having
been vaccinated.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.330 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: I mean, again,
I think the system that

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.070 align:middle line:84%
we've inherited, and
then the assumptions,

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:08.240 align:middle line:84%
and the rules that we sort of
intended to follow, you know,

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.394 align:middle line:84%
in our parents' footsteps,
all of a sudden,

00:45:10.394 --> 00:45:12.310 align:middle line:84%
we're realizing it just
flat out doesn't work.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It doesn't work.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:12.840 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.381 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: This
generation of kids--

00:45:14.381 --> 00:45:17.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and also we
had just a few vaccines as kids.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.680 align:middle line:90%
These guys have what?

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.432 align:middle line:84%
Up to 90 before
the age of seven?

00:45:20.432 --> 00:45:21.140 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.890 align:middle line:90%
It is some jaw-dropping number.

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.060 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I think,
again, Dr. Sears was

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:29.290 align:middle line:84%
smart in his book, because he
suggests a delayed schedule,

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.620 align:middle line:84%
basically acknowledging that
a child's immune system is

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.570 align:middle line:84%
still vulnerable and not fully
developed in the early stages.

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And again, I think,
more importantly,

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.520 align:middle line:84%
especially given the rates of
these diseases, the seriousness

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.370 align:middle line:90%
of food allergies.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that some kid
can be mildly allergic,

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and another kid can
have that same amount

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and go into a life-threatening
allergic reaction.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it's becoming
increasingly hard to sort

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:59.280 align:middle line:84%
of mandate a one-size-fits-all
system on these children.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's why you start
to see these parents popping up

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.360 align:middle line:84%
with these different
organizations, you know?

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is the leading
cause of death

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.280 align:middle line:84%
by disease in kids under
the age of 15 today,

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.547 align:middle line:90%
and the rates are escalating.

00:46:10.547 --> 00:46:12.005 align:middle line:84%
You know, somebody
who's a naysayer

00:46:12.005 --> 00:46:13.380 align:middle line:84%
is going to dismiss
it and say, well,

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.005 align:middle line:84%
that's because we cured measles,
or mumps, and everything else.

00:46:16.005 --> 00:46:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But how do you explain
the escalating rate

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:19.780 align:middle line:90%
of pediatric cancer?

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.863 align:middle line:84%
How do you explain that
there are pediatric cancer

00:46:21.863 --> 00:46:23.560 align:middle line:84%
hospitals going in
around the country?

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.518 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:46:24.518 --> 00:46:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: How do you explain
that you've got oncologists

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.230 align:middle line:84%
writing Op-Eds in the New
England Journal of Medicine

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:32.190 align:middle line:84%
saying, if we don't address
these runaway rates of cancer,

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.120 align:middle line:84%
it's going to buckle
our health care system.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And so again, that's where we've
all inherited these systems,

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:38.670 align:middle line:90%
and it is hard to acknowledge.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you look
at that health care

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:42.861 align:middle line:90%
system in which sickness sells.

00:46:42.861 --> 00:46:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's what keeps
those companies in business.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:45.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
United Healthcare--

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.560 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's who has
the money on Capitol Hill.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.050 align:middle line:90%
That's who has the money.

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:49.216 align:middle line:90%
And those are the lobbyists.

00:46:49.216 --> 00:46:51.705 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: So I think it's
really truly where it gets

00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:55.690 align:middle line:84%
to be a grassroots movement, but
I also think that the private

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:57.720 align:middle line:84%
sector is starting to
come in with solutions.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.160 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, it's because
those escalating health care

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.710 align:middle line:84%
costs are hammering
the companies.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:03.850 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And you've got
a company like Starbucks

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.216 align:middle line:84%
who's spending almost as much on
their health care costs as they

00:47:08.216 --> 00:47:09.430 align:middle line:90%
are on their coffee.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:12.070 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly, they can't be
as profitable, and lucrative,

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and drive their core
competency the way they could,

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.690 align:middle line:84%
because they're all tied
up managing disease.

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.512 align:middle line:84%
So they want to figure out a way
to get their employees healthy,

00:47:19.512 --> 00:47:20.970 align:middle line:84%
and I think you
really are starting

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.734 align:middle line:84%
to see these grassroots,
market-driven solutions.

00:47:23.734 --> 00:47:25.650 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And let's
talk about labeling laws.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:28.233 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know a lot of people
were very disappointed recently

00:47:28.233 --> 00:47:31.235 align:middle line:84%
when Whole Foods announced that
they were going to kind of slow

00:47:31.235 --> 00:47:34.870 align:middle line:84%
it down and take a few years
before they decided to label

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:39.380 align:middle line:84%
their genetically-modified
organisms in the food supply.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:84%
What did you dig up when
you were researching this?

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why do they have to
wait three or four years?

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.370 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: That's a
really good question,

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's really important
that people understand why.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Whole Foods has not only organic
companies in their store,

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:54.450 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of the owners of
these smaller organic companies

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:57.980 align:middle line:84%
are the Nestles, and the Krafts,
and these larger conglomerates.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.170 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Disney, M&M--

00:47:59.170 --> 00:47:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: Right.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:00.565 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --and on and on.

00:48:00.565 --> 00:48:03.110 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And so these
companies are not going to want

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.690 align:middle line:84%
to label genetically-engineered
ingredients, because, again,

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.885 align:middle line:84%
it brings that accountability,
liability, traceability.

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:10.260 align:middle line:84%
So as companies,
they're probably

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.970 align:middle line:84%
going to want to shift out
of the genetically-engineered

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:14.869 align:middle line:84%
ingredient into something
else, and formulate

00:48:14.869 --> 00:48:15.910 align:middle line:90%
the way they do overseas.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:18.076 align:middle line:84%
So they're going to want
to bring that manufacturing

00:48:18.076 --> 00:48:18.720 align:middle line:90%
process home.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.280 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that we
don't have that supply here

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:22.520 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.151 align:middle line:84%
Soybeans are now upward of
90% genetically-modified--

00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:26.150 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right, right.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:28.608 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --so we kind of
have a bottleneck on the supply

00:48:28.608 --> 00:48:30.720 align:middle line:84%
of non-genetically-engineered
soybeans.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.430 align:middle line:84%
So in order to convert fields
from genetically-engineered

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.240 align:middle line:84%
soybeans to
non-genetically-engineered,

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.710 align:middle line:90%
it takes three years.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And so I think by offering
that five-year period,

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.050 align:middle line:84%
they're basically saying,
hey, you can label it,

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:43.500 align:middle line:90%
or you can just get it out.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's interesting.

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.130 align:middle line:90%
That makes total sense.

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Just, again, following
the time frame

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.641 align:middle line:84%
of what it takes to
turn those crops over.

00:48:50.641 --> 00:48:52.140 align:middle line:84%
You're right, three
years, isn't it?

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.681 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And I think what's
interesting is I've heard from

00:48:54.681 --> 00:48:56.320 align:middle line:90%
these global corporations.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.959 align:middle line:84%
I used to lump big foods, sort
of, all together, not at all.

00:48:59.959 --> 00:49:01.500 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
corporations that I

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.614 align:middle line:84%
have worked with who have high
level executives with sons

00:49:04.614 --> 00:49:05.530 align:middle line:90%
with autism, you know?

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.130 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And
the dad has said,

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.480 align:middle line:90%
your work has changed my life.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, then
we can't just sit here.

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:10.970 align:middle line:90%
We have to do something.

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And I know that they're
trying to figure out a way

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.193 align:middle line:84%
to create change, and
that's where, again, I

00:49:15.193 --> 00:49:17.520 align:middle line:84%
think this grassroots
movement is so critical.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Because not only does it give
politicians a political cover

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:25.320 align:middle line:84%
to start voting for more
aggressive labeling practices,

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.190 align:middle line:84%
but it also gives these
companies political cover

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:30.670 align:middle line:84%
to then go to these boards of
directors, who may or may not

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.782 align:middle line:84%
realize how much this situation
has advanced so quickly.

00:49:33.782 --> 00:49:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:36.615 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: To be able to
go to that board and say,

00:49:36.615 --> 00:49:37.570 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that initiative in
California that was demanding

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:43.595 align:middle line:84%
labelling failed, but 6 million
people in California want

00:49:43.595 --> 00:49:45.220 align:middle line:84%
the right to know
what's in their food,

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.630 align:middle line:84%
and at what point does it
become the financial obligation

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.630 align:middle line:84%
of that company to start
to respond to this consumer

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:51.590 align:middle line:90%
demand.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where I think,
you know, in these corporations,

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:58.910 align:middle line:84%
in these big food
corporations, are parents just

00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:59.810 align:middle line:90%
like all of us.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And they need the political
cover to do the right thing.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they are in
a very broken system.

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Their jobs drive profitability
straight to the bottom line,

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.764 align:middle line:84%
and that means use the
cheapest ingredients possible.

00:50:13.764 --> 00:50:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: But it's
starting to boomerang back,

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:18.720 align:middle line:84%
because now they're paying all
this for their own health care

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.220 align:middle line:90%
costs.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So we're really at this point, I
think, where the consumer could

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.290 align:middle line:84%
play an incredibly
important and valuable role.

00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I agree.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about how we
protect our own families

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.610 align:middle line:90%
and our own kids.

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, anybody who
isn't already aware

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.440 align:middle line:84%
that their child is reacting
to a food in a certain way

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.300 align:middle line:84%
as a result of an allergy
probably has a clue of it now.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about how you
start feeding kids once you

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:46.040 align:middle line:84%
realize that soy is in almost
every processed and packaged

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.342 align:middle line:90%
food, just as one example.

00:50:47.342 --> 00:50:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: So as I was looking
at this little one that had

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.883 align:middle line:90%
this kind of traditional--

00:50:50.883 --> 00:50:51.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.170 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --allergic
reaction that you read about,

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:55.503 align:middle line:84%
where the girl kisses her
boyfriend and has the allergic

00:50:55.503 --> 00:50:58.830 align:middle line:84%
reaction, this immediate,
life-threatening reaction.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.510 align:middle line:84%
This delayed food
allergic reaction

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:04.220 align:middle line:84%
can present as eczema, or
chronic ear infections,

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.510 align:middle line:90%
or bronchial stuff.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden, I
was looking at my other kids

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.330 align:middle line:84%
realizing, you know, these guys
have something going on, too.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So once I kind of started to
look at the spectrum of food

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.070 align:middle line:84%
allergies, from kind of
severe to these, kind of,

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:18.820 align:middle line:84%
mildly-annoying things,
really, I thought,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.351 align:middle line:90%
we've just got to clean it up.

00:51:20.351 --> 00:51:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And there was this moment
where I stood in the kitchen

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.335 align:middle line:84%
and literally looked in
my kitchen cupboards,

00:51:24.335 --> 00:51:26.490 align:middle line:84%
and I just thought, I do not
even know where to start,

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:26.990 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, boxes of mac and
cheese, tubes of blue yogurt,

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:31.730 align:middle line:90%
frozen nuggets in the freezer.

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:33.240 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was so bad.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.519 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I've
got to start somewhere.

00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And so for us, we started with
getting that artificial growth

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.680 align:middle line:90%
hormone out of the dairy.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.001 align:middle line:90%
It was, to me--

00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:43.250 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So you went to
organic on your milk supply,

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.320 align:middle line:90%
or you cut the milk?

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: We went organic
on the milk, initially,

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and then we were traveling
and we didn't have access

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.110 align:middle line:90%
to organic milk.

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I just
thought, I can't buy

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:56.830 align:middle line:84%
the stuff that's polluted
with all this stuff.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:51:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And so we just went a
week without the milk,

00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and that's when one of
the boys just, like,

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:01.960 align:middle line:90%
immediately improved.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.224 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:52:02.224 --> 00:52:02.315 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:52:02.315 --> 00:52:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And I thought, It
cannot be that simple or that

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.090 align:middle line:90%
obvious.

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:06.756 align:middle line:84%
Surely somebody would
have told me this.

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And we came home and he
went back on the milk,

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:09.770 align:middle line:84%
and just immediately
tanked again.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, I'm
going to take him of it.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And again, what I would
suggest to any parent is,

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:17.600 align:middle line:84%
find a doctor that's willing
to work with you on this.

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Older generation doctors
sometimes are very entrenched.

00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:22.600 align:middle line:84%
They were schooled a
long, long time ago,

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.340 align:middle line:84%
before we talked
about organic food,

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.394 align:middle line:84%
before we talked about GMOs or
genetically-engineered food,

00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:29.560 align:middle line:84%
long before high-fructose
corn syrup was introduced.

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:31.927 align:middle line:84%
So they haven't had
the schooling on this.

00:52:31.927 --> 00:52:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Doctors that are younger, that
may have young kids themselves,

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:37.790 align:middle line:84%
are much more up to
speed on the research.

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The American Academy
of Pediatrics

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.316 align:middle line:84%
just issued a report
on organic food,

00:52:42.316 --> 00:52:43.690 align:middle line:84%
because what they
were seeing was

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that all these patients were
coming into the doctor's

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:48.840 align:middle line:84%
offices and they were asking the
pediatricians these questions.

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.080 align:middle line:84%
The pediatricians
didn't know the answer.

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.650 align:middle line:84%
What is the value
of organic food?

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:54.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not as
contaminated with

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:56.300 align:middle line:84%
genetically-engineered
ingredients.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:58.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not as contaminated
with pesticides,

00:52:58.140 --> 00:52:59.140 align:middle line:90%
and all these chemicals.

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, as we started
to make those changes,

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:05.660 align:middle line:84%
yes, the first was
switching to organic milk.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Then it was simply--
I just simply tried

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:09.660 align:middle line:90%
to eat less processed food.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- I kept
telling the kids

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:14.200 align:middle line:84%
we're just going to
eat less fake food.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we were snack
packs, everything was fake.

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I thought, I'm
going to take that pack--

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Were they
good sports about it?

00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, I did it in
baby steps, because I thought,

00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:23.700 align:middle line:84%
I didn't potty train
them overnight.

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:23.990 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Sure.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.410 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And I didn't
wean them from a Sippy Cup

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:26.210 align:middle line:90%
overnight.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.600 align:middle line:84%
So literally, I had
all this mac and cheese

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.290 align:middle line:84%
with fluorescent stuff in
the cupboards, and I thought,

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:33.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll just use half
the packet of powder.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And we weaned them off of
it, and we went at a pace

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:39.740 align:middle line:84%
that they were OK
with, we were OK with,

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.740 align:middle line:90%
the family budget was OK with.

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, there's so
many things you're considering

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.020 align:middle line:84%
as you start to
make the changes.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now we look at
the whole notion of an industry

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that is trying to accommodate
these various allergies.

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.300 align:middle line:84%
At least, that's what
it appears to be.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And so you have, for
example, gluten-free foods

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:58.950 align:middle line:90%
are labeled very easily.

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you have something
that say gluten-free,

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:84%
all organic
ingredients, does that

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:09.545 align:middle line:84%
guarantee that it's not
going to contain GMOs?

00:54:09.545 --> 00:54:11.244 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: If it
says USDA organic,

00:54:11.244 --> 00:54:12.410 align:middle line:90%
which is that little symbol.

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Which, quite
honestly at the time,

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:16.750 align:middle line:84%
I thought was just like
a little marketing tool,

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:19.540 align:middle line:84%
it actually represents a
legal standard of production,

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and by law, it means that
artificial growth hormones,

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:24.760 align:middle line:84%
artificial dyes,
genetically-engineered

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.540 align:middle line:84%
ingredients are not allowed to
be included in the production

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.930 align:middle line:90%
process for that.

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So by law, that
USDA organic symbol

00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:34.670 align:middle line:84%
means that it's free from all
of these artificial ingredients

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:36.310 align:middle line:84%
that are new, that
have been introduced

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:37.280 align:middle line:90%
in the last 10 or 20 years.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.571 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So it seems to
me, that's really the easiest

00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:41.160 align:middle line:90%
and first course of action.

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's more
expensive, so this

00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:45.760 align:middle line:84%
is where it gets down to
a lot of consumer choices.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.720 align:middle line:84%
But it seems the first thing is
to go organic across the board.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.540 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, you know,
and I mean, again, like,

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.695 align:middle line:84%
in a perfect world, you'd be
able to say every American

00:54:52.695 --> 00:54:55.050 align:middle line:84%
should eat organic, but as
I really looked at the cost

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:55.990 align:middle line:90%
of organic food--

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.285 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's expensive.

00:54:56.285 --> 00:54:58.534 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --you know, I'm
realizing this is way more

00:54:58.534 --> 00:54:59.385 align:middle line:90%
expensive, and why?

00:54:59.385 --> 00:55:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, as a national
family, as a big family,

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.319 align:middle line:84%
our budget is being
used to support

00:55:05.319 --> 00:55:07.610 align:middle line:84%
the growing of the food with
the genetically-engineered

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:08.879 align:middle line:90%
and the chemicals.

00:55:08.879 --> 00:55:10.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the farmers
that are growing

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.086 align:middle line:84%
things organically, which means,
by law, without all this stuff,

00:55:13.086 --> 00:55:14.730 align:middle line:84%
have to pay fees
to prove it's safe,

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.170 align:middle line:84%
then have to pay
fees to label it.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:17.980 align:middle line:84%
So their whole cost of
production is higher.

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:19.438 align:middle line:84%
And as I looked at
that, I thought,

00:55:19.438 --> 00:55:21.280 align:middle line:84%
there's no American
that would choose this.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.327 align:middle line:84%
These are our taxpayer
dollars, and shouldn't we

00:55:24.327 --> 00:55:26.410 align:middle line:84%
start to make enough noise
to where these taxpayer

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:29.477 align:middle line:84%
dollars are being used to
support organic agriculture, as

00:55:29.477 --> 00:55:30.810 align:middle line:90%
opposed to the stuff that's so--

00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:31.070 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN:
--chemically-intensive.

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.138 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But what
about another option,

00:55:34.138 --> 00:55:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and that is to buy organic
ingredients which aren't that

00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:40.520 align:middle line:84%
expensive, and then start
making things ourselves again?

00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Just get back in the
kitchen, roll the sleeves up,

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.880 align:middle line:84%
make healthy little snacks,
and take the time to do it.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the thing
is, our mothers,

00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and our mothers' mothers
made our little snacks.

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:53.350 align:middle line:84%
We didn't go for the
quick and easy choice.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So how does your story
interface with the fact

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that we have to take
personal responsibility

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.274 align:middle line:84%
for some production
on our own here?

00:56:00.274 --> 00:56:01.940 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: You know,
you do, but again,

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:04.140 align:middle line:84%
I think you can't make the
perfect the enemy of the good,

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.348 align:middle line:84%
and so we sort of have this
notion of this apron-clad

00:56:06.348 --> 00:56:08.017 align:middle line:84%
grandmother making
these big pies.

00:56:08.017 --> 00:56:10.100 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it doesn't have
to be that complicated.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.500 align:middle line:90%
Beans and rice is pretty simple.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:12.340 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.320 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --it doesn't have
to be the five-course meal.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:16.278 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's giving
yourself permission to,

00:56:16.278 --> 00:56:19.320 align:middle line:84%
sort of, let go of those
expectations, and saying this

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:22.222 align:middle line:84%
is modern day society, and we
do have two working parents, so

00:56:22.222 --> 00:56:23.430 align:middle line:90%
what's it going to look like?

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:25.138 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe it's
quesadillas and beans.

00:56:25.138 --> 00:56:26.920 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to
be some meal that's--

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yeah,
that's cool, too.

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:27.900 align:middle line:90%
But at least--

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.190 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --been cooking
for five hours, you know?

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.856 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:56:29.856 --> 00:56:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just saying that
organic prepared foods

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:34.820 align:middle line:90%
are really expensive.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:38.460 align:middle line:84%
However, organic
ingredients aren't, per se.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And even if you say,
like, an organic tortilla,

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:44.510 align:middle line:84%
for example, and a raw cheese,
or something like that.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:47.212 align:middle line:84%
A person can do that, and
that's still fairly convenient.

00:56:47.212 --> 00:56:49.420 align:middle line:84%
But I'm speaking more of
the little convenient things

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.711 align:middle line:84%
we give our kids, like if
you want to give them snacks.

00:56:51.711 --> 00:56:53.449 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you do one
batch on a Sunday.

00:56:53.449 --> 00:56:54.990 align:middle line:84%
A batch of something
that can kind of

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.610 align:middle line:90%
last the week that's healthier.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:56.693 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, exactly.

00:56:56.693 --> 00:56:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And if you really look into
packaged and processed foods,

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the majority
of the cost associated

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:03.690 align:middle line:90%
with that is with the marketing.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:04.590 align:middle line:90%
And you know--

00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:07.396 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --licensing Dora
the Explorer and all of these

00:57:07.396 --> 00:57:07.940 align:middle line:90%
figures--

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --to help
sell those products.

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:13.050 align:middle line:84%
And so as you realize that you
can just make these baby steps,

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:13.550 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:13.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:14.900 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: And I mean,
we did the snack packs.

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And so then, all of a sudden,
I was showing up after school

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.250 align:middle line:84%
with oranges and
apples, you know?

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:18.680 align:middle line:90%
And so it was just a--

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very cool.

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.930 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: --very slight shift.

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:20.680 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's right.

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:23.138 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: But it was taking
those baby steps that we were

00:57:23.138 --> 00:57:24.214 align:middle line:90%
able to do it.

00:57:24.214 --> 00:57:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We only have
a couple minutes left.

00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Very quickly, what
about the whole notion,

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I think it's called
the hygiene hypothesis,

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that we're
sterilizing ourselves to death,

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.080 align:middle line:90%
so to speak?

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.312 align:middle line:84%
Because kids aren't able to
just get down and get grubby

00:57:37.312 --> 00:57:38.770 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
stuff their bodies

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.910 align:middle line:84%
may need to start building a
healthy digestive and immune

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:42.440 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> O'BRIEN: Yeah.

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:43.140 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.764 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's kind of
this Purell theory

00:57:44.764 --> 00:57:48.280 align:middle line:84%
that, like, we are all
manic with hand sanitizer,

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.110 align:middle line:84%
and somehow, that's
disrupting the immune system.

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I think if you're going to talk
about the hygiene hypothesis,

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:56.867 align:middle line:84%
you also have to talk
about all this junk that's

00:57:56.867 --> 00:57:58.700 align:middle line:84%
being pumped into animals
and into our food.

00:57:58.700 --> 00:57:58.810 align:middle line:90%
And so if--

00:57:58.810 --> 00:57:59.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: --the meat we eat
is suddenly full of all kinds

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.937 align:middle line:84%
of things like chlorine, and
antibiotics like the chicken is

00:58:05.937 --> 00:58:08.020 align:middle line:84%
today-- I mean, that's
what they use to treat it--

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that is having a pretty major
impact on a child's immune

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.840 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.786 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, the
hygiene hypothesis,

00:58:13.786 --> 00:58:15.160 align:middle line:84%
you can talk about
it externally,

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.044 align:middle line:84%
but let's talk about
it internally, too.

00:58:17.044 --> 00:58:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.901 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't agree more.

00:58:18.901 --> 00:58:19.400 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.710 align:middle line:90%
We only have a minute left.

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.590 align:middle line:10%
What can a person do
to start becoming--

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.490 align:middle line:10%
besides reading your book, which
is very well-done, by the way,

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.990 align:middle line:10%
"The Unhealthy Truth"-- what
else can they do to start

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:31.130 align:middle line:10%
becoming very active, and
taking an active role in taking

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:32.330 align:middle line:10%
their kids' health back?

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:34.960 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: Well, as we
really got into this,

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Allergy Kids is a
501(c)(3) nonprofit,

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and our work is advocacy work.

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And also creating
awareness so that we

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.080 align:middle line:90%
can start to fund the science.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.490 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
we want to be doing

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:46.323 align:middle line:84%
is what we call the
Pregnancy Project, where

00:58:46.323 --> 00:58:48.660 align:middle line:84%
you can take moms and put
them on an organic diet.

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:50.243 align:middle line:10%
And we can see what
the impact of that

00:58:50.243 --> 00:58:51.944 align:middle line:10%
can be over the
lifetime, and see

00:58:51.944 --> 00:58:53.110 align:middle line:10%
what these rates of disease.

00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:55.530 align:middle line:10%
Let's see a drop in autism,
and cancer, and allergies,

00:58:55.530 --> 00:58:56.780 align:middle line:10%
and things like that.

00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.950 align:middle line:10%
So go to allergykids.com, where
you can join the family there.

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:middle line:10%
There's so many
organizations like Just Label

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:04.420 align:middle line:10%
It who are really
out there, helping

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.950 align:middle line:10%
to push for the labeling of
genetically-engineered food,

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:10.590 align:middle line:10%
saying, you know, the FDA does
have the authority to do this.

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:12.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
wait for legislation.

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.716 align:middle line:84%
And really to engage
in your communities,

00:59:14.716 --> 00:59:16.590 align:middle line:84%
because I think there
are so many people that

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:17.920 align:middle line:90%
are so passionate.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Find a friend, get
involved, because it really

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.220 align:middle line:84%
is fun creating this change,
and it's so important.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How do you
like your life these days,

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.540 align:middle line:84%
compared to when you were
wearing your little heels

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:29.900 align:middle line:84%
and business suit every
day on Wall Street?

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:33.160 align:middle line:84%
>> O'BRIEN: You know, I
mean, I loved those guys.

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a great job.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was fun and it was
really-- it was an amazing job.

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think to be part
of a movement that

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:43.910 align:middle line:84%
is so critical to the
health of our families

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.730 align:middle line:84%
and the health of our
countries, I'm so grateful,

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:49.660 align:middle line:84%
because I'm just inspired every
day by the stories that I hear.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just heard
from a military mom,

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.841 align:middle line:84%
you hear from grandparents, and
for that, I'm just so grateful.

00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, I'm sure
they're very grateful to you

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:57.590 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for all the hard work.
