00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.336 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: Baby
Boomers are among the most

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.572 align:middle line:84%
high-maintenance
people in the world.

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:39.573 align:middle line:90%
It's true that science

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.375 align:middle line:84%
and technology are
making it possible

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.711 align:middle line:84%
to slow the aging process,
but the Boomers want more.

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel 30 at 60.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.449 align:middle line:84%
How real is this
as an expectation?

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.552 align:middle line:84%
Nick Delgado has studied
and worked alongside some

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.554 align:middle line:84%
of the most prominent people
in the world of wellness

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:58.158 align:middle line:84%
and anti-aging and says there
are genuine breakthroughs

00:00:58.158 --> 00:01:01.228 align:middle line:84%
to extend vibrant health
mentally and physically.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.997 align:middle line:84%
But first we have to
address our hormonal health.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.132 align:middle line:90%
Nick is here with us today

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:84%
to share this wealth
of information.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.169 align:middle line:84%
And hormonal health has
so much misunderstanding

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.305 align:middle line:90%
around it right now.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:16.109 align:middle line:84%
From the argument over HRTs
and you know the potential

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:18.245 align:middle line:84%
for breast cancer in
women, to bioidenticals,

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.681 align:middle line:90%
to homeopathic hormones.

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.684 align:middle line:84%
And you look at it from a much
more holistic point of view

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:26.253 align:middle line:84%
than just any one
of those things.

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Delgado:
Correct, you know I think

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.289 align:middle line:84%
that when anyone wants
to optimize their body,

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.592 align:middle line:84%
their mind it starts
with hormones.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Hormones affect literally
every organ, every cell.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.265 align:middle line:84%
The heart, for example,
has the most receptor cites

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:42.436 align:middle line:84%
for testosterone, and so
it requires testosterone

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.737 align:middle line:90%
to beat every day.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:47.574 align:middle line:84%
Every organ in the body depends
on a signal that's triggered

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.577 align:middle line:84%
by the release of hormones
from various organs,

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:56.049 align:middle line:84%
and these organs really start
to age; they start to shrink;

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.616 align:middle line:90%
they start to decline.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.686 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think there's
a doctor in the world

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:04.091 align:middle line:84%
who would deny that if
someone had hypothyroidism --

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.092 align:middle line:90%
that is the inability...

00:02:05.092 --> 00:02:06.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...to
produce enough thyroid --

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.628 align:middle line:84%
that they wouldn't give them
at least a prescription.

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:10.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, they
-- absolutely.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.999 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And the
concern I have is

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.035 align:middle line:84%
that there's this
big controversy.

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:16.003 align:middle line:90%
There's two categories.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:18.372 align:middle line:84%
One is there's performance
hormones

00:02:18.372 --> 00:02:19.673 align:middle line:84%
that have been abused
by certain...

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:21.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Steroids, yeah.

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:22.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.143 align:middle line:84%
And keep in mind the
street definition --

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:25.412 align:middle line:90%
definition of steroids would be

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:29.783 align:middle line:84%
in my mind excessively high
dosages, and typically altered

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:32.786 align:middle line:84%
or chemically different than
what's naturally in the body.

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:36.156 align:middle line:84%
Because see bioidentical
hormones are also classified

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:38.558 align:middle line:90%
by textbook as steroids as well.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:42.462 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking about,
though, is physiologic dosages.

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:43.797 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:45.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Where the body
requires or sustains itself.

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:48.567 align:middle line:84%
And in the case of where
I started with thyroid

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.337 align:middle line:84%
if a person can't
produce enough thyroid --

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.707 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, this can happen
at birth as -- as a child.

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:54.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:55.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: One sign,
for example,

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.311 align:middle line:84%
is I ask people often
do you have flat feet?

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.579 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.481 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: It's interesting
that the arch depends

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.517 align:middle line:84%
on sufficient thyroid
to form completely.

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:06.019 align:middle line:84%
And if you have flat
feet it's likely that...

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.255 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...early on
you had a thyroid disorder.

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.991 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not the
only indicator.

00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.693 align:middle line:84%
Reflexes, a doctor who does
a very thorough physical

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.263 align:middle line:84%
examination could check the
reflexes of the Achilles,

00:03:16.263 --> 00:03:19.399 align:middle line:84%
and take the little hammer, and
bounce it like in the old days.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:23.236 align:middle line:84%
And that's still very
clearly an indication of...

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.005 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So if you don't
have a lot of response

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:26.039 align:middle line:90%
that means low thyroid function?

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.107 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Low thyroid.

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:28.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.544 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So there's what's
called Hertoghe Syndrome,

00:03:30.544 --> 00:03:32.279 align:middle line:90%
the outer third of the eyebrows.

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:33.780 align:middle line:90%
They start to thin.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.283 align:middle line:84%
And I ask people, do you pluck
them, or is that naturally thin?

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:39.686 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they barely even
have an eyebrow barely forming.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.422 align:middle line:84%
Look in the mirror and you'll
see the difference in people.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:45.692 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Thierry Hertoghe, and
that's what it was named after,

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.328 align:middle line:84%
is -- really represents
my mentor who trained

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:51.398 align:middle line:84%
with three generations
of Hertoghe --

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.567 align:middle line:84%
the father, the father
before him, Luke Hertoghe --

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.504 align:middle line:84%
and they were endocrinologists,
and they were the first ones

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
to actually identify
deficiencies of thyroid.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.544 align:middle line:84%
So they discovered that
replacing thyroid hormones

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:09.983 align:middle line:84%
over 100 years ago would reverse
certain forms of myxedema

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:12.052 align:middle line:84%
which is severe fluid
retention...

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:13.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.421 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...and premature
aging, the skin, the body,

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:17.224 align:middle line:84%
the -- the face is
all puffed up.

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:20.694 align:middle line:84%
It would help reduce
the incidence of --

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.295 align:middle line:90%
of mental retardation.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:26.133 align:middle line:84%
It would help physical and
mental wellbeing, energy,

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:29.102 align:middle line:84%
and keeping the weight
under control.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.138 align:middle line:84%
And thermogenically, if you
have cold hands or feet.

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:34.141 align:middle line:84%
When I do my events I ask
people, "Please shake hands

00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:35.408 align:middle line:90%
with the person next to you."

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:38.245 align:middle line:84%
And I say, "Whoever's got the
coldest hands has the lowest

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:39.412 align:middle line:90%
thyroid level."

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:40.413 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Hmm.

00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:42.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So we
know that thyroid

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.153 align:middle line:84%
like other hormones affect
almost every function

00:04:46.153 --> 00:04:50.657 align:middle line:84%
of the body, but each hormone
has its specific ability.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:53.426 align:middle line:84%
So in the case of growth
hormone, or testosterone,

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:58.665 align:middle line:84%
or DHEA, melatonin, all of these
people have heard of, estrogen,

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:01.001 align:middle line:90%
of course, and testosterone.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:05.005 align:middle line:84%
What people don't realize is
these hormones do decline or,

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:09.976 align:middle line:84%
let's be clear, they either as
we age get too high or too low.

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.111 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So when
you say too high

00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.212 align:middle line:84%
that would automatically
indicate out of balance?

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:13.647 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:14.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Classically
in the case of estrogen.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.717 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:19.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Most
doctors are trained

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.122 align:middle line:84%
to measure what's
called E1, E2, E3.

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.157 align:middle line:84%
There's three forms of estrogen
they measure in the blood,

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:26.393 align:middle line:90%
estradiol, estriol, and estrone.

00:05:26.393 --> 00:05:30.130 align:middle line:84%
The problem is most doctors are
not aware there's 40 different

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.201 align:middle line:84%
estrogen metabolites, and that's
typically usually only measured

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.169 align:middle line:90%
in the urine.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Although, there's one
lab in the country I know

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.538 align:middle line:84%
of that will do a
blood test for...

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:39.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A lot of
them do saliva tests.

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:40.407 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't cut it?

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.241 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: That would
never measure the good

00:05:41.241 --> 00:05:43.376 align:middle line:90%
and bad estrogen.

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:45.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So is urine actually
the more appropriate test?

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:46.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Dr. Hertoghe
and many

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:49.049 align:middle line:84%
of the European doctors
are highly trained.

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Jonathan Wright, yes.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.119 align:middle line:90%
We prefer to do all three forms.

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.422 align:middle line:84%
We do -- we don't say that one's
more accurate than the other.

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:56.389 align:middle line:90%
They each have their benefits.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.524 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You combine
them, yes.

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.159 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So we do a
saliva test initially

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:00.493 align:middle line:84%
because it's the best
way to measure cortisol.

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.362 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Just 24-hour
saliva samples?

00:06:02.362 --> 00:06:03.196 align:middle line:90%
Or...

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.064 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: No, saliva...

00:06:04.064 --> 00:06:05.098 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...just one?

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:05.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: No, you
can do four samples.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:07.634 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Morning, midday,
afternoon, and evening.

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:09.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:06:09.102 --> 00:06:09.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And then you get
a curve, a diurnal curve...

00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:11.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:12.505 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...because
hormones change through the day.

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.108 align:middle line:84%
I love to have my clients
have these tests done

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.110 align:middle line:84%
with the doctors I work with
initially before they've started

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.648 align:middle line:84%
on any kind of bioidentical or
herbal intervention, homeopathic

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
or otherwise because saliva is
sensitive, but only to a degree.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.122 align:middle line:84%
Particularly it's best
for measuring cortisol

00:06:29.122 --> 00:06:31.524 align:middle line:90%
and DHA for adrenal function.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:32.659 align:middle line:90%
I would never want to ignore it

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.495 align:middle line:84%
because a blood test is
not a very accurate way

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:36.263 align:middle line:84%
to measure adrenal
function or...

00:06:36.263 --> 00:06:37.764 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:39.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...cortisol.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.534 align:middle line:84%
You could add a few binding
proteins, but I will say

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:44.371 align:middle line:84%
that the reason so many doctors
depend on blood tests is many

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
of the published studies
were done on blood tests,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.143 align:middle line:84%
and so they became very
accustomed, and there --

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:51.278 align:middle line:84%
saliva's a new entry
into the game...

00:06:51.278 --> 00:06:52.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:54.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...of
hormonal evaluation.

00:06:54.514 --> 00:06:58.451 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly 24 urine
test, aside from being able

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.255 align:middle line:84%
to collect it in the morning
to the next day, I tell people,

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.958 align:middle line:84%
"Listen," the doctor says, "Oh,
it's too difficult to get people

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:05.692 align:middle line:90%
to collect for 24 hours."

00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:06.393 align:middle line:84%
Well, you have to
urinate anyway.

00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:08.194 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:09.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You have
to go to the restroom.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.363 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Carry the
little cup [laughter].

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:11.498 align:middle line:84%
D Carry the cup, and
it's not a little cup.

00:07:11.498 --> 00:07:12.966 align:middle line:84%
It's you know take your
container, and the bag,

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.135 align:middle line:84%
or the -- or-- or
you know the...

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:17.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Do you do
it in different cups?

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:18.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: No, it's all one...

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:18.972 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Or does it
come -- a combination?

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:19.439 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...big container.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:21.408 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And then you pour
it off to a little container...

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:22.442 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...send
it off to the lab.

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.078 align:middle line:84%
And within three weeks we get
a breakdown of the cortisol

00:07:25.078 --> 00:07:26.546 align:middle line:84%
and all its metabolites,
the estrogen

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:27.981 align:middle line:90%
and multiple metabolites.

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.517 align:middle line:84%
When I say metabolites of
testosterone

00:07:30.517 --> 00:07:32.085 align:middle line:90%
or cortisol or thyroid,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.389 align:middle line:84%
that exert a far more
potent effect on the body.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:39.125 align:middle line:84%
They could very well be, in
the case of say estrogen,

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.161 align:middle line:84%
what I call 16 alpha
hydroxyestrone,

00:07:41.161 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
the one that we know is
identified to be present

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:84%
at high levels in women who
tend to have breast cancer,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.301 align:middle line:84%
or tend to develop
ovarian cancer,

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:52.305 align:middle line:84%
or uterine cysts, or
fibroids, or acne.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:53.540 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting because most

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.311 align:middle line:84%
of this dysbiosises were
imbalances due to xenoestrogens,

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.613 align:middle line:84%
when drinking
bottled water from plastic.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:01.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:02.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Pesticide exposure;

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.951 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately our whole
generation's been exposed

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:08.655 align:middle line:84%
to generations of using
pesticides in our fields.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.190 align:middle line:84%
You know when they say organic
how do you know it hasn't

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.193 align:middle line:84%
leeched into the underwater
table in the ground?

00:08:13.193 --> 00:08:14.361 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:16.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So we -- we
go further, and we realize

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:19.265 align:middle line:84%
that there is a good form of
estrogen within the metabolites,

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:23.503 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's metabolized;
it exerts a safe effect;

00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:25.205 align:middle line:84%
it actually does what
we call apoptosis,

00:08:25.205 --> 00:08:29.442 align:middle line:84%
it stimulates your cells to
look for abnormal cancer cells.

00:08:29.442 --> 00:08:33.246 align:middle line:84%
It's been shown that this
good form of estrogen along

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:36.616 align:middle line:84%
with estriol which is
a weaker form of one

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:39.986 align:middle line:84%
of the primary estrogens
exerts a very positive effect

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:43.289 align:middle line:84%
in prevention, or it's typically
found at a higher ratio..

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.993 align:middle line:84%
Estriol's a three to one, to the
more potent estrogens.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.027 align:middle line:90%
And we find in young people

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.996 align:middle line:84%
who are not using
birth control pills --

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.264 align:middle line:84%
because birth control
pills are synthetic;

00:08:51.264 --> 00:08:53.299 align:middle line:90%
they come from horse urine;

00:08:53.299 --> 00:08:56.603 align:middle line:84%
and they don't even care whether
it's male or female horse.

00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:57.404 align:middle line:90%
Listen to me closely...

00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:58.071 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, goodness.

00:08:58.071 --> 00:08:59.372 align:middle line:90%
Are you serious?

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:02.442 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...China 3,00 years
ago actually would take the

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:05.211 align:middle line:84%
urine from young
women ages 15 to 22;

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:08.948 align:middle line:84%
they would concentrate the
urine, get all the hormones,

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.383 align:middle line:90%
over 100 hormones --

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.253 align:middle line:84%
and in China they knew 3,000
years ago how to optimize.

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:14.487 align:middle line:84%
They would take those
hormones and give them

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:18.491 align:middle line:84%
to the senior women in that
culture and reverse aging.

00:09:18.491 --> 00:09:21.661 align:middle line:84%
The men -- listen to
me closely -- would --

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:26.099 align:middle line:84%
they would extract urine
from young men 15 to 22,

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:28.101 align:middle line:84%
concentrate all the male
hormones along with the mixes

00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:31.371 align:middle line:84%
because there's a little bit of
female hormone in the male mix,

00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:35.375 align:middle line:84%
and growth hormone, EPO, all
these exotic, important hormones

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:38.645 align:middle line:84%
that promote longevity and
health, and they gave it

00:09:38.645 --> 00:09:40.113 align:middle line:84%
to the senior men of
that culture to...

00:09:40.113 --> 00:09:41.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:42.649 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...reverse aging.

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:43.750 align:middle line:90%
They knew this 3,000 years ago.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.752 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Interesting,
okay, now you've opened

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.253 align:middle line:90%
up so many topics just in that.

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.389 align:middle line:90%
Now one of them you --

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.624 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned a little bit
ago is our adrenal function.

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:55.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I bring that up
because it seems as though a lot

00:09:55.128 --> 00:09:59.165 align:middle line:84%
of people who end up on thyroid
medications often have adrenal,

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:03.136 align:middle line:84%
or adrenal seems to somehow be
paired with thyroid function.

00:10:03.136 --> 00:10:04.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: True.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:05.538 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Can you comment on
that and what's going on there?

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:06.372 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:10:06.372 --> 00:10:07.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The relationship

00:10:07.407 --> 00:10:08.408 align:middle line:84%
between cortisol and
thyroid function.

00:10:08.408 --> 00:10:10.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: There
-- there's a group

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:13.146 align:middle line:84%
of well-trained anti-aging
practitioners that's growing

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:14.247 align:middle line:84%
through the American Academy
of Anti-Aging Medicine,

00:10:14.247 --> 00:10:16.683 align:middle line:84%
a nonprofit organization
of which

00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:20.053 align:middle line:84%
by the way I conduct a
forum for 26,000 physicians

00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:23.556 align:middle line:84%
around the world that read my
-- my blogs and answers

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.558 align:middle line:90%
and articles and -- and videos.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:29.696 align:middle line:84%
And with that the -- the
doctors in this field recognize

00:10:29.696 --> 00:10:33.566 align:middle line:84%
that adrenal dysfunction
which is often -- the --

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:35.301 align:middle line:84%
the chronic system
is chronic fatigue --

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:42.075 align:middle line:84%
it could be you crave sugars
or salts; you eat excessively.

00:10:42.075 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
You eat a plate of
food, and you think

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.212 align:middle line:84%
by all standards
you should be full.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:47.447 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's filling
up your stomach,

00:10:47.447 --> 00:10:49.148 align:middle line:90%
but you're still hungry.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I have that problem
myself; I know.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.654 align:middle line:84%
So these people then
eat -- they'll overeat.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.189 align:middle line:90%
They'll eat to the point

00:10:56.189 --> 00:10:58.324 align:middle line:84%
where their body can't even
take any more food

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.559 align:middle line:90%
into their stomach,

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:02.662 align:middle line:84%
and it finally releases
some cortisol indirectly.

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.098 align:middle line:84%
And see, without
cortisol you would die

00:11:05.098 --> 00:11:06.533 align:middle line:90%
within minutes, within hours.

00:11:06.533 --> 00:11:08.401 align:middle line:90%
So the body must have it.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:13.406 align:middle line:84%
So this is the source of
addictions to alcohol, drugs;

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:16.376 align:middle line:84%
it could be a sexual addiction;
it could be a food addiction.

00:11:16.376 --> 00:11:19.512 align:middle line:84%
These addictions often
are caused by cortisol

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:20.446 align:middle line:90%
or adrenal deficiencies.

00:11:20.446 --> 00:11:22.715 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jackson's
a good example.

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:28.021 align:middle line:84%
He had extremely low adrenal
function, hypercortisolemia.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:29.722 align:middle line:84%
You could see just
the model look.

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:33.026 align:middle line:84%
You know how -- the
sunken-in look?

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.027 align:middle line:90%
You see that in people.

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:35.662 align:middle line:90%
He's very skinny and thin.

00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:39.032 align:middle line:84%
And these people are not
necessarily overweight,

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.067 align:middle line:84%
but what happens is they're
searching for something

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.436 align:middle line:84%
to release cortisol, so in
his case it was the excitement

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.471 align:middle line:84%
of being out entertaining,
right?

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.706 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: To get that release?

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:47.707 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes!

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:48.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yet he
didn't have enough

00:11:48.575 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:90%
to really release to begin with.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: So what did he do?

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:55.081 align:middle line:84%
He depended on massive
amounts of Coca-Cola

00:11:55.081 --> 00:11:57.283 align:middle line:90%
and caffeine-rich beverages.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:11:58.251 --> 00:11:59.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: He drank
massive amounts.

00:11:59.452 --> 00:12:01.287 align:middle line:84%
It's well known after
his autopsy his heart was

00:12:01.287 --> 00:12:03.423 align:middle line:90%
perfectly healthy.

00:12:03.423 --> 00:12:07.226 align:middle line:84%
The doctor that took his life
was only assisting Michael

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:10.263 align:middle line:84%
to get to sleep because
Michael begged him every night,

00:12:10.263 --> 00:12:11.497 align:middle line:90%
"I can't get to sleep."

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.266 align:middle line:84%
He drank coffee all day,
the equivalent of Coca-Cola.

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:16.135 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of milligrams
of caffeine.

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:17.136 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Whoa,
thousands of milligrams.

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And that's
why he died.

00:12:18.004 --> 00:12:19.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I understand that.

00:12:19.005 --> 00:12:20.239 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Well,
let's say hundreds.

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.007 align:middle line:90%
I...

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:22.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:22.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: It would
border on 1,000 milligrams.

00:12:22.609 --> 00:12:23.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:24.377 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: 200 milligrams
is a drug dose.

00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:25.445 align:middle line:90%
One cup of coffee,

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:28.214 align:middle line:84%
100 milligrams is what
a doctor prescribes

00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:30.183 align:middle line:90%
to get a drug reaction

00:12:30.183 --> 00:12:31.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, my God.

00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:32.518 align:middle line:84%
Well, I understand this
pretty well because I was born

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:34.687 align:middle line:84%
without the ability
to create cortisol.

00:12:34.687 --> 00:12:37.323 align:middle line:84%
I create almost none, like
less than a baseline level.

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.725 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: My entire life, and
I've learned about these things

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:45.131 align:middle line:84%
and the temptation was always
to go for -- for coffee or...

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.132 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Sure.

00:12:46.132 --> 00:12:46.566 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...sweets,
or something.

00:12:46.566 --> 00:12:47.767 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:48.434 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And I've learned
how to modulate that.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.669 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:12:49.669 --> 00:12:50.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But I also have
to take hydrocortisone just

00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:51.704 align:middle line:84%
to survive, just to
get by day to day.

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.339 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: There's
a new alternative.

00:12:53.339 --> 00:12:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, I'd
like to know about that.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.376 align:middle line:90%
I would like to know about that.

00:12:56.376 --> 00:12:58.778 align:middle line:84%
So what is it for not must
myself but other people?

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.747 align:middle line:84%
This is a unique
situation; we get that.

00:13:00.747 --> 00:13:02.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Sure.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:02.982 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But a lot of
people are adrenal fatigued

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:04.283 align:middle line:90%
and would like to know as well.

00:13:04.283 --> 00:13:06.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Addison's
disease is the most...

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:06.986 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's what I have.

00:13:06.986 --> 00:13:08.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...extremist form.

00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.355 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:10.123 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Consider
that President Kennedy...

00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.058 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: His physician knew,

00:13:12.058 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
and what an incredible
opportunity for him

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.429 align:middle line:84%
because if his doctor hadn't
known I truly believe history

00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.698 align:middle line:84%
would have been altered
because he wouldn't have been

00:13:18.698 --> 00:13:20.199 align:middle line:90%
our President.

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:22.135 align:middle line:84%
He couldn't have functioned
without proper hydrocortisone.

00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.336 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:24.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: He was on regular
hydrocortisone therapy.

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:28.641 align:middle line:84%
He also had extreme back pain
which -- you see cortisone,

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.010 align:middle line:84%
which the original
book was written

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.145 align:middle line:90%
by William McKinley Jefferies,

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.280 align:middle line:84%
stated as Safe Uses
of Cortisone.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.551 align:middle line:84%
And he was a Virginia
professor, very well read,

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:40.219 align:middle line:84%
and he identified this
-- this condition.

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:41.254 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: William
McKinley what?

00:13:41.254 --> 00:13:43.022 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Jefferies.

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:43.589 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Jefferies, okay.

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:44.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: And you see,

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:46.426 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jefferies had
reviewed the literature.

00:13:46.426 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:90%
In fact the Nobel Prize

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.663 align:middle line:84%
around the 1950s was
awarded for the discovery...

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:51.531 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I know, yes.

00:13:51.531 --> 00:13:52.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...of cortisone...

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.165 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.133 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...because
it was a cure

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:55.301 align:middle line:84%
for arthritis, although
temporary.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:56.402 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:57.804 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: The drug
companies saw this,

00:13:57.804 --> 00:14:00.206 align:middle line:84%
realized it was a multi-billion
dollar industry, so they went

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:03.376 align:middle line:84%
about and created synthetic
versions of prednisone,

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:06.379 align:middle line:90%
and these synthetic versions --

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.247 align:middle line:84%
for example, the body only
produces 30 to 40 milligrams

00:14:08.247 --> 00:14:10.650 align:middle line:90%
of -- of hydrocortisone a day.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.518 align:middle line:90%
That's what it needs to survive.

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
So they'd give them
five to 10, or 20,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.522 align:middle line:90%
or 40 milligrams of prednisone.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.991 align:middle line:84%
The problem is it has
a short half-life.

00:14:18.991 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:84%
In normal hydrocortisone it --
it -- it's released in the body

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.429 align:middle line:84%
and dissipates within
three hours.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.498 align:middle line:84%
But prednisone can
linger for days.

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:28.234 align:middle line:84%
It stays in the system and
exerts too powerful an effect,

00:14:28.234 --> 00:14:30.136 align:middle line:90%
so you get these moon-faced.

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:33.106 align:middle line:84%
You'd get people becoming
obese with prednisone.

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:35.408 align:middle line:84%
It would cause dysfunction
and death.

00:14:35.408 --> 00:14:37.276 align:middle line:84%
So the people got
fearful of hydrocortisone.

00:14:37.276 --> 00:14:40.413 align:middle line:84%
So William McKinley
Jefferies rewrote his book,

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:42.115 align:middle line:90%
and he changed the title.

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:43.249 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What was it?

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: He said,
 Safe Uses of Cortisol.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.286 align:middle line:84%
And you see because cortisol was
different than hydrocortisone

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:50.189 align:middle line:84%
because cortisone, by
the way, could be thought

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:53.259 align:middle line:84%
of as prednisone and the
synthetic derivatives.

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Not good.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.028 align:middle line:84%
I know the difference
between the two because I...

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.029 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:14:57.029 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...suffered
at the hand

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.031 align:middle line:84%
of doctors putting
me on prednisone.

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:00.199 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So about
four years ago --

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:03.369 align:middle line:84%
prior to that I had
really studied

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:05.104 align:middle line:84%
with the world experts
Dr. Thierry Hertoghe,

00:15:05.104 --> 00:15:10.176 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Ron Rothberg, UC San Diego
professor, and we discovered

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:13.279 align:middle line:84%
that from years before we could
measure urine, blood, and saliva

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:18.251 align:middle line:84%
and monitor changes in
cortisol, diurnal changes,

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:21.354 align:middle line:84%
and we could substitute
using natural low-dosage

00:15:21.354 --> 00:15:22.655 align:middle line:90%
of hydrocortisone.

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:26.225 align:middle line:84%
We also found that the sun
exerts 50,000 lux of energy,

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:28.528 align:middle line:84%
and every time you get
outdoors in the sun

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:31.097 align:middle line:84%
without sunglasses
because your eyes...

00:15:31.097 --> 00:15:32.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:15:32.198 --> 00:15:33.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...have to
have the pineal gland

00:15:33.165 --> 00:15:34.767 align:middle line:84%
and stimulate LH-luteinizing
hormone

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.435 align:middle line:90%
for testosterone and cortisol.

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:37.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is the first
time I've heard that --

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:40.439 align:middle line:84%
its impact on cortisol
production.

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:41.307 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Tremendous impact.

00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:42.308 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: This is amazing.

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:43.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I get outdoors.

00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:46.312 align:middle line:84%
I work out every morning
outdoors without my shirt on,

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:49.549 align:middle line:84%
and as I lift weights
the sun is on my body...

00:15:49.549 --> 00:15:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, and...

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...at
sunrise or sunset.

00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:53.019 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...you do
it in cool weather.

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You're really big on
exercising in cool weather.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:54.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You don't
want to overheat

00:15:54.587 --> 00:15:55.354 align:middle line:90%
when you're working out.

00:15:55.354 --> 00:15:56.155 align:middle line:90%
You must keep cool...

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:56.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The hot yoga.

00:15:56.756 --> 00:15:57.523 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...conditions.

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:58.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What's hot...

00:15:58.558 --> 00:15:59.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know
it might help people

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:00.560 align:middle line:90%
to stretch a little better.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.095 align:middle line:84%
You know I -- so long as
there's a large amount of water.

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.197 align:middle line:84%
I mean, dehydration's
a serious risk.

00:16:04.197 --> 00:16:06.632 align:middle line:84%
You've heard about
these people dying

00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.267 align:middle line:90%
in those tents in -- in Arizona.

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, yes.

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:10.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And you know
the moment you're --

00:16:10.503 --> 00:16:11.971 align:middle line:84%
you're depleted of water
-- I mean, we're --

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:13.973 align:middle line:84%
we're like sacks of water
that should have been

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.643 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...and you know as
we're born we have about 70,

00:16:17.643 --> 00:16:20.980 align:middle line:84%
80% water, and as we get older
we shrink down like a prune

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.082 align:middle line:90%
to -- to 50, 60% water.

00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:24.383 align:middle line:84%
Our brain shrinks
down and everything.

00:16:24.383 --> 00:16:27.119 align:middle line:84%
We must sustain -- and sustain
large amounts of water to...

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay, so I didn't...

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.988 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...be
young and healthy.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:29.522 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, and thank you.

00:16:29.522 --> 00:16:30.389 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't...

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:31.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: And wrinkle-free.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.458 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, and
wrinkle-free.

00:16:32.458 --> 00:16:33.659 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't mean to
sidetrack you on that

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.994 align:middle line:84%
because you were talking
about cortisol production.

00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.996 align:middle line:84%
You're exercising in the
morning, in the sun...

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:39.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...in the cool
air, fresh air, outdoors.

00:16:39.031 --> 00:16:40.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes, yeah.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that actually
stimulates cortisol production?

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Tremendous
natural release.

00:16:43.236 --> 00:16:44.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So for a
person who has no --

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.539 align:middle line:90%
natural, normal kind of --

00:16:46.539 --> 00:16:48.407 align:middle line:84%
somewhat normal adrenal
function,

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:52.144 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people don't
anymore, but relatively normal,

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:54.280 align:middle line:84%
they can just by doing
that alone start the day

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.149 align:middle line:84%
by increasing their
cortisol function?

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:57.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:16:58.751 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Amazing.

00:16:58.751 --> 00:16:59.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know
Regina think about it.

00:16:59.518 --> 00:17:00.186 align:middle line:90%
People love to vacation.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:00.720 align:middle line:90%
Where do they go?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.954 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The sun.

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:02.388 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: They go to Hawaii.

00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:03.656 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:17:03.656 --> 00:17:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: They go to the
Caribbean, and they're outdoors.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.659 align:middle line:84%
You know they're -- they're
white, and they get a tan.

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:08.127 align:middle line:90%
It's not about the tan.

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It's about the sun stimulating
the body and the adrenals

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.232 align:middle line:84%
to release this natural cortisol
that they so desperately need,

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.367 align:middle line:90%
and they feel wonderful.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:16.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, by the time
they get home it's, "Oh, my God.

00:17:16.636 --> 00:17:19.372 align:middle line:84%
Why can't we quit our lives
and live like this forever?"

00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.539 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:21.406 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Yes, and you
know the number one cause

00:17:21.406 --> 00:17:23.409 align:middle line:90%
of sick days in our culture?

00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:24.377 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Lack of light?

00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:25.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Low cortisol.

00:17:25.243 --> 00:17:26.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Low cortisol, yeah.

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:28.079 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And these
people, they develop flus,

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:28.513 align:middle line:90%
colds, and bronchitis.

00:17:28.513 --> 00:17:30.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:17:30.016 --> 00:17:31.083 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: And the solution,

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:32.251 align:middle line:84%
according to William
McKinley Jefferies

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and you read his book
 Safe Uses of Cortisole,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.388 align:middle line:84%
and in my book  Grow
Young and Slim --

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:39.392 align:middle line:84%
I also alluded to it in my
other book  Stay Young --

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:43.629 align:middle line:84%
and that is that the body can
benefit from certain herbs.

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:47.233 align:middle line:84%
I've assembled a certain
group of herbs, ashwagandha.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:48.534 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.703 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: We know that the
use of -- of garlic, and --

00:17:50.703 --> 00:17:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and adrenal cortex, and
luteum which targets LH and --

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:01.314 align:middle line:84%
that is RNA and DNA
viruses, cherry extract.

00:18:01.314 --> 00:18:04.183 align:middle line:84%
There's a number of
wonderful things.

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.352 align:middle line:90%
Caprylic acid targets candida.

00:18:06.352 --> 00:18:09.388 align:middle line:84%
I like to use polycosanol
that stimulates the --

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:12.725 align:middle line:84%
the strength of the body
and lowers LDL cholesterol

00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:14.226 align:middle line:90%
and improves muscle density.

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:16.095 align:middle line:84%
You know as we age one of the
risks is loss of muscle density

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:19.432 align:middle line:84%
and -- and human frailty
and respiratory distress.

00:18:19.432 --> 00:18:20.967 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:22.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: If you lose too
much weight, and some people go

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.002 align:middle line:84%
on a vegetarian diet,
and they think, "Oh,

00:18:23.002 --> 00:18:24.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing the right thing."

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:25.504 align:middle line:84%
And they're eating a lot
of salads, and vegetables,

00:18:25.504 --> 00:18:27.974 align:middle line:84%
and some fruit, and they
don't understand the food

00:18:27.974 --> 00:18:29.075 align:middle line:90%
density requirement.

00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:31.110 align:middle line:84%
And as I eat a very
rich plant-based diet

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.245 align:middle line:90%
for 35 years I know.

00:18:33.245 --> 00:18:36.549 align:middle line:84%
I take in large quantities
of food, four to eight pounds

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:84%
of raw fruits and
vegetables a day.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.252 align:middle line:84%
I eat cooked brown
rice when I do eat...

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:41.287 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:18:41.287 --> 00:18:42.421 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...or
cooked beans or peas.

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.423 align:middle line:84%
And I -- I add avocado,
soaked nuts and seeds.

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:46.125 align:middle line:84%
So I get a large amount
of natural calories

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.494 align:middle line:90%
to sustain my daily activity.

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.229 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to lose
my muscle density.

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You can't fast
and burn up your body tissue.

00:18:53.265 --> 00:18:56.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it's important
to note at this time that you --

00:18:56.102 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:84%
you're a champion in
strength and endurance on --

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.708 align:middle line:84%
on a global level here, and
you've done this on this diet.

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:07.613 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're loading
up on heavy proteins, per se.

00:19:07.613 --> 00:19:09.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: No, I
get my proteins

00:19:09.115 --> 00:19:10.483 align:middle line:90%
from my favorite source.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:11.217 align:middle line:90%
You want to know what it is?

00:19:11.217 --> 00:19:12.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, please.

00:19:12.184 --> 00:19:13.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Sweet
potatoes, yams,

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:14.220 align:middle line:84%
and all the varieties
that come about.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.622 align:middle line:84%
The purple sweet
potatoes in Okinawa,

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:18.491 align:middle line:84%
the longest-lived
people in the world.

00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:19.992 align:middle line:84%
They eat a lot of
purple sweet potatoes.

00:19:19.992 --> 00:19:20.960 align:middle line:90%
They eat oranges.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.661 align:middle line:84%
They eat fish only
twice a month.

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:25.197 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize they're
not eating heavy amounts of --

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle line:84%
of animal or any
fish-based product.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:84%
So my program that I use with
Simply Healthy is gluten-free,

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:35.741 align:middle line:84%
dairy-free, soy-free, and
oil-free, but not fat free.

00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:38.677 align:middle line:84%
See, we use whole, natural
complex fats because you need...

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:40.112 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Good.

00:19:40.112 --> 00:19:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...the fiber and
the essential fatty acids.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:41.981 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I can't
function without fats.

00:19:41.981 --> 00:19:42.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Absolutely.

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:43.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, I've tried it.

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:44.116 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't work.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Doesn't work,

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.285 align:middle line:84%
and you wouldn't get enough
calories without which.

00:19:46.285 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:90%
So I think that when we come

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.257 align:middle line:84%
around full circle
cortisol works

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:52.324 align:middle line:90%
like an orchestra with thyroid.

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:56.262 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid's anabolic;
cortisol is catabolic.

00:19:56.262 --> 00:19:58.998 align:middle line:84%
So think of two kids on a
teeter-totter, and you have

00:19:58.998 --> 00:20:00.299 align:middle line:90%
to keep them balanced.

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:01.333 align:middle line:84%
So if cortisol is supported all
of a sudden the anabolic part,

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.636 align:middle line:90%
thyroid starts to drop.

00:20:03.636 --> 00:20:06.238 align:middle line:84%
And you can cause imbalances
by using just cortisol therapy.

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:10.509 align:middle line:84%
So I have found that it takes
about six months to a year

00:20:10.509 --> 00:20:12.111 align:middle line:84%
with getting to bed
a little earlier

00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:14.313 align:middle line:84%
because the peak hormones are
produced from about 9 o'clock

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:17.483 align:middle line:84%
at night 'til about
4:00 in the morning.

00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Don't push yourself through the
night to finish that project

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.221 align:middle line:90%
and then exhaust your hormones.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Get to bed early; wake
up a little bit earlier.

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.659 align:middle line:90%
Go outdoors in the daylight.

00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:28.194 align:middle line:84%
Work in the daylight
if you can.

00:20:28.194 --> 00:20:29.428 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, yes.

00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:30.463 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: All these
things are going to help.

00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:32.264 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid, though,
has to be supported.

00:20:32.264 --> 00:20:33.699 align:middle line:90%
And so we support the thyroid.

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:36.368 align:middle line:84%
Fresh fruit improves
thyroid function.

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.671 align:middle line:84%
The warm weather
improves thyroid function.

00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:40.172 align:middle line:90%
The sun, again.

00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:43.709 align:middle line:84%
So we looked at the foods that I
like to recommend, but sometimes

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:46.712 align:middle line:84%
if the thyroid's too
low we need iodine.

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:49.315 align:middle line:84%
2 billion people in the
world are iodine deficient.

00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:50.316 align:middle line:84%
And now with Fukushima,
the biggest...

00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:52.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, right.

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:54.253 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...risk in
history to all of mankind.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:59.058 align:middle line:84%
And now we know that much of the
floor shellfish are dying off.

00:20:59.058 --> 00:21:00.226 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:02.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Many of the
important sea animals are dying.

00:21:02.528 --> 00:21:06.265 align:middle line:84%
And if we eat those
animals, shellfish or fish,

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:09.168 align:middle line:84%
when those particles concentrate
in our body we don't even have

00:21:09.168 --> 00:21:11.237 align:middle line:84%
to be within 20 feet
of Fukushima.

00:21:11.237 --> 00:21:12.538 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You bet.

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Those particles
are permanently in our body.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so Dr. Patrick
Flannigan, he's really big

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:18.377 align:middle line:90%
on the iodine as well.

00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:19.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:21:19.245 --> 00:21:20.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And he was explaining

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:84%
to me his favorite
combination is --

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.414 align:middle line:84%
and I want to get
your take on this...

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:23.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and
find out yours --

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.185 align:middle line:84%
is to use a substance
called Ioridol for --

00:21:26.185 --> 00:21:29.355 align:middle line:84%
Ioridol,which is
potassium chloride,

00:21:29.355 --> 00:21:34.293 align:middle line:84%
and then also nascent iodine
together for a balanced effect.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.562 align:middle line:90%
That's his particular protocol.

00:21:36.562 --> 00:21:37.530 align:middle line:90%
What do you feel about that?

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And what is your
particular protocol?

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: After...

00:21:39.198 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Do you use kelp, or?

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Yeah, after
extensive review and access

00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:47.306 align:middle line:84%
to probably what I would say is
without a doubt the originators

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.308 align:middle line:84%
of the whole concept of how do
we develop a thyroid deficiency,

00:21:49.308 --> 00:21:54.180 align:middle line:90%
but how do we treat it?

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.314 align:middle line:90%
You need T1, T2, T3, T4.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.549 align:middle line:84%
T1 and T2 is iodine,
which potassium iodine --

00:21:56.549 --> 00:22:00.719 align:middle line:84%
not microgram dosages, but
as you mentioned Patrick...

00:22:00.719 --> 00:22:02.154 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.455 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...you're going
to need milligram dosages.

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:06.425 align:middle line:84%
You see the people who survived
Hiroshima were eating large

00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:07.526 align:middle line:90%
amounts of kelp and...

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:08.394 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:09.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...and miso soup.

00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:12.231 align:middle line:84%
And they were getting on average
of 10 to 20 milligrams of --

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:14.400 align:middle line:90%
milligrams of iodine a day.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.234 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:15.234 --> 00:22:16.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: So in -- in a --

00:22:16.368 --> 00:22:18.270 align:middle line:84%
I created a capsule
called rad iodine that has

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.706 align:middle line:90%
about 20 to 30 milligrams.

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:23.409 align:middle line:84%
In -- in this case 30
milligrams per capsule.

00:22:23.409 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm creating...

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.644 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And is
it 1, 2, 3, and 4?

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:27.646 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Yes, it has
tyrosine, which is the T1

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.381 align:middle line:90%
and the T2, the iodine;

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:33.118 align:middle line:84%
and T3 and T4 is not
within that product.

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:36.288 align:middle line:84%
Another one that's -- that's
available, usually prescription,

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:39.658 align:middle line:84%
westhroid, or you can
compound T3, T4 and not have

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:42.294 align:middle line:84%
to use the -- the normal
derivatives of pig or cow,

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.663 align:middle line:90%
and that can be compounded.

00:22:44.663 --> 00:22:46.298 align:middle line:84%
It's the allergic-producing
as well.

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:47.299 align:middle line:90%
It's very pure.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
really good to know.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So it's called rad iodine
that you've had compiled?

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.171 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:53.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Because also --

00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:54.273 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I follow the
radiation maps as well.

00:22:54.273 --> 00:22:55.541 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean, we're
looking at airborne radiation...

00:22:56.342 --> 00:22:57.509 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Unbelievable.

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.444 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...fish --
consumption through fish.

00:22:58.444 --> 00:22:59.712 align:middle line:90%
Our waters are contaminated.

00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:02.248 align:middle line:84%
The coasts of Canada
and California,

00:23:02.248 --> 00:23:04.283 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to South
America is contaminated,

00:23:04.283 --> 00:23:06.252 align:middle line:84%
and we have to deal with
the fact we're now living

00:23:06.252 --> 00:23:09.655 align:middle line:84%
in a radiation-rich environment,
and there are some elements

00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:11.223 align:middle line:84%
in there that shouldn't be
in there in addition to that.

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:15.527 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm hearing from
you and virtually all

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:17.997 align:middle line:84%
of the others involved
in that area of research,

00:23:17.997 --> 00:23:19.265 align:middle line:84%
we have to have iodine
supplementation now.

00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:21.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: It's a must.

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.402 align:middle line:84%
Our children, our seniors
are the most susceptible.

00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:25.004 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Everyone, yes.

00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:27.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Everyone, and since
everyone's basically deficient

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:29.675 align:middle line:84%
due to bromide in breads
which depletes your iodine.

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: It used to
be iodine in breads.

00:23:31.443 --> 00:23:32.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:34.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: There's
virtually no good source.

00:23:34.013 --> 00:23:35.281 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Susie Schuter
said she does a

00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:38.117 align:middle line:84%
spectroanlysis on all her
clients and her patients,

00:23:38.117 --> 00:23:40.286 align:middle line:84%
and now recently she's
seen this in alarming rate

00:23:40.286 --> 00:23:42.554 align:middle line:84%
of people exposed
with excessive amounts

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:44.657 align:middle line:90%
of cesium, radioactive iodine.

00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:48.193 align:middle line:84%
They have radioactive particles
in their body now as we speak.

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:49.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:52.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Dr. Emil
Schandl is doing a test

00:23:52.031 --> 00:23:54.800 align:middle line:84%
for I think it's only about
$20 or so, and it'll measure

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.570 align:middle line:84%
for a urine test and pick up
how much radioactive iodine --

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.140 align:middle line:84%
not just radioactive iodine,
but cesium and all kinds

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.110 align:middle line:84%
of other heavy metal or --
that is radioactive particles.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.346 align:middle line:84%
So we -- we have to
take this seriously now

00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:09.114 align:middle line:84%
because Fukushima has
not been shut down yet.

00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:10.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, it's just --

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:12.351 align:middle line:84%
they just took some
of those core pieces

00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:13.519 align:middle line:84%
out of reactor number
four yesterday,

00:24:13.519 --> 00:24:16.121 align:middle line:84%
and there's some really
nasty stuff under there...

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.156 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:24:17.156 --> 00:24:18.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...that
shouldn't be there.

00:24:18.424 --> 00:24:19.258 align:middle line:84%
So the fact is this is not
going to end anytime soon.

00:24:19.258 --> 00:24:20.292 align:middle line:90%
We are going to -- all --

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:22.628 align:middle line:84%
the whole planet is
going to be exposed

00:24:22.628 --> 00:24:24.129 align:middle line:90%
to radiation. Everywhere.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Probably close
to a million people died due

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:27.299 align:middle line:84%
to Chernobyl and
the aftereffects.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.434 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:24:28.434 --> 00:24:29.768 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And we're
probably going to see --

00:24:29.768 --> 00:24:31.603 align:middle line:90%
I hate to predict how much more.

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:33.172 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
far worse than that.

00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:34.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Far worse.

00:24:34.273 --> 00:24:35.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I'm -- I'm
taking the steps now

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:37.509 align:middle line:90%
of a protective zeolite.

00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:38.577 align:middle line:90%
I use all -- I use...

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:39.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
what they all...

00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:40.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:41.113 align:middle line:90%
I use spa.

00:24:41.113 --> 00:24:42.047 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...all
the others are using.

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:43.349 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I use baking soda.

00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:44.416 align:middle line:84%
I've created some formulas that
will be released in a few --

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:48.053 align:middle line:84%
few months, but cell
stabilizer which helps

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:51.557 align:middle line:84%
to not only help estrogen
metabolism by the way,

00:24:51.557 --> 00:24:53.692 align:middle line:84%
which is back to our original
subject of hormones...

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:55.327 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're going to go
back to that in a minute, yeah.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...but it --

00:24:56.395 --> 00:24:59.164 align:middle line:84%
it really has been
proven with the B-17

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:00.366 align:middle line:90%
that you know apricot seed.

00:25:00.366 --> 00:25:01.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's some
things that people will say,

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.335 align:middle line:90%
"Well, it's questionable."

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Lay a trail.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.004 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: But -- but it --
you know the science is good.

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.306 align:middle line:84%
And -- and we see that
these things can help.

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:11.110 align:middle line:84%
I believe truly, like Bruce
Lipton, one of your guests...

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:12.111 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:13.212 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...that
the body depends

00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:14.546 align:middle line:90%
on what we call epigenetics.

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:15.547 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:16.548 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And he
clearly identified

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:18.083 align:middle line:90%
that you could take a cell --

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.352 align:middle line:84%
and by the way every day of the
week I look at people's blood

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.621 align:middle line:84%
under a microscope, under
high-power microscopes,

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:26.558 align:middle line:84%
so I see changes and transitions
over the last 35 years,

00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:30.129 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you this,
that epigenetics is real.

00:25:30.129 --> 00:25:32.297 align:middle line:84%
When you remove the nucleus
of a cell the cell continues

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:35.267 align:middle line:84%
to survive and function
like a digestive cell,

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:37.436 align:middle line:84%
or a respiratory cell,
or a muscle cell,

00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:41.006 align:middle line:84%
and because it just has its
internal understanding...

00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:41.774 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: There's
an intelligence...

00:25:41.774 --> 00:25:43.008 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes, yes.

00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:44.143 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...that
goes beyond that, yes.

00:25:44.143 --> 00:25:45.711 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So what we
surround ourselves with,

00:25:45.711 --> 00:25:47.279 align:middle line:84%
and the nutrients we take
in, the air we breathe,

00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:49.548 align:middle line:90%
the purity of the water.

00:25:49.548 --> 00:25:51.717 align:middle line:84%
I advocate using
hydroponic food.

00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:53.118 align:middle line:90%
That may be the best solution...

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:54.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, I agree.

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...because you can
cover the food, the fruits,

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:57.055 align:middle line:90%
the vegetables, tomatoes.

00:25:57.055 --> 00:25:59.158 align:middle line:84%
You can grow everything and
not have these particles

00:25:59.158 --> 00:26:00.459 align:middle line:90%
which is in our airstream now.

00:26:00.459 --> 00:26:02.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, and we have
chemtrails on top of that,

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:03.195 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:04.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:26:04.163 --> 00:26:05.063 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we
won't even go there.

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.165 align:middle line:90%
I've done shows on that.

00:26:06.165 --> 00:26:08.967 align:middle line:84%
But how does the
interaction with the sun work

00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:10.969 align:middle line:84%
when you have
hydroponically-grown fruit?

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:12.304 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: It's
fine; it's fine.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.272 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Because you're not
going to get the full spectrum

00:26:13.272 --> 00:26:14.339 align:middle line:84%
of information from
the sun, but...

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:15.407 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: You know...

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:17.009 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...you're
getting enough that...

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:18.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...the smart growers
are using full-spectrum lights

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.211 align:middle line:90%
inside the tents.

00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:20.112 align:middle line:90%
So...

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:21.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's good.

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:21.713 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So there
are ways to do this.

00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:23.115 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's good.

00:26:23.115 --> 00:26:24.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know I --
I think the history of --

00:26:24.416 --> 00:26:28.654 align:middle line:84%
of farming unfortunately we
delegated it to other people,

00:26:28.654 --> 00:26:30.155 align:middle line:90%
and we say now when we're trying

00:26:30.155 --> 00:26:32.991 align:middle line:84%
to grow our own farm
people are just ignorant.

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:33.392 align:middle line:84%
They have no clue
of how to grow.

00:26:33.392 --> 00:26:35.093 align:middle line:90%
There's...

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:36.061 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: There's some good --

00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:36.995 align:middle line:84%
there are some good
books out there.

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:37.629 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: It starting
to happen.

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:38.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You know, yeah.

00:26:38.697 --> 00:26:39.465 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I'm growing
in my own back yard.

00:26:39.465 --> 00:26:40.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:41.333 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I mean, I...

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.601 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, I've
done that, and chickens.

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:43.268 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...would have
thought I would have never done

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:44.536 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:26:44.536 --> 00:26:45.170 align:middle line:84%
People are doing it out on
their porch of their apartments.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:47.105 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I mean, you know
wherever you can do it grow your

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:48.240 align:middle line:90%
fresh food.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In their front
yards where their --

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:50.275 align:middle line:84%
their flowers used to be,
which I love seeing that.

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a great trend.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.044 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: I -- I
sprout my nuts and seeds.

00:26:52.044 --> 00:26:53.011 align:middle line:90%
I let them grow.

00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.413 align:middle line:84%
I eat live food wherever
possible,

00:26:54.413 --> 00:26:56.515 align:middle line:84%
and protect it as
much as possible.

00:26:56.515 --> 00:26:58.784 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so
with that now we've --

00:26:58.784 --> 00:27:01.386 align:middle line:84%
we've talked about two of the
most important little parts

00:27:01.386 --> 00:27:03.222 align:middle line:84%
of the engine which are the
adrenals and the thyroid gland.

00:27:03.222 --> 00:27:04.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And --
and the thyroid, yes.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.326 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, now
let's get to the hormones

00:27:07.326 --> 00:27:09.728 align:middle line:84%
that we generally
tend to genderize.

00:27:09.728 --> 00:27:11.096 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:11.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And look at
you know the testosterones

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.431 align:middle line:90%
and -- and all of it, okay.

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:14.233 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:27:14.233 --> 00:27:16.001 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Estrogens and
so forth, progesterone.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.102 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: If I
were to tell you one

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:19.071 align:middle line:84%
of the most effective
cures for cellulite

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:20.205 align:middle line:90%
for women you'd be surprised.

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:21.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What is it?

00:27:21.974 --> 00:27:23.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Testosterone.

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, that --
I guess that makes sense

00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:25.277 align:middle line:84%
because you have more
of it when you're young.

00:27:25.277 --> 00:27:26.645 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.146 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And you know women
who have had tubal ligation,

00:27:29.381 --> 00:27:31.283 align:middle line:84%
or hysterectomy, or they've
had their ovaries removed,

00:27:31.283 --> 00:27:34.286 align:middle line:84%
that's the primary site of
testosterone production.

00:27:34.286 --> 00:27:35.687 align:middle line:84%
And we've done women
a disservice

00:27:35.687 --> 00:27:39.091 align:middle line:84%
because we've removed
millions of women's organs,

00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:40.993 align:middle line:84%
and we give them
progesterone maybe

00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:42.394 align:middle line:84%
if they're lucky,
and estrogen back.

00:27:42.394 --> 00:27:44.997 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even natural
estrogen; it's synthetic

00:27:44.997 --> 00:27:47.999 align:middle line:84%
from a horse that's not even
a male or female gender,

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:50.269 align:middle line:84%
and it's estrone, which
it should be estriol,

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:53.438 align:middle line:84%
and it should be in the right
ratios, but that being said,

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:55.274 align:middle line:84%
women need the testosterone
back.

00:27:55.274 --> 00:27:56.542 align:middle line:90%
That's why they become depressed

00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.443 align:middle line:84%
after they've had
these operations,

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:00.178 align:middle line:84%
why as they get older
during menopause

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:03.048 align:middle line:84%
or perimenopause they go
through cycles and changes.

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:05.951 align:middle line:84%
So women could actually clear
up their cellulite certainly

00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:84%
with exercise and a
healthy plant-based diet.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:10.722 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: But testosterone
is amazing in helping

00:28:10.722 --> 00:28:12.124 align:middle line:90%
to reduce cellulite, amazing.

00:28:12.124 --> 00:28:14.059 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, are you
talking pharmaceutical grade,

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:16.261 align:middle line:90%
homeopathics, bioidenticals?

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:18.263 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know the
exciting thing is I started

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:21.967 align:middle line:84%
studying testosterone
replacement probably a better

00:28:21.967 --> 00:28:23.068 align:middle line:90%
part of 30 years ago.

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.137 align:middle line:84%
When I first hit the wall
when I was in my 30s,

00:28:25.137 --> 00:28:26.371 align:middle line:90%
and I'll be 60 next year.

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:27.205 align:middle line:90%
But when I first...

00:28:27.205 --> 00:28:28.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: You look great.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...hit
the wall -- thank you.

00:28:29.608 --> 00:28:32.277 align:middle line:84%
When I first hit the wall I
noticed at age 38 I -- I just --

00:28:32.277 --> 00:28:35.414 align:middle line:84%
I lost my libido, my sex
drive; my muscle density wasn't

00:28:35.414 --> 00:28:37.115 align:middle line:84%
where it was when I'd
do the same workout.

00:28:37.115 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:90%
I was feeling depressed.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.685 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I was gaining weight.

00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:41.253 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing everything
the same.

00:28:41.253 --> 00:28:42.988 align:middle line:84%
I was exercising,
eating healthy,

00:28:42.988 --> 00:28:44.389 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't understand it.

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:47.225 align:middle line:84%
And I found out my
testosterone was so low,

00:28:47.225 --> 00:28:49.127 align:middle line:84%
particularly the
free testosterone.

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:52.297 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Abraham Morgentaler
who is a Harvard professor

00:28:52.297 --> 00:28:54.999 align:middle line:84%
who teaches -- he's
one of our mentors

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:57.369 align:middle line:84%
at the Anti-Aging
Universities and --

00:28:57.369 --> 00:28:59.104 align:middle line:90%
and Anti-Aging --

00:28:59.104 --> 00:29:02.574 align:middle line:84%
even this last week in
Las Vegas was sharing

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:05.944 align:middle line:84%
with us the absolutely
essential need in men and women

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:06.612 align:middle line:90%
for testosterone replacement.

00:29:06.612 --> 00:29:08.580 align:middle line:90%
It could be bioidentical cream.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.182 align:middle line:84%
It could be my favorite
testosterone pellets for me.

00:29:10.182 --> 00:29:13.352 align:middle line:84%
The women I think do
best with the cream.

00:29:13.352 --> 00:29:16.054 align:middle line:84%
And interesting enough
certain herbs that we've known

00:29:16.054 --> 00:29:19.391 align:middle line:84%
about for thousands of years,
Avina Sativa, milky green oats,

00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:21.093 align:middle line:90%
horny goat weed, Mucuna Purina.

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:24.963 align:middle line:84%
I have a list of about 30 of
my favorite herbs that I shared

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:26.298 align:middle line:84%
with the doctors this
last weekend before this.

00:29:26.298 --> 00:29:29.601 align:middle line:84%
And in my website,
and in my discussions,

00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:32.237 align:middle line:84%
and my books I teach which herbs
that you might be able to take

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:35.674 align:middle line:84%
without even taking
prescription testosterone

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:37.409 align:middle line:84%
and optimize your
free testosterone.

00:29:37.409 --> 00:29:39.978 align:middle line:84%
Because there's what's called
sex hormone binding globulin,

00:29:39.978 --> 00:29:42.014 align:middle line:84%
and it transports
all of your hormones.

00:29:42.014 --> 00:29:43.615 align:middle line:84%
And by taking and
consuming these herbs

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:46.451 align:middle line:84%
in proper quantities they
attach to the binding protein

00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:48.987 align:middle line:84%
and release more of your
bioavailable cortisol,

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:50.288 align:middle line:84%
more of your bioavailable
thyroid,

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:53.525 align:middle line:84%
more of your bioavailable growth
hormone, and testosterone.

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.526 align:middle line:90%
Your body will function youthful

00:29:54.526 --> 00:29:56.662 align:middle line:84%
with these correct
balance of herbs.

00:29:56.662 --> 00:29:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so let
me ask you this question.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:59.398 align:middle line:90%
This is very practical.

00:29:59.398 --> 00:30:01.299 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people watching
this, whether it's a woman,

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:04.236 align:middle line:84%
thinking about, "Gee, my husband
has all those symptoms you're

00:30:04.236 --> 00:30:05.404 align:middle line:90%
talking about."

00:30:05.404 --> 00:30:07.005 align:middle line:84%
Or whether the woman has
these -- these symptoms...

00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:08.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...is it something
if you're going the herbal route

00:30:09.574 --> 00:30:11.243 align:middle line:84%
that they can go onto your
site, take a look at this list

00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:14.546 align:middle line:84%
of herbs, and just start
adding them into their diet

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:17.215 align:middle line:84%
and watch -- and by way
of their own evidence --

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:19.284 align:middle line:84%
empirical evidence as to whether
or not this is working for them?

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.286 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people I know,
particularly women,

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:25.290 align:middle line:84%
no longer have health
insurance, and so we're --

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.658 align:middle line:90%
you know we're on our own.

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:27.693 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:28.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We're --
and we're talking

00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:30.062 align:middle line:84%
to an audience that's
pretty proactive,

00:30:30.062 --> 00:30:31.396 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of us don't
have health insurance.

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:34.433 align:middle line:84%
We decided to go and
take responsibility

00:30:34.433 --> 00:30:35.434 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves, right?

00:30:35.434 --> 00:30:36.735 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:38.437 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So with that we
need to know practical ways

00:30:38.437 --> 00:30:40.172 align:middle line:90%
without bankrupting ourselves

00:30:40.172 --> 00:30:42.374 align:middle line:84%
as to how we can balance
these things back out.

00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:44.342 align:middle line:84%
Does -- is there the
information on your website...

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: ...to do that, then?

00:30:46.078 --> 00:30:46.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Step one is free.

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:47.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:47.546 --> 00:30:48.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: They
go to our website,

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:51.183 align:middle line:90%
and there's a wellness survey.

00:30:51.183 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And the wellness survey has over
22 pages, a little cumbersome.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.055 align:middle line:90%
But it's -- it's page by page.

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.458 align:middle line:84%
There's about 40 questions for
thyroid; about 20 questions

00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:01.993 align:middle line:90%
for cortisol; about 50 questions

00:31:01.993 --> 00:31:03.662 align:middle line:84%
for testosterone,
and down the list.

00:31:03.662 --> 00:31:06.264 align:middle line:84%
So we break all the key, major
hormones into categories.

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:09.301 align:middle line:84%
So you take this questionnaire
before starting the herbs

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:12.404 align:middle line:84%
and supplements, and we
see, based on your symptoms,

00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:14.005 align:middle line:90%
how deficient you are.

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:17.309 align:middle line:84%
Now ideally you should do maybe
a saliva test that's around $99.

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:20.145 align:middle line:84%
Do a 24-urine test
for about $235.

00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:21.279 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a blood test
we can arrange it with one

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.548 align:middle line:84%
of our doctors to
get it ordered.

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:26.551 align:middle line:84%
But all that being said,
if we match, as we've done

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.186 align:middle line:90%
so for the last 30 years in --

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:30.155 align:middle line:84%
in my practice in
working with our --

00:31:30.155 --> 00:31:32.557 align:middle line:84%
our students, and
clients, and doctors,

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:36.128 align:middle line:84%
we get these test results back
after we match the questionnaire

00:31:36.128 --> 00:31:37.362 align:middle line:84%
and we do the history
and physical.

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:39.698 align:middle line:84%
Put that all together, or at
least do the questionnaire

00:31:39.698 --> 00:31:42.701 align:middle line:84%
because it's about 80% sensitive
even if they don't do the test.

00:31:42.701 --> 00:31:43.668 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, interesting.

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:44.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And it
will show them,

00:31:44.536 --> 00:31:46.071 align:middle line:90%
so I'm giving them free advice.

00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:48.707 align:middle line:84%
It'll work, and then take the
product; their symptoms improve,

00:31:48.707 --> 00:31:50.308 align:middle line:90%
and the doctor will be impressed

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:51.309 align:middle line:84%
or they will be impressed
themselves and don't even have

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.445 align:middle line:90%
to see the medical doctor.

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:56.047 align:middle line:84%
Now I -- I usually don't
tell people don't work

00:31:56.047 --> 00:31:56.515 align:middle line:90%
with your doctor.

00:31:56.515 --> 00:31:58.049 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:58.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: But your doctor has
no clue about what we're saying.

00:31:58.583 --> 00:31:59.718 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, no.

00:31:59.718 --> 00:32:00.385 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most people I
know don't have a doctor.

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:01.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:01.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They really don't.

00:32:01.987 --> 00:32:02.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:03.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I mean, they --

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.023 align:middle line:84%
they are renegades
from the medical system

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:05.690 align:middle line:84%
because they've either
nearly been killed by them

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.092 align:middle line:90%
or they're paying $700 a month

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:08.760 align:middle line:84%
for a service they would
never use unless they were

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.395 align:middle line:84%
in a car wreck, and
you have car insurance.

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.664 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: True story, many of
the transformational leaders,

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:14.266 align:middle line:84%
and I could name them, that
you know are proud to come

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:17.335 align:middle line:84%
to see me tell me that
they prefer not to go

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:20.005 align:middle line:90%
to the traditional route.

00:32:20.005 --> 00:32:21.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:22.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And they come to
me because the doctors I work

00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:26.411 align:middle line:84%
with all look at herbal,
supplemental, diet, exercise,

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:28.013 align:middle line:90%
the power of the mind.

00:32:28.013 --> 00:32:30.649 align:middle line:84%
And we figure out if there is a
need for a particular hormone.

00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:32.250 align:middle line:84%
We usually try and go
with a wild yam extract

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:35.720 align:middle line:84%
so it's plant-based, and
the derivatives is identical

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.055 align:middle line:90%
to what's already in your body.

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.323 align:middle line:84%
And then we match
the physiologic dose,

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:41.560 align:middle line:84%
and we monitor people
through these tests.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.161 align:middle line:84%
So many of the people who
normally say they don't want

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:45.297 align:middle line:84%
to see a doctor, they're
proud to say you know,

00:32:45.297 --> 00:32:49.067 align:middle line:84%
"I go see Dr. Nick,
and he's a PhD."

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:52.704 align:middle line:84%
I don't claim to be an MD, but
I oversee you know the program,

00:32:52.704 --> 00:32:55.307 align:middle line:84%
and the protocols, and each of
the doctors that work with us,

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:57.275 align:middle line:84%
and/or clients that just
want to do it themselves

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.410 align:middle line:90%
with questionnaires...

00:32:58.410 --> 00:32:59.277 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:00.278 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...and online help.

00:33:00.278 --> 00:33:01.379 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
really what we need more

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.615 align:middle line:84%
because the audience
watching this right now,

00:33:03.615 --> 00:33:06.651 align:middle line:84%
we're all individuals who choose
to take personal responsibility.

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.119 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think there
are very few who are looking

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.421 align:middle line:90%
for a magic pill anymore.

00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:10.288 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:11.256 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And so I like that

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:12.224 align:middle line:84%
about your work,
that you offer that.

00:33:12.224 --> 00:33:13.391 align:middle line:90%
So now you've just talked

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:15.493 align:middle line:84%
about testosterone
and what's going on.

00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:18.029 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about progesterone
for a moment because a lot

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:19.130 align:middle line:84%
of women find out
they've been on HRT,

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.234 align:middle line:84%
and they've got these
spikes of progesterone,

00:33:22.234 --> 00:33:24.135 align:middle line:84%
and now they're scared
because they're thinking

00:33:24.135 --> 00:33:25.770 align:middle line:90%
of the you know cancer.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.772 align:middle line:84%
So what's up -- what's
up with progesterone?

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:30.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Okay, the
women's health study

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:33.678 align:middle line:84%
which used progestins -- again
a synthetic-derived coming

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:36.414 align:middle line:84%
from horse and so forth, it's
just not even normal to what's

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:40.151 align:middle line:84%
in the body -- did cause an
increased rate of breast cancer,

00:33:40.151 --> 00:33:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and other forms of cancers,
and heart attacks, and strokes.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.422 align:middle line:90%
And there was all kinds of --

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:47.659 align:middle line:84%
of people just getting off
of hormones out of fear

00:33:47.659 --> 00:33:49.361 align:middle line:84%
because they were using
these pharmaceutical

00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:52.797 align:middle line:90%
synthetic-derived hormones.

00:33:52.797 --> 00:33:56.568 align:middle line:84%
But several studies prior
to in Europe and after,

00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:59.704 align:middle line:84%
large-scale studies using
bioidentical, natural

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:01.106 align:middle line:84%
progesterone which you can get
as a cream

00:34:01.106 --> 00:34:03.208 align:middle line:84%
from wild yam extract,
and natural estriol.

00:34:03.208 --> 00:34:05.277 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, what
people don't realize is

00:34:05.277 --> 00:34:09.514 align:middle line:84%
by using these -- or following
these studies that the incidence

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.150 align:middle line:84%
of cancer was far less
than the general population

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.985 align:middle line:84%
who did not use the
progesterone or estriol.

00:34:14.985 --> 00:34:18.255 align:middle line:84%
Not only did it not
equalize, but it was far less.

00:34:18.255 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
So there's protective
factors of these hormones

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:23.628 align:middle line:84%
when used properly in the right
dosages and monitored correctly.

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:26.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Interesting, so if
a woman were interested, and --

00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:28.166 align:middle line:84%
and they've already -- say
they've taken the test,

00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:29.534 align:middle line:90%
and we've already gotten an idea

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:31.168 align:middle line:84%
of what our profile
is and what's needed.

00:34:31.168 --> 00:34:32.270 align:middle line:90%
And they needed to have access

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:36.141 align:middle line:84%
to a wild yam-based
progesterone cream...

00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:37.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:34:37.542 --> 00:34:38.208 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...do you have to go
to get a prescription for that?

00:34:38.208 --> 00:34:39.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: No.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:39.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Where do you get it?

00:34:39.643 --> 00:34:40.712 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: It's...

00:34:40.712 --> 00:34:42.013 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Where do
you get these things?

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:42.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: We have
it over the counter.

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:43.614 align:middle line:90%
People can order it.

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:45.150 align:middle line:84%
They can go to certain
health-food stores.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.217 align:middle line:84%
We like to get the ones that are
paraben-free and chemical-free

00:34:47.217 --> 00:34:49.554 align:middle line:84%
because some of the throwback
to most of the creams

00:34:49.554 --> 00:34:53.391 align:middle line:84%
on the market, even if they're,
quote, in a health food store,

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:55.260 align:middle line:84%
they -- they are
grandfathered in,

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.293 align:middle line:84%
some of these toxic
chemicals in the cream.

00:34:56.293 --> 00:34:58.296 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's a compounding
pharmacist...

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:00.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:01.366 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: ...I petition them,

00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:02.634 align:middle line:84%
and I request what is the actual
ingredients in the base cream

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:04.269 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes there's
certain things there you don't

00:35:04.269 --> 00:35:06.638 align:middle line:90%
want to have on your body.

00:35:06.638 --> 00:35:07.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:09.374 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So we produce
products and monitor

00:35:09.374 --> 00:35:12.644 align:middle line:84%
and evaluate, so I usually list
what I call the Amazon picks.

00:35:12.644 --> 00:35:15.747 align:middle line:84%
I list certain things that I
endorse or believe from years

00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:18.750 align:middle line:84%
of experience, and studying,
and knowing what is safe.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:21.753 align:middle line:84%
So progesterone is a
very important hormone,

00:35:21.753 --> 00:35:23.388 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's a mistake
to think you're going

00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:25.690 align:middle line:84%
to use progesterone
for estrogen dominance.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:27.192 align:middle line:84%
There's this mistaken
belief out there

00:35:27.192 --> 00:35:29.294 align:middle line:84%
that just take progesterone
when I have symptoms

00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:32.230 align:middle line:84%
of estrogen dominance, or I've
been taking birth control pill,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.331 align:middle line:84%
or I've been exposed
to xenoestrogens,

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.233 align:middle line:84%
or I eat a high-fat diet
that can cause increase

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:37.669 align:middle line:84%
in these harmful
forms of estrogens.

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:40.572 align:middle line:84%
The truth is there's certain
natural herbs that come

00:35:40.572 --> 00:35:43.108 align:middle line:84%
from vital chemicals,
particularly

00:35:43.108 --> 00:35:44.676 align:middle line:90%
from raw cruciferous vegetables.

00:35:44.676 --> 00:35:47.545 align:middle line:84%
Dynomethane which is DYM, as
we're going to abbreviate,

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:51.583 align:middle line:84%
and indole 3 carbinol comes
from raw bok choy, Napa cabbage.

00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:54.652 align:middle line:84%
It can come from raw
broccoli, Brussels sprouts,

00:35:54.652 --> 00:35:56.087 align:middle line:90%
so the whole cruciferous family,

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:59.024 align:middle line:84%
but most people rarely ever
eat two pounds worth a day

00:35:59.024 --> 00:35:59.457 align:middle line:90%
like I do.

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:00.592 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Sure.

00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:01.626 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And if they
do take the supplements

00:36:01.626 --> 00:36:03.061 align:middle line:90%
that I have designed,

00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:05.363 align:middle line:84%
which shockingly I created
a product called EstroBlock.

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:08.600 align:middle line:84%
I say shockingly; it cleared up
acne within two months of kids,

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.235 align:middle line:84%
and it's selling all over the
world now because it's clearing

00:36:10.235 --> 00:36:12.670 align:middle line:84%
up their face because they
have hormonal imbalances.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, I want to talk
about the EstroBlock and --

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:17.342 align:middle line:84%
and I know some other
well-known people

00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:19.344 align:middle line:84%
in this field really
think highly of it,

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:21.746 align:middle line:84%
and also the stem
cell supplement

00:36:21.746 --> 00:36:23.214 align:middle line:90%
and the stem cell max cream.

00:36:23.214 --> 00:36:25.116 align:middle line:84%
So okay, let's go -- first
let's go into the EstroBlock...

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:27.252 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Sure.

00:36:27.252 --> 00:36:28.053 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...if you have
estro-dominance in your body

00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:29.254 align:middle line:90%
from eating too much soy,

00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:31.523 align:middle line:84%
or as you say plastic
bottled water and so forth.

00:36:31.523 --> 00:36:32.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.491 align:middle line:90%
So let's -- let's be --

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.260 align:middle line:84%
let's re-review the
possibility of that.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:37.429 align:middle line:90%
Let's say the person's smart;

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:40.498 align:middle line:84%
they're not doing synthetic
birth control pills;

00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:41.533 align:middle line:90%
they're using natural methods

00:36:41.533 --> 00:36:43.635 align:middle line:84%
of birth control,
alternative methods.

00:36:43.635 --> 00:36:46.738 align:middle line:84%
They're not using
synthetic HRT...

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:48.139 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:48.139 --> 00:36:49.674 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...estrogens
nor synthetic progesterones.

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.176 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:36:51.176 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: But they are still
using bioidentical estrogens

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:55.013 align:middle line:90%
and bioidentical progesterone.

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:56.281 align:middle line:84%
The problem is even the
bioidentical progesterone can

00:36:56.281 --> 00:37:00.185 align:middle line:84%
turn into one of the harmful
forms of estrogen downstream.

00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:03.354 align:middle line:84%
The biochemistry turns
eventually downstream to one

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:05.490 align:middle line:84%
of these 40 estrogen
metabolites.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:06.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:07.625 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And most doctors
will never tell you this,

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.194 align:middle line:90%
nor are they aware of it.

00:37:09.194 --> 00:37:11.096 align:middle line:84%
But I wrote the definitive
papers in winter of 2003,

00:37:11.096 --> 00:37:14.132 align:middle line:84%
and I did all the
research on cancer,

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:15.366 align:middle line:84%
and the bioidentical
hormones, and the herbs.

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:19.370 align:middle line:84%
So I believe that hormones
can be modified properly,

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.638 align:middle line:90%
maybe like in ancient times.

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:23.374 align:middle line:84%
We were designed to eat a
lot of raw, fresh, whole,

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:26.678 align:middle line:84%
herbal plant-based foods,
and these herbs have a way

00:37:26.678 --> 00:37:30.515 align:middle line:84%
of modifying and protecting us
while we restore our hormones.

00:37:30.515 --> 00:37:32.684 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Chinese medicine
they were, as I mentioned,

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:34.285 align:middle line:84%
drying the urine to
get the hormones.

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:36.020 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't just
depending on that.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.389 align:middle line:84%
They were using herbal
and Chinese medicine

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:41.092 align:middle line:84%
that goes back 3,000
years, and those herbs work.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I looked at Indian
herbs, Chinese herbs.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.429 align:middle line:90%
I studied the world.

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:46.998 align:middle line:84%
I traveled all over the world,
and I met with the scientists.

00:37:46.998 --> 00:37:48.666 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting. I'd go,
"You're Dr. So-and-so."

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:51.269 align:middle line:84%
And you know they're researching
stem cells, and they'd look

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:53.271 align:middle line:84%
at my name tag, "You're
Dr. Nick Delgado.

00:37:53.271 --> 00:37:54.506 align:middle line:90%
Wow!"

00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:56.241 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was like I didn't
even know they knew me.

00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:57.575 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:37:57.575 --> 00:37:58.443 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So other countries
know me better than they do

00:37:58.443 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:90%
in my own country.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.345 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:38:00.345 --> 00:38:02.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: So all that being
said, it's exciting to know

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:05.717 align:middle line:84%
that the natural wasabi
is 40 times higher

00:38:05.717 --> 00:38:07.485 align:middle line:90%
in isocyathyanase than broccoli.

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:09.120 align:middle line:84%
So it has a protective
factor in the presence

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:84%
of shifting the bad estrogens,
even from progesterone

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.126 align:middle line:84%
and bioidentical, to
the good estrogens,

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:17.495 align:middle line:84%
and then delivering
them out the body.

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:19.998 align:middle line:84%
Wasabi, D-gluconolactone
which is similar

00:38:19.998 --> 00:38:21.199 align:middle line:90%
to calcium D-glucarate.

00:38:21.199 --> 00:38:22.634 align:middle line:90%
That's the patented version.

00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:24.169 align:middle line:90%
We use DYM, dymalmethane,

00:38:24.169 --> 00:38:25.236 align:middle line:84%
but I has to have a
delivery system along

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.238 align:middle line:90%
with indole 3 carbinol.

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:28.406 align:middle line:90%
And we use the correct dose,

00:38:28.406 --> 00:38:30.241 align:middle line:84%
because some people have
used indole 3 carbinol

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.610 align:middle line:84%
at too high a dose, caused
some neurological issues,

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:34.012 align:middle line:90%
so I always look at dosages.

00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:35.146 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So what does
this look like on your site?

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:36.481 align:middle line:84%
What would the product
look like?

00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Because you're using a lot
of terms that most people...

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: I'm sorry.

00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:40.985 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...they're going
to have to rewind this...

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Right.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.121 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and say, "Okay,
let me write that down again."

00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:44.289 align:middle line:90%
What does this show up as?

00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:45.657 align:middle line:84%
Do you have an -- this is
part of the EstroBlock?

00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:46.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:47.425 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: They either
have regular EstroBlock

00:38:49.394 --> 00:38:50.428 align:middle line:90%
which is not a soy-based.

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.497 align:middle line:84%
Some of the delivery
systems you would...

00:38:52.497 --> 00:38:53.565 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:38:53.565 --> 00:38:54.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...use a
soy lecithin delivery.

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:56.301 align:middle line:84%
We don't. We're smarter
than that.

00:38:56.301 --> 00:39:00.205 align:middle line:84%
We knew that people might have
sensitivities to soy, or --

00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:02.373 align:middle line:84%
or colors, or chemicals,
or excipeients,

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:04.509 align:middle line:84%
and additives, or
magnesium sterate.

00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:05.176 align:middle line:90%
All...

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:07.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...our
products are pure and clean.

00:39:07.245 --> 00:39:09.247 align:middle line:84%
So then I created
EstroBlock Pro.

00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:11.182 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting, my staff
went, "Why are you doing this?

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:14.986 align:middle line:84%
You're making a product that's
superior, three times stronger

00:39:14.986 --> 00:39:17.722 align:middle line:84%
than the EstroBlock you've
already released, and it's --

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.490 align:middle line:84%
it's going to compete
with your own product."

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.626 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "Well, some
people have cancer.

00:39:21.626 --> 00:39:23.528 align:middle line:90%
Some people have severe acne.

00:39:23.528 --> 00:39:24.395 align:middle line:90%
Some people are severely obese.

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.464 align:middle line:90%
They need the triple strength.

00:39:26.464 --> 00:39:29.167 align:middle line:84%
They need the concentrations,
and they can get by with two

00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:31.336 align:middle line:84%
or three tablets instead of
having to take five or six

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:32.637 align:middle line:90%
of the EstroBlock regular."

00:39:32.637 --> 00:39:35.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a slightly more cost,
maybe $10 more, but people...

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:38.142 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: It ended up
turning out that I was right.

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:40.211 align:middle line:84%
Not that I'm right, and
you're wrong, but --

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.246 align:middle line:84%
but people, the consumers
said, "Wow!

00:39:41.246 --> 00:39:44.582 align:middle line:84%
I can get this at --
at much less price,"

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:47.252 align:middle line:84%
and there's literally EstroBlock
knock-offs now on the market.

00:39:47.252 --> 00:39:48.286 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:48.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: They're
copying my name...

00:39:48.987 --> 00:39:50.021 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:39:50.021 --> 00:39:51.356 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...that
I came out in 2003

00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:54.626 align:middle line:84%
and actually had created the
science in early 2001, and --

00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:56.127 align:middle line:90%
and released the prototypes.

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:57.262 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this
goes for men, too.

00:39:57.262 --> 00:39:58.496 align:middle line:90%
This isn't just for women.

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:01.032 align:middle line:84%
There is estrogen --
estrogen dominance in men

00:40:01.032 --> 00:40:05.103 align:middle line:84%
which is creating this lethargy,
and a little extra flesh

00:40:05.103 --> 00:40:06.271 align:middle line:90%
on the chest, and so forth.

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:07.672 align:middle line:90%
Can you talk about that?

00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Arnold
Schwarzenegger came to speak

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.276 align:middle line:90%
at our event just two weeks ago.

00:40:11.276 --> 00:40:15.680 align:middle line:84%
His look-alike who in earlier
movies had some issues,

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.148 align:middle line:90%
and he came to me.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.283 align:middle line:84%
He said the doctor wants
to do gynecomastia surgery.

00:40:18.283 --> 00:40:20.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, no!

00:40:20.285 --> 00:40:20.785 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: They want to
do breast removal surgery.

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, no.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.054 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Because most
of the body builders --

00:40:23.054 --> 00:40:24.122 align:middle line:90%
they won't tell you this --

00:40:24.122 --> 00:40:26.157 align:middle line:84%
they take so much
synthetic testosterone

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:28.559 align:middle line:84%
that it causes abnormal
increase in estrogens.

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:29.694 align:middle line:90%
And ironically men,

00:40:29.694 --> 00:40:32.430 align:middle line:84%
who initially they see
these commercials on TV,

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.566 align:middle line:84%
you know low T, go to your
doctor and get testosterone.

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:37.168 align:middle line:84%
Little do they realize,
particularly

00:40:37.168 --> 00:40:39.570 align:middle line:84%
if they're a little overweight,
if they take testosterone cream

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.506 align:middle line:84%
or testosterone injections,
or they don't know

00:40:41.506 --> 00:40:44.642 align:middle line:84%
about what I'm going to share
with you how the herbs interact,

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:47.045 align:middle line:84%
then what happens is they
start developing breast tissue.

00:40:47.045 --> 00:40:48.579 align:middle line:84%
They get big muscles, but
they get breast tissue, too.

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, have to
wear a bro.

00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:53.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And then they
start losing sexual function.

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:54.585 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.653 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: And -- and a
whole host of problems.

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:59.157 align:middle line:84%
So what I discovered
was change the diet;

00:40:59.157 --> 00:41:00.391 align:middle line:84%
they're eating way
too much meat.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:03.094 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, these big body
builders can get as massive,

00:41:03.094 --> 00:41:04.262 align:middle line:84%
trust me, eating a
plant-based diet.

00:41:04.262 --> 00:41:06.497 align:middle line:84%
Gorillas, look at
them, massively...

00:41:06.497 --> 00:41:08.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:10.134 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...the most powerful
animal -- animals on the planet.

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.169 align:middle line:84%
They -- they absorb
large amounts of nitrogen

00:41:11.169 --> 00:41:14.539 align:middle line:90%
from nitrogenous-based plants.

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:17.008 align:middle line:84%
I use a lot of nitric
oxide foods,

00:41:17.008 --> 00:41:18.309 align:middle line:90%
and we'll talk about that later.

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.278 align:middle line:90%
Kale, Swiss chard, arugula.

00:41:20.278 --> 00:41:22.513 align:middle line:84%
It's just amazing what it
does for body building.

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:24.349 align:middle line:84%
But all that being
said I was able

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:26.017 align:middle line:90%
to help Arnold's look-alike.

00:41:26.017 --> 00:41:27.452 align:middle line:84%
Between you and I he
didn't need surgery.

00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:28.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, good.

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.287 align:middle line:90%
They just reduced on their own.

00:41:29.287 --> 00:41:30.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Just
like EstroBlock...

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:32.156 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's EstroBlock;
it's for men as well as women.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:33.391 align:middle line:90%
And everything still applies?

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:35.793 align:middle line:84%
You go through in
-- in your system.

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:38.162 align:middle line:84%
You take the test, you
know the self-test,

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:39.564 align:middle line:90%
and then you can go through,

00:41:39.564 --> 00:41:42.200 align:middle line:84%
and you can have the analysis
via the -- the urine, the blood,

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.368 align:middle line:90%
the saliva, and so forth.

00:41:43.368 --> 00:41:44.135 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: That's right.

00:41:44.135 --> 00:41:45.236 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Determine --

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.337 align:middle line:84%
but anyway the point is
you've created something

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:47.605 align:middle line:90%
that does counter that.

00:41:47.605 --> 00:41:48.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now let's
talk about --

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.541 align:middle line:90%
we only have a few minutes left.

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.176 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
stem cell supplement.

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:55.046 align:middle line:84%
It's Stem Cell Max
Cream for Women.

00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:56.314 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:41:56.314 --> 00:41:57.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Stem cells are
really the frontier right now

00:41:57.315 --> 00:41:58.616 align:middle line:90%
on many -- and they're --

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.651 align:middle line:84%
it's showing up in
many different ways.

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:03.121 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Yes, I also
created a product that comes

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:07.225 align:middle line:84%
in powder form called Stem Cell
Max, and medicinal mushrooms,

00:42:07.225 --> 00:42:09.260 align:middle line:84%
interestingly enough,
have been purported

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.128 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the instances
of cancer by --

00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:90%
according to Dr. Fuhrman.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.698 align:middle line:90%
But we will say this,

00:42:13.698 --> 00:42:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that maitake mushrooms
have been published

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.267 align:middle line:84%
to dramatically increase
the release

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.669 align:middle line:90%
of your own body's stem cells.

00:42:18.669 --> 00:42:21.539 align:middle line:84%
We know that blue-green algae
releases your own body stem

00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:25.243 align:middle line:84%
cells, and beta glucans
from activated barley,

00:42:25.243 --> 00:42:27.245 align:middle line:90%
not the gluten-based barley,

00:42:27.245 --> 00:42:30.281 align:middle line:84%
and also some other derivatives
will increase dramatically your

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:32.283 align:middle line:84%
release of your own
natural stem cells.

00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:36.654 align:middle line:84%
So I've gone about formulating
in powders which you put in a --

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:39.757 align:middle line:84%
a chocolate base; it's a
natural cacao and carob,

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:41.058 align:middle line:90%
and it really tastes great.

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.693 align:middle line:84%
And I also put it
in some creams.

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:44.562 align:middle line:84%
So people are noticing
the difference.

00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:45.563 align:middle line:90%
It -- it does...

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:46.731 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well,
how do they know...

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:48.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...stimulate
the release of stem cells.

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:49.267 align:middle line:84%
Their skin looks
better; they heal better.

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:51.436 align:middle line:84%
Some of the doctors reported
to me scars after surgery

00:42:51.436 --> 00:42:53.337 align:middle line:90%
that they healed better.

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:55.173 align:middle line:90%
Their -- their strength goes up.

00:42:55.173 --> 00:42:56.174 align:middle line:90%
Their body improves.

00:42:56.174 --> 00:42:57.308 align:middle line:90%
Rejuvenation...

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:58.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What is the
source of the stem cells?

00:42:58.376 --> 00:42:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Because that's probably
the first question

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.278 align:middle line:90%
on people's minds.

00:43:00.278 --> 00:43:01.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Sure,
it's plant-based.

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:01.646 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Plant-based?

00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yeah.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.347 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:43:03.347 --> 00:43:04.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: Now see,
I have experimented

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:05.983 align:middle line:84%
because in other countries
they allow umbilical --

00:43:05.983 --> 00:43:09.120 align:middle line:84%
umbilical-derived stem cells,
fat-derived stem cells.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.256 align:middle line:84%
I've -- trust me, I've
looked all over the world,

00:43:12.256 --> 00:43:14.625 align:middle line:84%
but there are some risks
from biological materials,

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:17.762 align:middle line:84%
and I do not -- I caution anyone
who goes to another country

00:43:17.762 --> 00:43:20.565 align:middle line:84%
and tries to get fat-derived
stem cells or otherwise you need

00:43:20.565 --> 00:43:24.001 align:middle line:84%
to be with a qualified
practitioner who's under IRB

00:43:24.001 --> 00:43:27.104 align:middle line:84%
and has done a lot of research
because problems can happen.

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:29.507 align:middle line:84%
But stem cells are
miraculous when used properly.

00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:31.576 align:middle line:84%
And they are stimulated
by altitude conditioning,

00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:33.010 align:middle line:90%
which next to our clinic

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.278 align:middle line:84%
in Costa Mesa we have a
high-altitude conditioner.

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:36.547 align:middle line:84%
Here you're up in
high altitude...

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:37.682 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:43:37.682 --> 00:43:38.516 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: ...but you
see it has to go high

00:43:38.516 --> 00:43:39.283 align:middle line:90%
and low throughout the day.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.551 align:middle line:90%
It can't just be static.

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:43.688 align:middle line:84%
You'll produce more stem cells
through altitude variations.

00:43:43.688 --> 00:43:45.223 align:middle line:90%
We call it c-vac.

00:43:45.223 --> 00:43:47.558 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, and this is a
much less expensive way to go

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:50.361 align:middle line:84%
about it than to have adipose
tissue you know extracted

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:52.263 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:43:52.263 --> 00:43:53.331 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's -- it's
-- I think it's going

00:43:53.331 --> 00:43:54.699 align:middle line:84%
to be a beautiful
thing in the future

00:43:54.699 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:84%
to see what we do
with stem cells.

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.701 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:58.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But right
now it sounds

00:43:58.135 --> 00:43:59.804 align:middle line:84%
like it's very approachable,
affordable, and doable.

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:00.972 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Yes.

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:02.106 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Just one
minute or so.

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:04.075 align:middle line:84%
Any final remarks you'd
like to make when we want

00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:08.212 align:middle line:84%
to take back our own health
profile and hormonal profile?

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:11.249 align:middle line:84%
>> Delgado: You know there's a
list of books that I recommend.

00:44:11.249 --> 00:44:14.118 align:middle line:84%
There's tapes, and videos,
and educational material.

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.152 align:middle line:90%
I've posted now somewhere close

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:18.756 align:middle line:84%
to 500 different
videos and articles.

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.157 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to be prolific.

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:22.393 align:middle line:84%
And I'm so happy to be on
this show because I looked

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:23.995 align:middle line:84%
at the guests that
you've had on,

00:44:23.995 --> 00:44:25.263 align:middle line:90%
and they're my favorites,

00:44:25.263 --> 00:44:26.264 align:middle line:84%
the people that I learn, and
study with, and train with.

00:44:26.264 --> 00:44:29.667 align:middle line:84%
So I think that we're
in the age now

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:33.037 align:middle line:84%
where knowledge is
accessible, but you have

00:44:33.037 --> 00:44:35.439 align:middle line:84%
to have someone directing
you, a mentor or coach.

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:37.542 align:middle line:84%
So if you feel comfortable
with our materials

00:44:37.542 --> 00:44:41.045 align:middle line:84%
on Delgado Protocol or Grow
Young and Slim then access it,

00:44:41.045 --> 00:44:43.147 align:middle line:84%
and utilize it, and
get the results.

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:44.282 --> 00:44:47.251 align:middle line:84%
Well, thank you so
much for your time.

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:50.555 align:middle line:84%
And you do, you have
a very rich site.

00:44:50.555 --> 00:44:51.289 align:middle line:84%
So I -- I appreciate
what you're doing...

00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:53.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Delgado: Than you.

00:44:53.324 --> 00:44:54.425 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: ...and what you're
putting out there for us.

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:55.226 align:middle line:84%
And -- and again,
you're doing it gratis.

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:56.527 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate that.

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.563 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Nick.
