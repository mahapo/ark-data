00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.400 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH:
They call him Dr. Detox.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.490 align:middle line:84%
Edward Group III has
been on a campaign

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.570 align:middle line:84%
to help people clean out their
guts for a couple of decades

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and would say that the
majority of disease

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.460 align:middle line:90%
begins with an unhealthy colon.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.040 align:middle line:10%
When the colon is diseased,
the toxic contents

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.420 align:middle line:10%
begin to wreak havoc
with all of our systems,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.820 align:middle line:10%
and we begin to develop
chronic disease.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.560 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Group says
almost all of it can

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.765 align:middle line:10%
be reversed with a little
education and self-care, which

00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:10%
he explains in his book
"The Green Body Cleanse."

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:90%
What a fabulous book.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
I consider that to be
a service to humankind

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.730 align:middle line:90%
for having written that.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not only detailed,
but it gives you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:84%
the context for what
happens very clearly,

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.980 align:middle line:84%
but it also gives
you the solutions.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's the important part.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.750 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, welcome.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> EDWARD GROUP: Thank you.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.215 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me on.

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:19.690 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate it.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's good
to see you again.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.304 align:middle line:90%
It's been a few years.

00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:22.970 align:middle line:84%
You know what I thought
we'd start with,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.886 align:middle line:84%
because you have such
an intriguing background

00:01:24.886 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
personally, really
of a familial nature,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I thought we might start out by
talking a little bit about some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.620 align:middle line:84%
of the really deep-- I wouldn't
say karmic-- but a deep drive

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.280 align:middle line:84%
you have to do what you can
help clean up the planet,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
including the inside
of our bodies,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.880 align:middle line:84%
by starting with your
dad and some of what

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.630 align:middle line:84%
he was doing back when
and even your grandfather,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.590 align:middle line:90%
great-grandfather.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So tell us a little bit
about Edward Group III.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.530 align:middle line:10%
>> GROUP: Well, this is just
recently I found out this

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:10%
information.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:10%
But since I was a little
boy I was having visions,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.310 align:middle line:10%
and I didn't really understand
why I was here on the planet.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was a
chemist for Exxon.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.460 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I was
in psychiatrists' offices

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.160 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.650 align:middle line:84%
And back then they
didn't have ADD, ADHD,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.640 align:middle line:84%
or autism or anything like that,
but I was just a strange child.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Later I found out I
was an indigo child,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and things were explained
to me a little bit better.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.005 align:middle line:84%
But I always knew I
wanted to help humanity.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:27.610 align:middle line:84%
I always had a love for
animals, a love for the Earth,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But I kind of wanted
to be a medical doctor.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's before I knew
anything about pharmaceuticals

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.460 align:middle line:84%
or the damage that they
cause or anything like that.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.960 align:middle line:90%
So I started out doing premed.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And just before I was going
to go into medical school,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:84%
I met a guy that was doing
alternative medicine.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'd studied all this stuff
and studied all the stuff

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:84%
preparing myself
for medical school,

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
but then this guy challenged
me, and he was treating cancer

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.280 align:middle line:90%
using alternative medicine.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, that's
quackery, blah, blah, blah.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well just
go to the library.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Prove to me what
I'm saying is wrong.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.030 align:middle line:90%
So I went to the library.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.870 align:middle line:84%
I looked up a couple
pharmaceuticals

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and found out that they weren't
doing anything for the body.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They weren't actually treating
or reversing anything.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.660 align:middle line:84%
All it was doing was
putting a Band-Aid over it.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.640 align:middle line:84%
It was a way to get
rid of the symptoms

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:90%
but not address the root cause.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Then my dad came down
with cancer and ended up dying

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:90%
of cancer.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And I knew he was involved
doing some work in the Reagan

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.940 align:middle line:84%
administration with the
cocaine problem that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.670 align:middle line:90%
was down in South America.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And my dad was the
co-developer of PVC plastics,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of
work with plastics.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And then also he was a
developer of Saran Wrap.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:84%
So up until a few
years ago, I thought

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.230 align:middle line:84%
that I was here to help kind
of clean up what my family did.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.340 align:middle line:84%
But the more that I started
looking into my family,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.240 align:middle line:84%
the more that was
coming my way, and I

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
started realizing how
deep my family was.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.660 align:middle line:84%
I realized that eight
generations back

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.400 align:middle line:84%
my great-great-great-grandfather
was Noah Webster.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.010 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that wrote
the "Webster's Dictionary."

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the "Webster's
Dictionary" is a Masonic code

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.420 align:middle line:90%
in there.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
And then we traced
the family history

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.850 align:middle line:84%
all the way back to
Pelatiah Webster,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
who was the original writer
of the US Constitution.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.690 align:middle line:90%
And most people don't know that.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
That information
has been suppressed.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So my family has a long history
with not necessarily doing

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:90%
a lot of good for the people.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Because as I started
doing more research--

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Illuminous is
a word that might come up.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Illuminati,
Masons, stuff like that,

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.306 align:middle line:84%
which were designed to kind
of control and try to develop

00:04:49.306 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:84%
things that were harmful
to the Earth and then also

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.160 align:middle line:90%
to the human race.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So what my mission
is, leading up

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.974 align:middle line:84%
to the time when I was meeting
with this guy, when I realized

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that pharmaceuticals
weren't going

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%
to do any good for
the body, I literally

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.480 align:middle line:84%
had this experience driving
home where I don't even

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.390 align:middle line:90%
remember what happened.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.970 align:middle line:84%
All I can remember is that I
could feel the tears coming

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
down my cheeks, and my hands
were off the wheel of the car.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And it must've been for
probably about five minutes.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
It was just God driving
the car, whatever.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And I just saw this
picture of healing

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
the body the natural way and
moving into a whole nother

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:43.410 align:middle line:84%
direction but utilizing the
mind, the body, and the soul

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and teaching people
how to heal themselves.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So at that point in time,
I went back to this guy.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.215 align:middle line:84%
I told him, teach
me everything you

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:90%
know about natural medicine.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I luckily was blessed with
a good photographic memory,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:84%
so I can learn really
fast, especially

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.660 align:middle line:84%
if I'm interested
in the subject.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
So I got all the books I
could on promoting yourself

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.240 align:middle line:84%
naturally, all the
books on herbology,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:84%
went to chiropractic college,
went to naturopathic school.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.620 align:middle line:84%
Although those also
teach you to prescribe.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't learn
later on really

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
what the main focus of
healing the body really was.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:84%
So that led me into creating
a degenerative disease

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
clinic in Houston in 1998.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, we started
experimenting and using

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
natural methods but
also teaching the people

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.810 align:middle line:90%
how to heal themself.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing we
learned is that everybody

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
has a self-healing
mechanism inside their body.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:84%
What a doctor's real job
is is to teach that person

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
or to help that
person reactivate

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:84%
their own self-healing
mechanism to get better.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, you were
also working with cancer a lot

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.047 align:middle line:90%
at your clinic, right?

00:06:59.047 --> 00:07:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And you were having
some incredible results.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.890 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
a while ago now.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.530 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
How come you didn't
continue that?

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I know that's a touchy
subject when you're

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.860 align:middle line:90%
trying to go outside of the box.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Right.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.930 align:middle line:84%
What we were doing was
cleaning people out really good

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.837 align:middle line:84%
and detoxifying them,
getting their bowels clean,

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:90%
getting their liver clean again.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Because we realized
that all disease--

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter what it is,
whether it's cancer, heart

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:84%
disease, arthritis-- it's
all due to the accumulation

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:90%
of toxins in the body.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.710 align:middle line:84%
And those toxins then,
in turn, cause the organs

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.030 align:middle line:84%
to malfunction, the
cells the malfunction,

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:84%
so you either get cancer,
diabetes, heart disease,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
arthritis, whatever.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
We were focusing on
cancer because that

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.600 align:middle line:84%
was the hardest
thing to get rid of.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you
liked the challenge.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.098 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
in your book you

00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
wanted the challenge
of the hardest cases.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.330 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Right.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.288 align:middle line:84%
If we could get rid of
cancer or teach somebody

00:07:51.288 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
how to get rid of cancer,
then anything else was easy.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So we started working
with cancer patients.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And after they had even been--
had gone through chemotherapy,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
had gone through radiation,
which kills off the normal

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.340 align:middle line:90%
cells--

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.227 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:08:04.227 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --and we started
having some really good

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:06.934 align:middle line:90%
results.

00:08:06.934 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now
that's interesting.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.290 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of
people say, yes, we

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
have this wonderful
protocol, et cetera.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
However, if you've already
started the radiation

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
or chemotherapy,
all bets are off.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It probably won't work.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.103 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that from a lot
of alternative practitioners.

00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:22.180 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying
in spite of that you

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.734 align:middle line:90%
were able to help them.

00:08:23.734 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: One of the things
I learned is I went down

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:84%
to Mexico, and I learned all
the different types of therapies

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:90%
they were doing down there.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.420 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: One thing that they
weren't doing that nobody was

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.380 align:middle line:84%
doing in the cancer industry was
detoxifying the body extremely

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.280 align:middle line:84%
well before they started
giving them and the anti-cancer

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.860 align:middle line:90%
medications.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Gerson's Clinic does so much
with juicing, which is great,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:84%
because that detoxifies
the body and gives

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:84%
the body the opportunity
so when you give

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
the cancer-fighting ingredients,
the body can actually absorb

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.437 align:middle line:84%
them, can utilize them, and
the body reacts to them.

00:09:02.437 --> 00:09:04.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I was going to
ask you what you thought

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:90%
of the Gerson Clinic.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.660 align:middle line:84%
And again, they're forced
down across the border.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.005 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's across the border.

00:09:11.005 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, the reason,
to get back to your original

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:84%
question, is they do not
want people to find out.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And what happened with
me is people showed up.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.140 align:middle line:90%
They took me away.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
They said stop
what you're doing.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.395 align:middle line:84%
You're going to end up dead or
we're going to shut you down

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:25.829 align:middle line:84%
or you're going
to end up in jail.

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:27.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: You were literally--

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: This was literally--

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.135 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --approached.

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:30.030 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: I had death threats.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And they explained
to me-- back then

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.940 align:middle line:90%
I was only in my early 30s.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And so they said, we
have the most money

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.570 align:middle line:90%
going into the cancer industry.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:90%
It's a trillion dollar industry.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: We have the best
scientists in the world that

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:84%
are supposedly working
on a cancer cure.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they'll
never find one,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:84%
because there's too
much money in it.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:02.540 align:middle line:84%
We cannot allow the public to
find out that a 30-year-old

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.100 align:middle line:84%
chiropractor is having better
results with cancer than

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.137 align:middle line:84%
the major systems and the
major medical hospitals,

00:10:11.137 --> 00:10:11.970 align:middle line:90%
such as MD Anderson.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.760 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: They
actually gave you that?

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:90%
They said that?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: They told me that.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.840 align:middle line:90%
They told me that.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.900 align:middle line:84%
MD Anderson still, to this day,
usually only has a 4% to 7%

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.820 align:middle line:84%
success rate, and those are
based on four-year survival

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:25.410 align:middle line:90%
rates.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
that the cancer's

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
always going to come back
after four or five years.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.540 align:middle line:84%
You still haven't
addressed the reason

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
why that person had
cancer to begin with,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.530 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we were doing.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
When a cancer patient
walked in, the first thing

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I would say to them was
tell me why you have cancer.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.529 align:middle line:84%
And they would just
look at me and say,

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:48.820 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I have cancer.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.280 align:middle line:84%
I said, did any of your
doctors explain to you

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.536 align:middle line:90%
why you have cancer?

00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And I would do that
with every disease.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.510 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why you have diabetes.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:57.830 align:middle line:90%
Tell me why you have arthritis.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Nobody could tell me why they
had the disease that they had.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And the second
question I would ask

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:84%
them is, what do you do
for fun in your life?

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.631 align:middle line:90%
What makes you happy?

00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: There you go.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.338 align:middle line:90%
No one asks that.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:13.369 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: And
nobody could answer.

00:11:13.369 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:90%
People would break down--

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Isn't
that interesting.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --and start crying
after I answered that question.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's huge.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Because
everybody that had disease,

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:84%
everybody that had cancer
was extremely stressed out,

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.140 align:middle line:84%
spent no time with themselves
or their family a lot of times,

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
didn't even know
how to have fun,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:84%
didn't have a smile
on their face.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.790 align:middle line:90%
They weren't happy.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
They were living in a
negative state with anxiety

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.565 align:middle line:84%
and depression and
built-up anger,

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't know how to
release their emotions, which

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:84%
was a whole nother part
of not only cleansing

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:84%
the physical body but
cleansing the mental body

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and cleansing the
spiritual side of the body

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.500 align:middle line:84%
as well so you can get those
blocks and those restrictions

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.070 align:middle line:90%
out to allow your body to heal.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.250 align:middle line:84%
Because your body will suppress
all those negative emotions.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: And that also
turns the body acidic.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.237 align:middle line:84%
It tightens up the flow
along the meridians.

00:12:04.237 --> 00:12:05.570 align:middle line:90%
It causes all kinds of problems.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.719 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately it causes
problems in the guts, right?

00:12:09.719 --> 00:12:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And once that happens, we
started having problems

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.690 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm getting
from your book, right?

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: That's right.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:19.012 align:middle line:84%
And it took us a while
to figure this out,

00:12:19.012 --> 00:12:20.720 align:middle line:84%
or it took me a while
to figure this out,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
because I spent years
on this journey trying

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.120 align:middle line:84%
to find the root
cause of all disease.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.540 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's causing so
much disease in this country?

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:84%
And even when they taught
me how to prescribe

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:84%
an herb for a headache,
take white willow bark,

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.410 align:middle line:84%
or take cascara sagrada
for constipation,

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.180 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the herb was, I
started looking and seeing

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.710 align:middle line:84%
this big picture, and
that was even wrong.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
Because, yes, it's better
to take natural medicine

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.470 align:middle line:84%
for a specific condition,
but are you still addressing

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.830 align:middle line:90%
the root cause of the condition?

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Most of the time, you're not.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I had over 260
supplements, and we

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
would choose the best
supplements for each thing

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.430 align:middle line:90%
from all over the world.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
The fact of the matter is
you cannot get high-quality

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.080 align:middle line:84%
therapeutic natural products
at any grocery store,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:84%
at any discount store, not
even at some of the vitamin

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.070 align:middle line:90%
suppliers.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.580 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to find, I
say, high-level, high-grade

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.320 align:middle line:84%
nutraceuticals, which
is a concentrated form

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.870 align:middle line:84%
of an herb, organically
grown, whatever, you're really

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:84%
going to have to
search for a company.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:84%
You're not going
to find it easily.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:84%
So I had herbs being
shipped in from Germany.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I had special formulas coming
in from Sweden, some of them

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.540 align:middle line:84%
injectable, some of them
homeopathic, some of them this,

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.290 align:middle line:90%
some of them that.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.260 align:middle line:84%
So I had a pharmacy
of 260 different types

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:84%
of natural high-strength
medications.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept praying
and praying and praying,

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.100 align:middle line:84%
because I've always been
a believer that everything

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:90%
is in simplicity.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And usually everything is
staring you right there

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.000 align:middle line:84%
in the face and you
don't even realize it.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It's like family
members sometimes

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.820 align:middle line:84%
that have a
condition, and you're

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.860 align:middle line:84%
trying to tell your
family, oh, well, do this,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and your family
never listens to you.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.336 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: They're the hardest to
deal with when there's any type

00:14:17.336 --> 00:14:18.130 align:middle line:90%
of condition.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And little do they know
that the answer is actually

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.680 align:middle line:84%
right there in their brother
or right there in their son

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.090 align:middle line:90%
or right there in their mother.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.219 align:middle line:84%
And it's right there
around them the whole time,

00:14:28.219 --> 00:14:29.510 align:middle line:90%
but they don't even realize it.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.660 align:middle line:84%
They just keep going over
here and keep going over there

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:90%
and keep going over there.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.726 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and people
tend to go wherever they think

00:14:34.726 --> 00:14:36.330 align:middle line:90%
authority is.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Right.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.400 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point
is sometimes--

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
we need to stop looking
for that authority--

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Exactly.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.125 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --and we need to
start looking right around us.

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
ask for something,

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.770 align:middle line:84%
most likely it's
going to come to you,

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.440 align:middle line:84%
if you're paying attention,
in the way of an email,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.300 align:middle line:84%
or just it could be somebody
that's sitting next to you

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:55.855 align:middle line:90%
at the bar--

00:14:55.855 --> 00:14:56.730 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Very true.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --or on an
airplane or whatever.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
It could be right
there in front of you.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:09.740 align:middle line:84%
So one day I realized-- this
image of the body came to me,

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.780 align:middle line:90%
and I saw the disease mechanism.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.460 align:middle line:84%
I saw how all these
chemicals and toxins

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.160 align:middle line:90%
were coming into the body.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them going
and how it was just

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
wreaking havoc on
all the systems.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The metals were coming in
and going up to the brain

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.370 align:middle line:90%
and frying the nerve cells.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:84%
And the artificial sweeteners
were reacting with the metals.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.050 align:middle line:84%
We can list a million toxins,
from artificial sweeteners

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:39.270 align:middle line:90%
to metals and all that stuff.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.610 align:middle line:84%
But then try taking a slew
or a soup of all those toxins

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
and all those chemicals
and mixing them together

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.690 align:middle line:90%
and see what happens.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:47.606 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I saw.

00:15:47.606 --> 00:15:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And I saw the body start
to just break down.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.200 align:middle line:84%
And then the
breakthrough was I saw

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.160 align:middle line:84%
that the majority, 95% of all
these chemicals and toxins,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.000 align:middle line:84%
were entering the body
through the intestines.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So I was like, oh
my gosh, that's it.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Think about it, the
real secret to health.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And then I started doing
research and realizing

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.650 align:middle line:84%
that people aren't having
regular bowel movements.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
9 out of 10 people
are constipated.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.580 align:middle line:84%
The medical profession lists if
you have less than three bowel

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.570 align:middle line:84%
movements a week
you're constipated,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:84%
when should be if you
have less than three bowel

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.780 align:middle line:84%
movements a day
you're constipated.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And the more that I dug into
this, the more I was finding

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:90%
and the more that was revealed.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Why does the medical
profession still

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.340 align:middle line:84%
doesn't know what
the appendix does?

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:90%
That was weird to me.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.470 align:middle line:90%
I found that very interesting.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that for just a sec.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.430 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: It is important.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:90%
Because the more--

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A lot of people
don't have one anymore.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.061 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --that I
started looking into it,

00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:56.800 align:middle line:84%
the more that I started
seeing all this suppression.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.985 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously somebody
knows how important

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.880 align:middle line:90%
the intestines are.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.599 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
look at the system

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that we're in with
the pharmaceutical

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:14.750 align:middle line:84%
and the medical system, when you
understand the money involved,

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.829 align:middle line:84%
you understand that it's
in their best interests

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:84%
to keep everybody sick
as long as they can.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.524 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the appendix
is a key part of that story--

00:17:25.524 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Right.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:27.315 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --as you reveal.

00:17:27.315 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So why wouldn't
the best scientists,

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.590 align:middle line:84%
the best medical researchers in
the world that work for the top

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:41.010 align:middle line:84%
notch medical facilities still
to this day not know what

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:41.910 align:middle line:90%
the appendix is?

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:42.850 align:middle line:90%
That was really weird.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So I had to bring up and
research stuff and pull stuff

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.580 align:middle line:84%
from-- usually the best research
comes from Russia or Germany.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.110 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: And a lot of that
stuff is never found here,

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:84%
and you have to get it
translated and everything else.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.610 align:middle line:84%
And I started finding
research on the appendix,

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
that the appendix is really
like the microcomputer

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:90%
of the whole body.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:10.110 align:middle line:84%
It's like your processor,
like your Intel processor.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And why wouldn't it be, because
it's located in the gut?

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the first exposure
point that your body--

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
all the stuff that
comes into your body.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Why wouldn't your
processor and your reader

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.920 align:middle line:84%
be sitting right
there that can say,

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.010 align:middle line:84%
oh, I have 25 different
types of proteins coming in.

00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:90%
I have calcium.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.220 align:middle line:90%
I have magnesium.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.230 align:middle line:90%
I have this coming in.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And it sends messages to
your endocrine system.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
It sends messages to
your neurological system.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Hey, I got some B12
for you coming up here.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.830 align:middle line:84%
It sends messages
to regulate pH.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So this little thing that's
about the size of your finger

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.140 align:middle line:84%
really controls every
single thing inside

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
of your body, the neurological,
the endocrine, everything.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet, as soon as
it's inflamed, it's taken out.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.380 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: As soon as it's
inflamed, it's taken out.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.310 align:middle line:84%
So that wasn't the first thing I
found out about the intestines.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.110 align:middle line:84%
The second thing was,
why are doctors not

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.850 align:middle line:84%
being taught about the
importance of the intestines?

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:09.710 align:middle line:90%
And so I started asking doctors.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you know
about the small intestine.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you know
about the large intestine.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, they didn't
really teach us

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that much stuff about
the intestines in school.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.560 align:middle line:90%
Hmm.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I wonder why.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, the intestines are 35
feet in length, about 20,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:84%
25 feet of small
intestine, then you

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.030 align:middle line:84%
have about 10 feet of
the large intestine.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you take the intestines
out and cut them open,

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:84%
the surface area is the
size of a tennis court.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say you
had a tiny amount of dust

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.340 align:middle line:84%
in a tennis court and you swept
all that up to the middle.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.410 align:middle line:90%
You would have quite a pile.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.430 align:middle line:84%
That, in combination
with our society,

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.330 align:middle line:84%
where we've gone to
more packaged foods,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
more harmful manmade type of
foods-- pretty much anything

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
that you put it in
your mouth these days

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
is full of toxic
buildup, and the fact

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:84%
that we've reduced
the amount of exercise

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and reduced our
elimination routes,

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:84%
because the body normally
has efficient ways

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:84%
to deal with all these toxins
and chemicals coming in.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Women have five
elimination routes.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Men have four ways to
eliminate, through respiration

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.250 align:middle line:90%
and sweating, exercise.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:28.820 align:middle line:84%
You sweat during
exercise, and you

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.185 align:middle line:90%
breathe heavy during exercise.

00:20:30.185 --> 00:20:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:36.440 align:middle line:84%
That's 50% of elimination
routes in men alone right there.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.180 align:middle line:84%
But with the computer age,
we've gone to sedentary.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
We've got kids
that are obese now.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's exercising as
much as they should be.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.670 align:middle line:84%
And then they have the
next elimination route

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
is diaphoresis, which is
another name for sweating,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:84%
but also urinalysis,
being able to urinate.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:59.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, that elimination route's
been blocked in men and women,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:84%
because nobody's drinking
enough water these days.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's drinking
diet drinks.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Everybody's drinking tea.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's drinking
energy drinks--

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.590 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Coffee.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --coffee,
alcohol, wine.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.600 align:middle line:90%
So we've reduced that.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And all those substances
cause an acid pH

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
in the body, which is
a whole nother subject.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.690 align:middle line:90%
But we've reduced the water.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.450 align:middle line:84%
So our urine pathways
have been reduced.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And then defecation, nobody's
going to the bathroom

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.660 align:middle line:84%
and having enough bowel
movements anymore.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.445 align:middle line:90%
So that's been reduced.

00:21:29.445 --> 00:21:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So we've pretty
much closed off--

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.440 align:middle line:84%
And then with women, how
many women these days

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
do you know that have
normal menstrual cycles?

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.239 align:middle line:90%
Women are just spotting.

00:21:39.239 --> 00:21:41.030 align:middle line:84%
They're having a
menstrual cycle one month.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Then two months
they're without one.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:43.340 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:44.006 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:21:44.006 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
It's changed a lot over
the last several decades.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So we've shut down
all the elimination routes,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.240 align:middle line:84%
so all these toxins continue
to build and build and build

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.490 align:middle line:90%
inside the system.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.155 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we started doing

00:21:56.155 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and one of the most
important things

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.580 align:middle line:84%
is cleansing the intestines
on a regular basis.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I got rid of all 260 of those
products that I was using,

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.850 align:middle line:90%
and we went to a simple method.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
Because I saw when you took all
those toxins out of the body,

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
when the body was clean,
the light came on.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the body was the best
healing system in the world.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It just was crying
out to be activated.

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:30.515 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It was just in so much
pain and so much agony

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that it was
overloaded, and it just

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.980 align:middle line:84%
could not keep up with the
amount of toxins coming in.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what led us into
the advanced cleansing.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So we started cleansing
the intestinal tract,

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.100 align:middle line:84%
cleansing the liver
and gallbladder,

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.072 align:middle line:84%
cleansing the chemicals
and the toxins

00:22:52.072 --> 00:22:53.655 align:middle line:84%
and the heavy metals
out of the system

00:22:53.655 --> 00:22:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and then cleansing the
parasites out of the system.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And yes, every single
person has parasites.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.280 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you
can get around it.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The definition of a
parasite is any organism

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:84%
that lives off of a
host mechanism that

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:90%
does that host mechanism harm.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Most people hear the word
parasite and they think worms.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:18.820 align:middle line:84%
But a parasite is a mycoplasm,
a fungus, a yeast, worms,

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.040 align:middle line:84%
bacteria, virus,
and our bodies are

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.490 align:middle line:90%
overloaded with those organisms.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.624 align:middle line:84%
What happens is those
organisms take your nutrients.

00:23:27.624 --> 00:23:28.540 align:middle line:90%
You might not feel it.

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
You might just be a little
sluggish all the time.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.550 align:middle line:84%
You might not have
just enough energy.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:84%
But those organisms will
take all your nutrients

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.160 align:middle line:84%
from your system, not all but
a major percentage of them,

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and they will slowly
start degrading your body.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And then the real problem is,
like with cancer patients,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.990 align:middle line:84%
we found that each
one of them had

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:58.280 align:middle line:84%
about 100 trillion harmful
organisms in their body.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And these organisms go to the
bathroom inside your system

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:02.600 align:middle line:90%
or expel waste.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.730 align:middle line:10%
Now if you have 100 trillion
organisms in your system

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:10%
and they're all taking
your good nutrients

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.370 align:middle line:10%
and then they're secreting
formic acid, formaldehyde

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:17.320 align:middle line:10%
as a byproduct, as a waste,
isopropyl alcohol as a waste,

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:10%
your body starts
to become this acid

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:10%
and starts getting preserved
from the inside out, which

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.780 align:middle line:10%
is from all the waste material
from all these organisms.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.490 align:middle line:10%
So once we clean
all this stuff out,

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:33.720 align:middle line:10%
then the body starts to slowly
reactivate and reactivate

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.790 align:middle line:10%
and reactivate,
and then it starts

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.397 align:middle line:10%
to heal itself and heal
itself and heal itself.

00:24:38.397 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.665 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
happened even as recently as

00:24:43.665 --> 00:24:46.500 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago when people were
still living off the land.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Let's say your average
family in a rural area

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.960 align:middle line:84%
that had access
to local produce.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:84%
They had it in
their own backyard.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:84%
They were not using fertilizers,
herbicides, pesticides,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and such.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.670 align:middle line:84%
If they ate meat,
usually they had

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to slaughter their own
cow or their own chickens,

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:90%
which were grass-fed.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at what was
happening in their guts--

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.545 align:middle line:84%
because obviously having
beneficial bacteria

00:25:09.545 --> 00:25:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and critters is a
really good thing--

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:16.020 align:middle line:84%
compared to the guts of today
and the level of nutrients

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.060 align:middle line:84%
themselves that were in the food
still before it was completely

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.108 align:middle line:90%
denuded of all of that.

00:25:20.108 --> 00:25:22.810 align:middle line:84%
So, a healthy
profile-- Well, you

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.270 align:middle line:84%
just gave us the
unhealthy profile.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what it was like.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:27.793 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Well, all you have to
do is look at the people right

00:25:27.793 --> 00:25:29.360 align:middle line:90%
now that are in their 90s.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.420 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people that
grew up on the farms.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
You can go to-- and
I love doing this

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:84%
because I'll volunteer-- Any
time I see somebody that's

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.180 align:middle line:84%
in their 80s or 90s, I
love to talk to them,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.890 align:middle line:84%
because you can get so
much information from them.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tell
you the same thing.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.810 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we had our own gardens,
and we grew up and everything.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't start having
problems until their 60s, 70s.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of them are
in their 90s right now

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and their sons have died or
sons and daughters have died

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and their sons and
daughters have died,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:03.692 align:middle line:84%
and they're still 90
or even up to 100.

00:26:03.692 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.310 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: They had the
beneficial soil-based

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:90%
microorganisms in the soil.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.300 align:middle line:84%
They put their own
energy into the soil.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.530 align:middle line:84%
There's been research
done that even

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
if you place a seed underneath
your tongue for nine minutes

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.100 align:middle line:84%
that the seed will
read your body system--

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I love that.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.870 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --and be
coated with your mucus.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And if you plant that seed,
when that plant grows,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:84%
that plant will provide for
you what your body is missing.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.485 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:26:36.485 --> 00:26:39.010 align:middle line:84%
When I first came in contact
with that information,

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.400 align:middle line:84%
I was not only
dumbstruck but in awe

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:45.340 align:middle line:84%
of the synergy between
the plant kingdom

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and the human and
animal kingdom.

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's beautiful
in its implications

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
of passing pure
information, intelligence

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.980 align:middle line:84%
and changing its own
structure and DNA

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.590 align:middle line:84%
to be able to feed you
to the best advantage.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:90%
Amazing.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: It all boils down to
they were one with the land.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.089 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.630 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: They took
care of the land.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.620 align:middle line:90%
The land took care of them.

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
They ate their own seasonal
foods that they grew.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.530 align:middle line:90%
They were out there working.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Their exercise was putting
their hands in the land.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.685 align:middle line:90%
That's healing by itself.

00:27:17.685 --> 00:27:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.010 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: You can put your hands
just in the soil and let it sit

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.170 align:middle line:84%
there, and you can feel
the energy from the land.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And people would bury
themselves in soil

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.290 align:middle line:84%
sometimes-- the Earth has
an electric voltage to it--

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.475 align:middle line:90%
and you would get better.

00:27:32.475 --> 00:27:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.740 align:middle line:84%
The water back then,
the water was cleaner.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Now the air is contaminated.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.070 align:middle line:90%
The water is contaminated.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.530 align:middle line:90%
The Earth is contaminated.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:45.360 align:middle line:90%
You see it.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.090 align:middle line:84%
It's not only humans
that are sick.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.050 align:middle line:84%
When we're sick,
the Earth is sick.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Look at all the oceans.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Look at the trees.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.860 align:middle line:90%
Look at the plants.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.600 align:middle line:90%
We're all connected.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.540 align:middle line:84%
As we all begin to
heal and be healthy,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:02.910 align:middle line:84%
the whole planet starts to
heal and become healthy.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.710 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And back then, in
that day when life was more

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.676 align:middle line:84%
natural and we lived in that
close relationship-- today,

00:28:09.676 --> 00:28:11.050 align:middle line:84%
if you were giving
people advice,

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.130 align:middle line:84%
you would say stay
away from the cake.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from the
flour and sugar

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.070 align:middle line:90%
and all that sort of thing.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
But in that day the quality of
their grains were different.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.880 align:middle line:84%
The types of sugars
they had, the cane

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.920 align:middle line:84%
sugars they had gotten from the
southern part of United States

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.760 align:middle line:84%
or whatnot was still
different in its processing.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And people commonly
had a dinner that

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:84%
had meat on the table,
lots of vegetables.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The mother may have
made fresh rolls

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:90%
and served cake afterward.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.610 align:middle line:84%
But you didn't have
the chronic disease.

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:44.240 align:middle line:84%
If you tried to do that with
ingredients that exist today

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.080 align:middle line:84%
on the commercial market, you
would be ill, but not then.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: The key word
then is moderation.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Back then, even if they
made a cake or whatever,

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:55.950 align:middle line:90%
they might have it.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Now it's too easy
to load your body

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.445 align:middle line:84%
down with sugar
every single day.

00:29:02.445 --> 00:29:06.860 align:middle line:84%
You can have 15 tablespoons
to 30 tablespoons of sugar,

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and it's refined
sugar, number one,

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.920 align:middle line:84%
which does your
body a lot of harm.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And the way that the whole
food system works now

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.810 align:middle line:84%
is it's just so easy
and so cost-effective

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.762 align:middle line:84%
to get food that's been
processed, cooked, microwaved.

00:29:20.762 --> 00:29:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.750 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: There's so many
things out there that can cause

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.410 align:middle line:90%
a reaction in the system.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.430 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people-- this is
how sensitive the bodies are.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.632 align:middle line:84%
Someone can go on a 20-day
organic juice fast--

00:29:36.632 --> 00:29:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Which you just
came off of a few days ago.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.048 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: --which I just did.

00:29:40.048 --> 00:29:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.750 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: And this happened.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You can have one single
thing-- because sometimes I'll

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.570 align:middle line:90%
have an organic coffee.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, everything
in moderation your body

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:51.760 align:middle line:90%
can handle.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.460 align:middle line:84%
When it's overloaded
is the problem.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And I was having this severe
pain up in my shoulders

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.500 align:middle line:84%
and my neck and my head, and
I couldn't figure it out.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I've been vegetarian
for 12 years.

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm 90% raw vegan.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty healthy.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.580 align:middle line:90%
I exercise every day.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't drink alcohol.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.360 align:middle line:84%
I try not to put any
toxins in my body at all.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But I was having a cup
of coffee every couple

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.960 align:middle line:90%
of days in the morning.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.240 align:middle line:90%
It was certified organic.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.240 align:middle line:84%
I was using purified
water, and I

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.450 align:middle line:84%
was putting a certified organic
coconut-- because I don't even

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:34.184 align:middle line:84%
usually eat dairy, maybe
sometimes if it's raw--

00:30:34.184 --> 00:30:35.850 align:middle line:84%
but I was using a
coconut creamer, which

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.330 align:middle line:90%
was certified organic.

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was suffering from
this pain in my shoulders

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:44.290 align:middle line:90%
and my neck for days.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, what am I doing?

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:46.950 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.450 align:middle line:84%
I've got to be
exposed to something.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:84%
So I said, the only thing
that I'm doing different

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is I'm having a cup of
coffee every couple mornings.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And so I went that
morning, and I

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
grabbed that certified
organic coconut creamer,

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.140 align:middle line:84%
and, sure enough, on
one of the ingredients

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.640 align:middle line:90%
was titanium dioxide.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
Now there's still a
lot of ingredients

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.730 align:middle line:84%
that are approved for
certified organic products

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.430 align:middle line:90%
that I don't agree with.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But I typed in titanium dioxide
side effects and everything,

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.590 align:middle line:84%
and, sure enough, it
was severe headaches,

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
muscle pain,
fibromyalgia symptoms.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So I started
digging even deeper.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:29.430 align:middle line:84%
Think about all the people
that have fibromyalgia.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:34.120 align:middle line:84%
How many doctors are saying,
it could be only one chemical

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.070 align:middle line:84%
out of the millions
of things that you're

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.550 align:middle line:90%
putting in your body every day?

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.150 align:middle line:90%
It only took one.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And it just opened my
eyes up to everything

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.737 align:middle line:84%
that I've been talking
about for years.

00:31:45.737 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet we've been
taking in-- most of us are

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.780 align:middle line:84%
taking in dozens, hundreds,
maybe thousands a day.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:51.864 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Thousands a day.

00:31:51.864 --> 00:31:52.446 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:31:52.446 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:10%
So let's get into the guts.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.540 align:middle line:10%
Because one of the areas
that I find interesting,

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.550 align:middle line:10%
because it feeds into the
whole profile of allergies--

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.810 align:middle line:10%
it seems that often someone
becomes sensitive to, say,

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.780 align:middle line:10%
gluten, and they'll
have a panel done.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.955 align:middle line:84%
And then they find out they're
sensitive to eggs and milk

00:32:10.955 --> 00:32:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and gluten, a whole array
of things all of a sudden.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:19.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's all really
sourced back to leaky gut.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain what leaky
gut is, how that happens,

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.190 align:middle line:84%
and kind of the
illusion that we have

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.630 align:middle line:84%
an allergy to those
particular things of a more

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.740 align:middle line:84%
genetic nature versus
what's actually going on

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.540 align:middle line:90%
with our antibodies?

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:34.710 align:middle line:10%
>> GROUP: What happens
is over a period of time

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:39.790 align:middle line:10%
because of the sugar, because of
the meat, which is very acidic,

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.570 align:middle line:10%
because when you
mix foods together,

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:46.290 align:middle line:10%
like when you mix dairy and
carbohydrates and proteins

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:10%
together, they can alter
the acids in the stomach,

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.040 align:middle line:10%
and sometimes the acids go in.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Also people are not chewing
their food properly anymore.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
allowing the food

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.730 align:middle line:84%
to mix with the
enzymes in their mouth.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.291 align:middle line:84%
Talking about back
then, it was very

00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:03.790 align:middle line:84%
important to chew your food,
chew your food, chew your food.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well,
you ate communally.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:05.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: I can remember
my parents saying that all

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:06.770 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.311 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And if you ate with
a lot of people and you're all

00:33:09.311 --> 00:33:11.880 align:middle line:84%
chatting over your lunch
or your dinner together,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.070 align:middle line:90%
there was time to do that.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.880 align:middle line:90%
It was a different pace.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.830 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So what's happened
is you've gone to carbonated

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:21.490 align:middle line:84%
beverages, which are very
acidic with meals, actually.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:84%
You've gone with dairy,
milk, which is pasteurized,

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.420 align:middle line:84%
which becomes acidic and
causes damage to the bowel.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.050 align:middle line:84%
You've got gluten, which
20 years ago started

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.400 align:middle line:90%
to be genetically modified.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And you have gliadin in
that, and that wreaks havoc

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.460 align:middle line:90%
on the intestinal lining.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.170 align:middle line:84%
You have all these
different things

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.430 align:middle line:84%
from childhood,
even formulas which

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:45.640 align:middle line:84%
cause problems in the
guts of young children.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a lack of
the fresh organic vegetables

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and fruits which
are going to help

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.750 align:middle line:90%
heal the intestinal lining.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:58.930 align:middle line:84%
So you have an acid component
that slowly eats away

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.090 align:middle line:84%
at the lining of the
intestines, and then

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:03.090 align:middle line:90%
that causes leaky gut syndrome.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And what leaky gut syndrome
is tiny little holes

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.306 align:middle line:84%
that these chemicals and
toxins can leak through--

00:34:11.306 --> 00:34:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And foods,
undigested foods.

00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:16.419 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --and foods and get
into the bloodstream and cause

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:18.960 align:middle line:84%
the blood to become very acidic
and cause the liver to become

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.929 align:middle line:84%
toxic and fatty and
everything else.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.199 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And my
understanding is your body--

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:25.159 align:middle line:90%
because it is foreign.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.850 align:middle line:84%
It shouldn't be coming into your
body through that route-- will

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.260 align:middle line:84%
develop certain
antibodies to it.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.556 align:middle line:90%
Now it shows up as an allergen.

00:34:31.556 --> 00:34:33.139 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: That's
exactly what happens.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.719 align:middle line:84%
Because once it gets
into the bloodstream,

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:40.639 align:middle line:84%
the body sees it and attacks it
and starts developing allergens

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.520 align:middle line:90%
to that individual compound.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you become
sensitive to it.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.199 align:middle line:84%
It's really your body telling
you something's wrong.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the body always
wants to give you a sign.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So you know you have
something wrong.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.854 align:middle line:84%
You either have gas or bloating
or stomach pain or something

00:34:57.854 --> 00:34:59.270 align:middle line:84%
like that, and
your body's saying,

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:03.050 align:middle line:84%
hello, I don't really agree with
what you're putting in here.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.890 align:middle line:84%
What's happening is this stuff's
going into the bloodstream.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And you go to the
doctor and you say,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm having stomach
pains and all that,

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and then he puts you on
a prescription laxative.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.150 align:middle line:84%
He puts you on something to
control the hydrochloric acid

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:90%
in your stomach.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And then you've covered up
what your body's saying to fix,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.039 align:middle line:84%
and now you have multiple
other side effects--

00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:24.705 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:35:24.705 --> 00:35:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Now you're exacerbating it.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.216 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --because of the
prescription medications.

00:35:27.216 --> 00:35:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And then six months
down the line,

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.160 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be back on
more prescription medications.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.470 align:middle line:84%
Now the philosophy in
the medical community

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:40.120 align:middle line:84%
is to get you on prescription
medications as early in life

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:46.070 align:middle line:84%
as they possibly can, even two
years old, three years old,

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.510 align:middle line:84%
so they can keep you on
medications from age two

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.630 align:middle line:84%
or three all the
way until you die.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I interviewed one
gastroenterologist named Becky

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Natrajan, and she got
out of the industry.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.100 align:middle line:84%
She had a very
successful practice,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.550 align:middle line:84%
but she was horrified
when one of her patients,

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.310 align:middle line:84%
who she had not
been able to help,

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:10.800 align:middle line:84%
kept coming back year after
year, degenerating so quickly.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Came back into her office
after a year absence

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.780 align:middle line:84%
and looked fabulous-- she didn't
know it was the same woman--

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.856 align:middle line:84%
and asked her, what
happened to you?

00:36:17.856 --> 00:36:19.480 align:middle line:84%
She said, I'm only
here for one reason,

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:84%
to tell you you're
killing people.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.650 align:middle line:84%
I went off of this,
this, and this.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was such a
profound moment, she said,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:27.390 align:middle line:90%
I can't keep doing this.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And she went to other means
of cleansing and such.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:84%
But nonetheless, she
said the drug reps

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.600 align:middle line:84%
are bringing around
little bouquets of cookies

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and sandwich baskets
two or three times a day

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.010 align:middle line:90%
even to her office.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And that that was the agenda,
get them on by, certainly,

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:48.620 align:middle line:84%
by five, by the time
they go to school.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Get them on drugs, keep
them on, cradle to grave.

00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.720 align:middle line:90%
That is sick.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.300 align:middle line:90%
It's a really sick agenda.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And I know, obviously, we're
preaching to the choir here,

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.460 align:middle line:84%
but this is something
that we have

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.607 align:middle line:90%
to take into consideration.

00:37:00.607 --> 00:37:02.940 align:middle line:84%
When you go to your doctor
and they make a prescription,

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.970 align:middle line:84%
this is part of a
much larger agenda.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:06.534 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
your health, right?

00:37:06.534 --> 00:37:07.200 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: It is.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.340 align:middle line:90%
It's sick.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:13.070 align:middle line:84%
The good news is people are
starting to slowly wake up.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.420 align:middle line:90%
They're starting to realize.

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Parents are becoming
more educated,

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:20.221 align:middle line:84%
because now you're
getting those parents,

00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:21.720 align:middle line:84%
because of the
internet, number one,

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.080 align:middle line:84%
but you're getting those
parents that are more savvy.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.770 align:middle line:90%
They watched their parents die.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.780 align:middle line:90%
They're in their 40s now.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.760 align:middle line:90%
They're in their 30s.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And even the younger
generation is

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.100 align:middle line:84%
starting to catch on
to this, and they're

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
starting to learn more
about the natural medicine,

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.640 align:middle line:84%
and they're starting
to see the effects of--

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:37.841 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:37:37.841 --> 00:37:38.525 align:middle line:90%
It's starting to happen.

00:37:38.525 --> 00:37:39.691 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: --pharmaceuticals.

00:37:39.691 --> 00:37:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The revolution
is beginning to happen.

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.185 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
throw a picture up

00:37:43.185 --> 00:37:45.170 align:middle line:84%
that shows your
healthy intestines

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.790 align:middle line:84%
versus your
unhealthy intestines.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Now when all these things
start to break down

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.460 align:middle line:84%
and people can't even
go anymore-- as you say,

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.399 align:middle line:84%
constipation is an epidemic--
so you throw a laxative at it.

00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:56.940 align:middle line:84%
What are you actually
doing if you're

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.356 align:middle line:84%
throwing a laxative
at it when you

00:37:58.356 --> 00:38:01.150 align:middle line:84%
have such a weak-looking
intestine, as is indicated

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:05.476 align:middle line:90%
in the illustration here?

00:38:05.476 --> 00:38:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: What happens, what we
talked about with all the acids

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.250 align:middle line:84%
and everything and
then the constipation,

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.820 align:middle line:90%
people have a hard time going.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
factor that I

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:17.430 align:middle line:84%
found that's extremely
important to a healthy bowel

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:21.400 align:middle line:84%
or an unhealthy bowel, and that
is the parasympathetic nervous

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.250 align:middle line:84%
system versus the
sympathetic nervous system.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.950 align:middle line:84%
The parasympathetic
system is when

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
you're happy, when
you're relaxed.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.660 align:middle line:84%
The sympathetic is
the fight or flight.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:39.270 align:middle line:84%
What happens is most people's
digestive tract stays

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.595 align:middle line:90%
in a sympathetic state.

00:38:40.595 --> 00:38:41.220 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: And when it's
in a sympathetic state,

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:44.685 align:middle line:84%
your body doesn't want
to go to the bathroom.

00:38:44.685 --> 00:38:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's
contracted, yeah.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Yes, it's contracted,
and it's not using that

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.990 align:middle line:84%
peristaltic waves, relaxing
waves to move everything down

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:58.320 align:middle line:84%
slowly so you can have
normal bowel moments.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.580 align:middle line:84%
So when people live in the high
state of anxiety and stress

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.340 align:middle line:84%
and everything, they're really
restricting their intestines

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:90%
from working properly.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Now the muscles that surround
the intestines, because they're

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.420 align:middle line:84%
contracted so much and
because of the acid that's

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.975 align:middle line:84%
burning through
the neuron endings

00:39:16.975 --> 00:39:22.220 align:middle line:84%
that the muscles use to keep
that peristaltic motion going,

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:84%
what we've found is
by the age of 30,

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.360 align:middle line:84%
especially in anybody
who's overweight,

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.980 align:middle line:84%
their muscles have
atrophied down.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:36.410 align:middle line:84%
It's like if you don't use
your muscles you lose them.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.120 align:middle line:84%
What happens is the
nerves for the muscles

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.150 align:middle line:84%
around the intestines, they
have no clue what to do.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.500 align:middle line:90%
They're firing half the time.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:45.900 align:middle line:84%
They're contracted
half the time,

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.410 align:middle line:84%
because it's directly
related on stress levels.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Prescription
medications mess it up.

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:54.140 align:middle line:84%
So that contributes
to the strictures

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.730 align:middle line:84%
in the bowel from the
image, the colitis

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.350 align:middle line:84%
sometimes in some parts of
the bowel, the Irritable Bowel

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Syndrome.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.650 align:middle line:84%
All that is different
parts of the bowel

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:04.510 align:middle line:90%
that are just being damaged.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And once your muscles
have atrophied,

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.760 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately we
haven't found a way

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.466 align:middle line:90%
to build those muscles back up.

00:40:12.466 --> 00:40:14.090 align:middle line:84%
You can't have your
intestines in there

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:15.700 align:middle line:90%
lifting weights or something.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:18.292 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Is that why then
people go to Costco and buy

00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:19.000 align:middle line:90%
huge containers--

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.830 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: That's why--

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:20.913 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: --of laxatives?

00:40:20.913 --> 00:40:23.990 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --they go
and get laxatives.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:middle line:84%
And to talk about the
laxatives, the laxatives

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.460 align:middle line:90%
do more harm than good.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.470 align:middle line:84%
The laxatives, they suck
water from your system.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Because most laxatives
are osmotic laxatives.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
designed to do is

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:36.940 align:middle line:84%
to pull water in to
flush everything out.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:37.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.118 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: You have
fiber laxatives,

00:40:39.118 --> 00:40:42.960 align:middle line:84%
bulk-forming laxatives, and
then you have osmotic laxatives.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.610 align:middle line:84%
The bulk-forming would be
like your psyllium husk

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:49.157 align:middle line:84%
or your major brands
with all the fiber.

00:40:49.157 --> 00:40:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Those cause a lot of
irritation in a lot of people.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.448 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: They cause
a lot of irritation.

00:40:53.448 --> 00:40:56.521 align:middle line:84%
Plus all that fiber usually
is genetically modified,

00:40:56.521 --> 00:40:58.020 align:middle line:84%
or it's coming from
China and India.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.000 align:middle line:90%
It's been irradiated.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.680 align:middle line:90%
It's extremely toxic.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:05.160 align:middle line:84%
It might be contaminated with
arsenic, lead, everything else.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.220 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things that
we still don't have requirements

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.630 align:middle line:90%
for is to test this stuff.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Because most herbs, even in the
majority of herbal supplements,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:19.010 align:middle line:84%
still come from China and
India, all the cheap ones.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And still the majority of
people out there buy their stuff

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.330 align:middle line:84%
from a drugstore,
from a pharmacy,

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:30.280 align:middle line:84%
from a grocery store, or one
of those big wholesale stores

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.282 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:41:31.282 --> 00:41:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And what they're
getting is they're

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.460 align:middle line:84%
getting all kinds
of toxic ingredients

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.830 align:middle line:84%
in those that are even
damaging the bowel even more.

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:37.413 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:41:37.413 --> 00:41:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody,
they're over the age of 30.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.880 align:middle line:90%
This has happened.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.490 align:middle line:84%
The action within the
intestines has slowed down,

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:46.720 align:middle line:90%
is not working properly.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:84%
As you say, the muscles
have started atrophying.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.030 align:middle line:90%
What do you have people do then?

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Obviously you have
to change the diet

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.880 align:middle line:84%
and have a lot of
fresh bulk and such,

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.392 align:middle line:84%
but what else can you do
if that's not working?

00:41:59.392 --> 00:42:01.850 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: The first thing I
have them do is chew their food

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.655 align:middle line:84%
until it's a liquid
before they swallow it,

00:42:03.655 --> 00:42:06.630 align:middle line:84%
so the natural enzymes in their
mouth are able to break down

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.360 align:middle line:90%
the food.

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Then I usually have them take
an enzyme supplement too,

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.620 align:middle line:84%
which is going to
help them break

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:15.090 align:middle line:84%
all the different types
of food particles down.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.012 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:42:16.012 --> 00:42:17.720 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: The next
thing I have them do--

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.890 align:middle line:84%
and this goes back to your
question about people who have

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.830 align:middle line:84%
allergies to certain
things in foods.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people now
have different allergies

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.330 align:middle line:90%
to herbal products as well.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that's
working really good

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.840 align:middle line:84%
is I try to tell people
to put themselves

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.415 align:middle line:84%
in a parasympathetic
state before they eat.

00:42:38.415 --> 00:42:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Meaning relaxed.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Meaning relaxed.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.430 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:41.721 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: But here's the thing.

00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:44.420 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you know that
eat while they're watching TV?

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.260 align:middle line:90%
That puts you in a sympathetic.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.420 align:middle line:90%
They eat in a restaurant.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.350 align:middle line:90%
That puts you in a sympathetic.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:51.794 align:middle line:84%
They eat really fast,
which puts you in a--

00:42:51.794 --> 00:42:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Or driving.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.975 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: --sympathetic.

00:42:52.975 --> 00:42:53.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's the worst.

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.130 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: They eat driving--

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:54.500 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Walking, standing up.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.430 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --which
is sympathetic.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:56.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: When you evaluate
99% of the time people eat,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.140 align:middle line:84%
they're eating in a
sympathetic state.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So what I have them
do is the fastest way

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to go from sympathetic to
parasympathetic is deep

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.090 align:middle line:90%
breathing.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Sit down with your meal,
appreciate your meal

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.420 align:middle line:84%
that you have, sit
there, and just

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:84%
take some time,
nine deep breaths.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.900 align:middle line:84%
It takes probably a minute or
so to do, nine deep breaths,

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.370 align:middle line:90%
and then eat your meal.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
you've switched over.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.961 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: And you've put
yourself into parasympathetic.

00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Here's another thing.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.865 align:middle line:84%
It's very hard for your body
to process and break down meals

00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:35.240 align:middle line:84%
when you're in a sympathetic
state as well, which means--

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.640 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's like you're
in a state of emergency.

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.600 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Exactly.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.660 align:middle line:84%
That you're not going to
be able to absorb, utilize,

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.130 align:middle line:84%
or transport your
nutrients properly.

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.550 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have people
that are eating but they're

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.600 align:middle line:84%
malnourished, because they can't
get the nutrients that they

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.087 align:middle line:84%
need because they're
in a sympathetic state.

00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now there's
something else you also do,

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:90%
and that's the use of oxygen.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And when I say oxygen, you
have a particular product,

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.740 align:middle line:84%
which I have used off and on for
a few years, called Oxy-Powder.

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:07.420 align:middle line:84%
But that is an
alternative to using

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.940 align:middle line:84%
an herbal type of solution
to constipation, right?

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.930 align:middle line:84%
But also it has more
benefits than that.

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.070 align:middle line:84%
But talk about the
concept of the Oxy-Powder,

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.060 align:middle line:90%
rather than the label.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Well, the concept
started because I said,

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.090 align:middle line:84%
oh my gosh, if there's
a million toxins coming

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:27.490 align:middle line:84%
into the intestines
on a daily basis,

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:31.120 align:middle line:84%
how can we get rid of
those toxins as fast

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.190 align:middle line:90%
as they're coming in?

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.330 align:middle line:84%
What's something
somebody can do for that?

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:39.070 align:middle line:84%
You know how hard it would be
to tell everybody on the planet

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.670 align:middle line:84%
to start and manage
their own organic garden

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and only start eating fruits
for breakfast and organic foods

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and fruits and
vegetables and live

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:49.410 align:middle line:84%
foods that are
going to be there?

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:51.940 align:middle line:84%
That's something
we would ultimately

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.820 align:middle line:90%
like to be doing with everybody.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But what is
something that people

00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.400 align:middle line:84%
can do on a daily basis
or every other day

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of all
those toxins that

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.310 align:middle line:84%
are coming into their
system, but something that's

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:09.020 align:middle line:84%
going to be safe and something
that's going to be beneficial?

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.450 align:middle line:84%
So I started looking at all
the herbs that were used.

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And all the herbs,
like cascara sagrada,

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:20.060 align:middle line:84%
senna, psyllium, stuff
like that, marshmallow

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:26.020 align:middle line:84%
that are there to clean
the bowel, if you use those

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:84%
over a period of time,
they can cause damage

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.990 align:middle line:84%
to the bowel, permanent
damage to the bowel.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.790 align:middle line:90%
So that was out.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.280 align:middle line:84%
Because what are you going to
do, have somebody do this two

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.290 align:middle line:84%
days and then wait three weeks
and then do another two days?

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Because you want something
that would be beneficial

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that they could use
on a regular basis.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So then I started
looking into oxygen.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And oxygen, it's used by
every cell in the body.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.302 align:middle line:84%
We take 30,000 breaths
every single day.

00:45:52.302 --> 00:45:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And the fact of
the matter is we've

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.370 align:middle line:84%
gone from 28% oxygen before
the Industrial Revolution

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:01.540 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago to even levels
of 6% oxygen in the air

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:02.612 align:middle line:90%
now in some cities.

00:46:02.612 --> 00:46:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.410 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Now base that--

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's serious.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.770 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --fact on all the
fossil fuels, the benzenes,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.640 align:middle line:84%
the chemtrails, all
the other toxins,

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.960 align:middle line:84%
the coal-fired power plants,
which are spewing mercury fumes

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:19.500 align:middle line:84%
into the air, our oxygen
content has gone down.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Oxygen is vital
for us to survive.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:24.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: But it wasn't just
oxygen O2 that we needed

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.685 align:middle line:90%
to clean the bowels.

00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:29.059 align:middle line:84%
It was going to
be something that

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:30.760 align:middle line:90%
was a reactive form of oxygen.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Because we needed
a compound that

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.780 align:middle line:84%
was completely safe
and natural for someone

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.740 align:middle line:84%
to take but that
was going to bond to

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.800 align:middle line:84%
or neutralize the chemicals
and the toxins in the body.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Most chemicals and toxins
have a positive charge.

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.590 align:middle line:90%
Oxygen has a negative charge.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:54.200 align:middle line:84%
An oxygen singlet are
called monatomic oxygen.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And then something that
would be released slowly

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:57.990 align:middle line:90%
over a period of time.

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Because the average
transit time--

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.980 align:middle line:84%
a normal transit time from
the time you eat from the time

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that you have a bowel
movement would be 18 hours.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.220 align:middle line:90%
We haven't seen that in ages.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: What's normal now?

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:12.770 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: 72 hours.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:13.670 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Woah.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.690 align:middle line:90%
Seriously three days--

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:14.930 align:middle line:90%

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: That is.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.200 align:middle line:90%
That is.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: --really
when you think about it.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:21.690 align:middle line:90%
Ew.

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So just
think about 72 hours,

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:25.350 align:middle line:84%
all those chemicals
and everything being

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:25.990 align:middle line:90%
in your system.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:33.660 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So what I wanted to do
was to find a way to stabilize

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:37.250 align:middle line:84%
a reactive oxygen
species onto a compound.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.974 align:middle line:84%
And then someone could take
it, and it would release oxygen

00:47:39.974 --> 00:47:40.640 align:middle line:90%
in their system.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And even some extra oxygen might
go into the bloodstream, which

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:84%
would be great, because it
would clean up in the blood.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And that led us to creating
an oxygen intestinal cleanser.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So how does it differ
from using a standard type

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:01.210 align:middle line:90%
of laxative, for example?

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:02.920 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: The damage
it's going to cause.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.350 align:middle line:84%
The oxygen cleanser,
number one, is

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:05.660 align:middle line:90%
going to give you extra energy.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.340 align:middle line:84%
It's going to give
you extra oxygen.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Which oxygen by itself
we were using for cancer,

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:13.710 align:middle line:84%
because you can use ozone
therapies or oxygen therapies.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And oxygen's just an
amazing immune stimulant.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It helps stop the aging process.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.514 align:middle line:90%
It repairs your tissues.

00:48:22.514 --> 00:48:24.791 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: But does it
still move things along?

00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Well, it does.

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Because what happens is through
an oxidation reduction reaction

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:33.055 align:middle line:84%
it turns the solid matter into
a liquid or a gaseous form--

00:48:33.055 --> 00:48:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:34.515 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:48:34.515 --> 00:48:35.155 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --through
oxidation reduction.

00:48:35.155 --> 00:48:35.863 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:48:35.863 --> 00:48:38.710 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So what happens is
you might feel like you have

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.561 align:middle line:84%
diarrhea or like you're taking
a laxative or you have a bunch

00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:42.060 align:middle line:90%
of water.

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:44.510 align:middle line:84%
But really what
it's doing is it's

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:46.950 align:middle line:84%
like that commercial with
the million oxygen bubbles

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:47.575 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:48:47.575 --> 00:48:47.920 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:50.086 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: If you can just
picture a bunch of bubbles

00:48:50.086 --> 00:48:53.620 align:middle line:84%
chewing up a solid matter
and just dissolving it

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.150 align:middle line:84%
into a liquid, that's exactly
what happens in your system.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:58.260 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it does
work really nicely.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:02.700 align:middle line:90%
What about MegaH?

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I know you have a lot of
respect for Patrick Flanagan.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
part of the equation

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.360 align:middle line:90%
in terms of our overall health.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.131 align:middle line:84%
that technology is
for just a second?

00:49:13.131 --> 00:49:14.880 align:middle line:84%
We have about 10 minutes
left, and there's

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.167 align:middle line:90%
some things I want to get into.

00:49:17.167 --> 00:49:19.000 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Well, it's
all about antioxidants.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Antioxidants are
substances that go through

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and bind to free
radicals in the body.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And really the whole
free radical conversation

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.100 align:middle line:84%
and the damage of free
radicals is nothing more

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.980 align:middle line:84%
than the medical
profession not telling you

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that the chemicals in food
and the toxins in food

00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and the heavy metals, those
are all free radicals.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:40.548 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:49:40.548 --> 00:49:44.260 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So the MegaH is
nothing more than a hydrogen

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:44.800 align:middle line:90%
donor.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And a hydrogen is
the same as oxygen.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:53.780 align:middle line:84%
A radical oxygen is 0 negative,
01 with a negative charge.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And a hydrogen is H1
with a negative charge.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:50:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So it pretty much works the same
as a reactive oxygen species,

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.337 align:middle line:84%
but it's a very
powerful antioxidant.

00:50:02.337 --> 00:50:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Do they
work symbiotically?

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: They do.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Because--

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.410 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That's
what I was wondering.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:06.716 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:50:06.716 --> 00:50:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: --H2O is water.

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.120 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.104 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So two hydrogens
and one oxygen is water.

00:50:12.104 --> 00:50:13.270 align:middle line:90%
But they're binded together.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But when you put
them in singlet form,

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:18.610 align:middle line:84%
they can actually bind
the different toxins

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.269 align:middle line:84%
and free radicals
in the system--

00:50:20.269 --> 00:50:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And pull them.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.854 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: --and help pull them
out and actually maybe create

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.020 align:middle line:90%
some water at the same time.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:25.686 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yeah.

00:50:25.686 --> 00:50:28.170 align:middle line:84%
I have a lot of respect for
both of those technologies,

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.520 align:middle line:84%
so I just thought it
was worth bringing up.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I think they do
work synergistically,

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:32.567 align:middle line:90%
as you well know.

00:50:32.567 --> 00:50:34.900 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: It's great to bring
that up because if someone

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.149 align:middle line:84%
wants-- and the hydration
factor, you see,

00:50:37.149 --> 00:50:38.565 align:middle line:84%
we were talking
about dehydration,

00:50:38.565 --> 00:50:41.210 align:middle line:84%
and that's another big factor
of why people aren't going

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.930 align:middle line:90%
to the bathroom.

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.638 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:50:42.638 --> 00:50:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: So when you take
the MegaH or the MegaHydrate

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.890 align:middle line:84%
or Patrick Flanagan's product,
that's going to cause--

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:49.860 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's all
the same, by the way.

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.360 align:middle line:90%
It just has different names.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: It's the
same thing, yes.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.230 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Take one of those
with a glass of water,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.460 align:middle line:90%
it's going to super hydrate you.

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:00.720 align:middle line:84%
And on the topic of water,
most water these days

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.970 align:middle line:84%
is so contaminated
that you can drink it

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and it won't even hydrate you,
because the surface tension

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is so high it can't even
get into your cells.

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Right.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.220 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:17.200 align:middle line:84%
So now we have so much
more to talk about.

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
that I found interesting--

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:24.320 align:middle line:84%
and you had forwarded a copy of
this particular article to me--

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.570 align:middle line:84%
had to do with the gut
and the health of the gut

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and depression and anxiety,
that the gut is really

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.250 align:middle line:84%
the base of what ends
up being your mood.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Well, since
everything with the studies

00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:42.014 align:middle line:84%
of the appendix and how
the appendix regulates

00:51:42.014 --> 00:51:43.680 align:middle line:84%
the neurological
system and everything--

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.840 align:middle line:84%
and that's interesting to
note because, going back

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.230 align:middle line:84%
to the cancer patients, yes,
there is a study that just came

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:53.610 align:middle line:84%
out that links anxiety
and depression to the gut,

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.360 align:middle line:84%
which means when
the gut is damaged,

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.120 align:middle line:84%
when these toxins are
entering the bloodstream,

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.640 align:middle line:84%
it causes anxiety
and depression.

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And when people don't
have the right amount

00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:06.990 align:middle line:84%
of the good probiotics
that they need--

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:09.490 align:middle line:84%
see, a lot of these
probiotics, which

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:11.960 align:middle line:84%
are the beneficial
bacteria in your gut,

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.430 align:middle line:84%
those produce
vitamins and minerals.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes those actually
produce serotonin and chemicals

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.760 align:middle line:90%
that can keep you calm as well.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.280 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
serotonin, the main production

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.890 align:middle line:90%
is in the gut.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:29.025 align:middle line:84%
But not only that, it's
hard for that serotonin

00:52:29.025 --> 00:52:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to get or it might be bonded
to some other chemical

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:36.245 align:middle line:84%
by the time-- it might not
even make it to the brain

00:52:36.245 --> 00:52:38.370 align:middle line:84%
where it's supposed to be
because of all the damage

00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:40.860 align:middle line:90%
that people have.

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.730 align:middle line:84%
When we started
cleaning out people,

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:47.390 align:middle line:84%
we were addressing anger issues
and depression and anxiety.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:50.590 align:middle line:84%
But when we started cleaning
the gut and repairing the gut,

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:53.210 align:middle line:84%
a lot of those symptoms
of anxiety and depression

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:55.880 align:middle line:84%
started going away,
which was an amazing side

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.470 align:middle line:90%
effect of cleansing.

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:02.940 align:middle line:84%
No more anti-anxiety drugs,
no more antidepressants,

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.740 align:middle line:84%
and people started to
realize, oh my gosh,

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just crazy and
depressed and have anxiety.

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:11.940 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff was
coming from the food

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I was putting in, the
chemicals I was putting in,

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.920 align:middle line:84%
and because my gut wasn't
clean and my body wasn't clean.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.650 align:middle line:84%
The liver can't even
process half of this stuff.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:20.670 align:middle line:90%
It's so congested.

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So it just goes and
gets stored in organs.

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:25.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And so people go
to their back up behaviors

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:29.370 align:middle line:84%
of grabbing a muffin and a mocha
to create an artificial kind

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.680 align:middle line:90%
of serotonin response, really.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they're just causing
more damage and more damage.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I thought it was
worth bringing that one up.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:37.750 align:middle line:90%
What about weight loss?

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:40.344 align:middle line:84%
Once you start cleaning out your
guts, what happens to people?

00:53:40.344 --> 00:53:43.010 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people I know
that really don't eat that much

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:45.540 align:middle line:84%
food and even eat what they
think is a fairly decent

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.350 align:middle line:84%
quality of food but cannot lose
the weight on their bodies.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And let's just not
talk about exercise,

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:53.780 align:middle line:84%
because we know
that's part of it.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Let's just talk about the
kind of messy guts part of it

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:58.370 align:middle line:90%
once you clean the guts out.

00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: Once the body is able
to actually function again,

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:02.010 align:middle line:90%
the weight comes off.

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:04.130 align:middle line:84%
And I've always said
this for many years,

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:07.350 align:middle line:84%
because we figured this
out with weight loss.

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Most of people that are
sick are overweight.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Once we had them do not
necessarily the intestinal

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:15.770 align:middle line:84%
cleanse-- yes, people
would lose 4 to 12

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:19.060 align:middle line:84%
to even sometimes 20 pounds
with an intestinal cleanse,

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.390 align:middle line:84%
but that's just because they
had so much garbage in it,

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.730 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't really fat loss.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Once they completed three
liver and gallbladder cleanses

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:32.090 align:middle line:84%
is when the weight
started to drop.

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:35.150 align:middle line:84%
That's when we started linking
weight loss to congested liver.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the liver is
what processes your fat.

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:41.060 align:middle line:84%
It's what regulates
your metabolism.

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:44.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the main organ which
controls the fat stores

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.140 align:middle line:90%
and burning the fat stores.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So the phase one and phase
two detoxification systems

00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.340 align:middle line:90%
are the liver.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a book, "The 10
Super Secrets to Weight Loss."

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.210 align:middle line:84%
That book number one
secret to weight loss

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.880 align:middle line:84%
is do three liver and
gallbladder cleanses.

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Clean the liver, and then
the weight starts coming off.

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And the second
key to weight loss

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:06.150 align:middle line:84%
is not mixing certain
foods together as well,

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:12.610 align:middle line:84%
because you want to let your
body naturally burn that fat

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:16.910 align:middle line:84%
and utilize the nutrients that
it needs eating healthier.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're a big
proponent of doing things

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:21.800 align:middle line:84%
in kind of a gentle
way and taking time.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Don't shock the body by suddenly
pulling yourself off-- well,

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:27.860 align:middle line:84%
other than smoking or
something-- right away.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:30.240 align:middle line:84%
And does that go for
the cleanses as well?

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot of people
are discouraged cleansing,

00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:36.440 align:middle line:84%
because they try it and they
just feel sicker than a dog

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.050 align:middle line:90%
the first day out of the chute.

00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend ways
that you can do it

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.380 align:middle line:90%
that are much more gentle?

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: We pretty
much designed a program,

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:48.000 align:middle line:84%
like a nine-step body cleanse
that people can do which slowly

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.960 align:middle line:90%
takes them through.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.325 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: OK.

00:55:49.325 --> 00:55:50.658 align:middle line:90%
>> GROUP: Everybody's different.

00:55:50.658 --> 00:55:54.350 align:middle line:84%
It depends on who you are, where
you are, what your diet is.

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:57.710 align:middle line:84%
We try to simplify it to
reduce the amount of symptoms.

00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:59.430 align:middle line:84%
But another thing
that we tell people

00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:03.010 align:middle line:84%
is that's just one more reason
why you should continue.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if your body is
giving you headaches now

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:10.420 align:middle line:84%
or if you feel bad,
that's a good sign

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:13.060 align:middle line:84%
that your body is starting
to eliminate the toxins.

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And drink more water,
flush those things out.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.400 align:middle line:84%
And we always say give
your body 72 hours.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.140 align:middle line:84%
By the third day
or the fourth day,

00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:22.950 align:middle line:90%
you should be feeling better.

00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:24.030 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: That's good.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.390 align:middle line:84%
>> GROUP: But going into
after we start cleansing,

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:30.710 align:middle line:84%
at the same time we're educating
individuals on what the things

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:34.930 align:middle line:84%
are that are causing their
problems and then replacing

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.355 align:middle line:90%
those with natural replacements.

00:56:36.355 --> 00:56:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you and I
are going to have a second

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.340 align:middle line:84%
discussion on all
of those things,

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:44.360 align:middle line:84%
how the toxins come into the
body and the array of sources

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.150 align:middle line:84%
of toxins, in a separate
one-hour discussion.

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And meanwhile, for
anybody that wants

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.600 align:middle line:84%
to take a look at "The
Green Body Cleanse," that's

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.830 align:middle line:90%
a really good place to start.

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:54.954 align:middle line:10%
So again, if you want a
better understanding of how

00:56:54.954 --> 00:56:57.675 align:middle line:10%
your guts work, you can go
to globalhealingcenter.com,

00:56:57.675 --> 00:56:59.610 align:middle line:10%
and you can find "The
Green Body Cleanse" book

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:01.110 align:middle line:10%
there along with
other products that

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.020 align:middle line:10%
are beneficial to
the colon care.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.760 align:middle line:10%
So in our next
conversation we'll

00:57:04.760 --> 00:57:07.900 align:middle line:10%
be looking at the toxins
in our food and homes.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
