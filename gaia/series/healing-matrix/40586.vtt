00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:35.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: What if
there were definitive proof

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.805 align:middle line:84%
that coffee is good for
your brain and body?

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:39.340 align:middle line:90%
Would that make you happy?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.009 align:middle line:84%
Well, you might have to prepare
it in a slightly strange way

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.278 align:middle line:84%
but the fact remains
that coffee may, indeed,

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:47.681 align:middle line:84%
be a valuable addition to a
high-performance life after all.

00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:51.318 align:middle line:84%
Silicon Valley investor Dave
Asprey was stressed out,

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.587 align:middle line:84%
overweight and mentally
sluggish living

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:55.923 align:middle line:84%
in the intense world
of high tech.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.025 align:middle line:84%
With this, his life
suffered from all sides.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.995 align:middle line:84%
He decided to do some
very deep investigation

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:03.898 align:middle line:84%
into his own health profile
which he calls biohacking.

00:01:03.898 --> 00:01:06.367 align:middle line:84%
His discoveries cost
him a small fortune

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:10.104 align:middle line:84%
and he now shares what he
learned with all of us, free.

00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:11.872 align:middle line:84%
I so appreciate what
you're doing.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:15.543 align:middle line:84%
My God, I mean, there is so much
information and just off camera,

00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:19.246 align:middle line:84%
I'm flying high just -- I
have a contact high just

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.315 align:middle line:84%
because of all the information
you've been sharing with me

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:23.684 align:middle line:84%
and we haven't even
started the show yet.

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.719 align:middle line:84%
>> Dave Asprey: There are a
lot of ways to help people.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.323 align:middle line:84%
In fact there's more ways that
you can improve how you perform

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:30.858 align:middle line:90%
than you probably have time for.

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.126 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So for me, I
investigated as many of these

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.396 align:middle line:84%
as I could and I tried
to find a way for people

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
to know what's going to
give you the most benefit

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.998 align:middle line:90%
in the least amount of time.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.468 align:middle line:84%
Which means instead of having
to filter the whole world,

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.771 align:middle line:84%
you can sort of try the
most likely candidates

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
to make you feel better and
perform better and think better

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.943 align:middle line:84%
and meditate better
and be a better parent

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:50.277 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:51.545 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, that's a very
good strategy particularly

00:01:51.545 --> 00:01:54.215 align:middle line:84%
for a Western audience,
particularly

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.717 align:middle line:84%
for American audiences and
we have a global audience

00:01:56.717 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
but you know, we want
the fast fix thing.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.724 align:middle line:84%
So I appreciate anything
that genuinely does take us

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:06.927 align:middle line:84%
on a fast track to better
performance while not

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.562 align:middle line:84%
compromising us in
some other way.

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:10.798 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people hear
this and they have problems

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:14.768 align:middle line:84%
like adrenal fatigue and
issues with overweight

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and so much comes out.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.071 align:middle line:90%
Don't drink coffee.

00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:18.305 align:middle line:90%
Don't drink coffee.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.975 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're going
to explain why

00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:23.344 align:middle line:84%
that actually may be good
advice on one level but not

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:26.213 align:middle line:90%
such good advice on another.

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.883 align:middle line:84%
But first of all, let's talk
about you and yak butter

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:31.018 align:middle line:84%
and how [laughter] and
what happened to you.

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I
just want to say,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.922 align:middle line:84%
we have our tea kettle
going because we're going

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:36.557 align:middle line:84%
to do a live demonstration
of the way

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:40.628 align:middle line:84%
to make this incredibly
health-promoting coffee.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So just -- there's a little
sound in the background.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.264 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:47.401 align:middle line:84%
How did yak butter
get into this story?

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I really had
a problem with my health.

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.841 align:middle line:84%
I weighed 300 pounds and I was
getting cognitive dysfunction

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.278 align:middle line:84%
while pursuing a high-tech
Silicon Valley career.

00:02:57.278 --> 00:03:00.347 align:middle line:84%
I went through a pretty
difficult divorce actually.

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that, I
completed my MBA at one

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.086 align:middle line:84%
of the top schools and
barely made it through.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:09.323 align:middle line:84%
I was actually taking
cognitive enhancing substances

00:03:09.323 --> 00:03:10.424 align:middle line:84%
and trying all these
different things.

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:11.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And you're smart.

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.161 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I am smart but
being smart is one thing.

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Keeping energy in
your brain is another.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So if you're
smart for five seconds

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:19.667 align:middle line:84%
and then you forget what you're
doing and then you're smart

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.802 align:middle line:84%
for five seconds, that's
what was happening to me

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.537 align:middle line:90%
in school and in my job.

00:03:23.537 --> 00:03:24.937 align:middle line:90%
What happened in that meeting?

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.774 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure I was supposed
to do something but I forgot.

00:03:26.774 --> 00:03:28.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, not good, yeah.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It was that bad
as a young man and I decided

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:31.745 align:middle line:90%
to take some time off.

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.347 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Tibet and Nepal.

00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:37.117 align:middle line:84%
And I spent three months so
I spent time in a monastery,

00:03:37.117 --> 00:03:40.154 align:middle line:84%
a Tibetan monastery, just
learning how to meditate.

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:42.056 align:middle line:84%
And I spent some
more time looking

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:45.059 align:middle line:84%
at all these different
things that are more

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:49.463 align:middle line:84%
of an Eastern tradition and
what really impacted me was

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:53.233 align:middle line:84%
in the remote parts of
Western Tibet, Mount Kailash

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.736 align:middle line:84%
which is the headwaters for
the Ganges and Indus Rivers

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:58.706 align:middle line:84%
and a very spiritual mountain
for the Hindu religion as well

00:03:58.706 --> 00:04:01.542 align:middle line:84%
as for Buddhism and another
older religion called Bon

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:04.011 align:middle line:84%
which is tied with
shamanic practices.

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:06.814 align:middle line:84%
They all consider this
the home of their gods.

00:04:06.814 --> 00:04:10.017 align:middle line:84%
And it's never been climbed
because the top is very sacred.

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:12.453 align:middle line:84%
But you go and you
walk a 26-mile circle

00:04:12.453 --> 00:04:14.355 align:middle line:90%
around this at 18,000 feet.

00:04:14.355 --> 00:04:17.658 align:middle line:84%
You know, very high altitude
at negative 10 degrees

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:20.194 align:middle line:84%
and all along the way are these
little guesthouses with these

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:22.796 align:middle line:84%
like lovely Tibetan people
that are about this tall,

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.965 align:middle line:84%
like really short because
of the high altitude.

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:25.966 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:27.201 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: But tough
strong people

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:30.304 align:middle line:90%
and they live on yak butter tea.

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:31.872 align:middle line:84%
Even though it's
a nomadic culture,

00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
they carry these big
heavy wooden churns around

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.076 align:middle line:84%
and they put butter and tea in
every morning and they churn it

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
up and down and what
happens is you get the stuff.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.315 align:middle line:84%
I said, "Well okay,
there's no food here.

00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:42.383 align:middle line:90%
I'll drink it."

00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:44.418 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, "Why
do I feel so good?"

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:47.287 align:middle line:84%
I've done high altitude
mountaineering in the Andes

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.655 align:middle line:90%
and I didn't feel so good.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:51.492 align:middle line:84%
So I came back after
this meditation

00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and relaxing experience
and being

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.864 align:middle line:84%
in this really remote
beautiful part of the world.

00:04:56.864 --> 00:04:58.732 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, I want
to do this at home.

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.934 align:middle line:84%
So I made some tea and I
threw some butter in there

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to really
not drink it.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.838 align:middle line:90%
It was gross.

00:05:04.838 --> 00:05:07.608 align:middle line:84%
And over time, I realized
okay, the butter matters.

00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:10.744 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at what
did the cows eat?

00:05:10.744 --> 00:05:11.912 align:middle line:90%
That's the variable.

00:05:11.912 --> 00:05:13.781 align:middle line:84%
Yaks eat lichen and
whatever else is up there.

00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:14.481 align:middle line:90%
There's not much.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.184 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So their milk and
their butter taste different

00:05:17.184 --> 00:05:19.119 align:middle line:90%
and it has different nutrients.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:21.488 align:middle line:84%
I also run an anti-ageing
nonprofit group called the

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.557 align:middle line:90%
Silicon Valley Health Institute.

00:05:23.557 --> 00:05:27.261 align:middle line:84%
And I've been chairman or
president for about 10 years.

00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:28.796 align:middle line:84%
So I've had all these
people come through talking

00:05:28.796 --> 00:05:30.197 align:middle line:84%
about nutrients and
educating me.

00:05:30.197 --> 00:05:34.067 align:middle line:84%
So things like vitamin K-2
and conjugated linoleic acid

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:37.137 align:middle line:84%
and very specifically,
something called butyric acid is

00:05:37.137 --> 00:05:38.071 align:middle line:90%
in butter.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.673 align:middle line:90%
Butyric acid heals the gut

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.041 align:middle line:84%
and it reduces inflammation
in the brain.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:45.078 align:middle line:84%
I think that's why the Tibetans
are so into their butter

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.147 align:middle line:84%
because they're a
meditating culture

00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:49.383 align:middle line:84%
and consciousness
matters very much.

00:05:49.383 --> 00:05:52.553 align:middle line:84%
When you have butyric acid,
the brain is less inflamed

00:05:52.553 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle line:84%
and a less-inflamed brain can
conduct electricity faster

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.457 align:middle line:90%
and better.

00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:57.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay,
now wait a minute.

00:05:57.391 --> 00:06:00.828 align:middle line:84%
You just opened up
a big subject.

00:06:00.828 --> 00:06:02.296 align:middle line:90%
So we think of brain fog.

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:06.133 align:middle line:84%
I mean, our lifestyle creates
a lot of that kind of fogginess

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:07.501 align:middle line:90%
when we wake up in the morning.

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:10.237 align:middle line:84%
We're just disoriented and not
ready to move into the day.

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:13.207 align:middle line:84%
And so we put on any old cup
of Joe but what you're talking

00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:16.944 align:middle line:84%
about there is A, it sounds
like it opens pathways

00:06:16.944 --> 00:06:20.247 align:middle line:84%
to our connection with the
finer aspects of ourselves.

00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:21.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:06:21.615 --> 00:06:25.252 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I.e. deep, beyond
deep meditation and what kind

00:06:25.252 --> 00:06:27.654 align:middle line:84%
of effect would that
have on an ageing brain?

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:30.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a big
one because a lot

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.391 align:middle line:90%
of people, we've seen studies.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.327 align:middle line:84%
Oh coffee is good for
seniors, you know,

00:06:33.327 --> 00:06:34.895 align:middle line:90%
and it helps with Alzheimer's.

00:06:34.895 --> 00:06:37.397 align:middle line:84%
But what you're saying sounds
qualitatively different.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:38.832 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Well, this
is just the butter.

00:06:38.832 --> 00:06:40.334 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the
coffee, it's even better.

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:41.368 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, I
know and so I'm saying,

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:42.936 align:middle line:90%
so let's talk about it blended.

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:45.038 align:middle line:84%
Our coffee is going to be
ready in about three minutes

00:06:45.038 --> 00:06:46.306 align:middle line:90%
and we'll show a process here.

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:47.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Let's talk
about the full coffee.

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:48.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Let's do that first.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:51.912 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: We start with coffee.

00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:55.249 align:middle line:84%
Coffee can have these
amazing properties.

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:56.916 align:middle line:84%
Coffee, if you do
a Google search

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:59.319 align:middle line:84%
for almost any different
condition you can think of,

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.622 align:middle line:84%
just type it into Google
and see what comes up.

00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:03.056 align:middle line:90%
And you'll be amazed to find

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:04.758 align:middle line:84%
that coffee has all
these properties

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:07.327 align:middle line:84%
that aren't commonly talked
about by the coffee industry,

00:07:07.327 --> 00:07:09.496 align:middle line:84%
even though the scientists
know about it.

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:10.397 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Health benefits
you're speaking of?

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:11.064 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:12.432 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Oh yeah.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:13.967 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely some good
things coffee can do for you,

00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.702 align:middle line:90%
for your brain, for your body.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:17.037 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
there's a bunch of studies

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.940 align:middle line:84%
that say coffee is bad for
you and we've all heard those.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We don't like being
conflicted about this subject.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:23.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: No.

00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:25.712 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Which is why I
invited you here [laughter].

00:07:25.712 --> 00:07:28.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I love coffee but
I gave it up for five years

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:31.184 align:middle line:84%
because of my adrenals, because
when I would drink coffee,

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:33.453 align:middle line:84%
I would feel good and then I
would get this like anxiety

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.222 align:middle line:90%
and jitter and tension here.

00:07:35.222 --> 00:07:36.924 align:middle line:90%
And I did not feel good.

00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:38.759 align:middle line:90%
And then I would even get

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.528 align:middle line:84%
like a forehead feeling
that wasn't positive.

00:07:41.528 --> 00:07:43.997 align:middle line:90%
So I'd go back and forth.

00:07:43.997 --> 00:07:46.065 align:middle line:84%
I realized one day, half
the studies say it's good;

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:47.367 align:middle line:90%
half the studies say it's bad.

00:07:47.367 --> 00:07:49.336 align:middle line:90%
It's not me.

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:52.539 align:middle line:84%
It's that some coffee's
different than other coffee.

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:54.708 align:middle line:84%
And I went through all the
research for coffee and realized

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:57.878 align:middle line:78%
if you make coffee the right
way starting with how it's
grown,

00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:01.448 align:middle line:84%
with how it's picked, with
where it's grown and you get

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:05.352 align:middle line:84%
that right, including where
they make it into green coffee,

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:07.087 align:middle line:84%
it has very different
chemical properties

00:08:07.087 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:84%
than the stuff you buy at
the normal store today.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.225 align:middle line:84%
How it's roasted matters, but
it's a small detail compared

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:14.761 align:middle line:84%
to how it's produced
in the first place.

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:16.797 align:middle line:84%
So I went through and
designed a process

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:18.799 align:middle line:90%
for coffee for mental clarity.

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:20.467 align:middle line:84%
And that's what upgraded
coffee is.

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:22.302 align:middle line:84%
This is coffee that
has the good stuff

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:24.972 align:middle line:84%
and we eliminate the bad
stuff and then we lab test it

00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
these toxins that come

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.141 align:middle line:84%
from molds during
the fermentation.

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:29.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Molds, okay.

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:30.911 align:middle line:84%
And is it that common
to have mold in coffee?

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:34.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It is so common that
get this, in the European Union

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:38.352 align:middle line:84%
and most of Asia,
especially Southeast Asia;

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:41.989 align:middle line:84%
there are limitations of five
parts per billion for one

00:08:41.989 --> 00:08:43.991 align:middle line:84%
of the many toxins
that I test for.

00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:47.194 align:middle line:84%
The U.S. has no regulation
for that.

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that coffee
that's so dirty, it's not legal

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.799 align:middle line:84%
to sell in Europe gets sent
to the U.S. and we drink it.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh gross.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.202 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And it
causes brain fog.

00:08:55.202 --> 00:08:57.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I was going to say
because can it also cause things

00:08:57.471 --> 00:09:01.541 align:middle line:84%
like headache and obviously
digestive dysfunction?

00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:02.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Acidic reaction?

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.911 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It is my experience
that those were coming

00:09:04.911 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
from the contaminants
in the coffee,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.516 align:middle line:90%
not the pure coffee itself.

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.485 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Countless people say,

00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:13.387 align:middle line:84%
"I can't drink coffee,"
and I said, "Try it."

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:15.622 align:middle line:84%
And I'll send them a bag
and they try it and go,

00:09:15.622 --> 00:09:18.125 align:middle line:84%
"I drank the coffee and
there was no heartburn.

00:09:18.125 --> 00:09:18.992 align:middle line:90%
There was no jitter.

00:09:18.992 --> 00:09:20.193 align:middle line:90%
I felt good!"

00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:22.195 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, our
coffee is just brewed, yes.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:23.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:09:23.297 --> 00:09:24.598 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Hunter is
bringing it over to us

00:09:24.598 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and we'll just take
it right here.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:31.071 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll show the
process but what is different

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:32.973 align:middle line:84%
about the Bulletproof
upgraded coffee?

00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:34.941 align:middle line:90%
What... how do you grow with it?

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:36.343 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:40.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: In the fields where
it's grown, how it's harvested

00:09:40.547 --> 00:09:45.852 align:middle line:84%
and specifically when you pick a
coffee cherry, you have a layer

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:49.389 align:middle line:84%
of fruit around that seed and
it's the seed that we want.

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:51.124 align:middle line:84%
So the traditional
way of getting rid

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
of the fruit is you just
let the coffee spoil.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.362 align:middle line:90%
And it's that process

00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:58.131 align:middle line:84%
that introduces the
toxins to the coffee.

00:09:58.131 --> 00:10:00.400 align:middle line:84%
And then after it's spoiled,
you get rid of the outer layer

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.102 align:middle line:84%
of the coffee via
different mechanisms

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:04.237 align:middle line:84%
and then you let it sit
somewhere and dry out.

00:10:04.237 --> 00:10:06.106 align:middle line:84%
And the humidity
levels really matter.

00:10:06.106 --> 00:10:07.374 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these
control things.

00:10:07.374 --> 00:10:09.309 align:middle line:84%
And the coffee people
know about these

00:10:09.309 --> 00:10:12.979 align:middle line:84%
but coffee people are optimizing
for the lowest cost coffee

00:10:12.979 --> 00:10:15.449 align:middle line:84%
or for really good flavor
but they're not optimizing

00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:17.250 align:middle line:90%
for health or human performance.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.785 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
things I care about.

00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:20.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So where
is this coffee grown,

00:10:20.454 --> 00:10:21.555 align:middle line:90%
under what condition?

00:10:21.555 --> 00:10:22.622 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: This is a
Central American coffee.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.024 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:10:24.024 --> 00:10:25.859 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And one of the things
we do is we monitor the local

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:29.429 align:middle line:84%
fungal environment and we
look at the insect environment

00:10:29.429 --> 00:10:32.833 align:middle line:84%
and also, people don't know
this but a damaged coffee cherry

00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:34.968 align:middle line:84%
when it's picked or
one that's less ripe

00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:38.672 align:middle line:84%
or one that's overripe has
different fungal properties.

00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:41.007 align:middle line:84%
So what we're doing is we're
using experienced pickers

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:43.744 align:middle line:84%
to pick the coffee who
harvest only the right ones.

00:10:43.744 --> 00:10:45.212 align:middle line:84%
And you've heard
of cherry picking.

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:46.513 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:47.914 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Well, you have to
pick only the right coffee

00:10:47.914 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
because they don't all ripen at
the same time like grapes do.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.284 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:52.085 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: If coffee grew
like grapes, it'd be amazing.

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:53.420 align:middle line:90%
So every day, you go through

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.022 align:middle line:84%
and you pick just the perfect
ones and things like that.

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:59.159 align:middle line:84%
And what ends up happening is
we say, "Did the process work?"

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.794 align:middle line:90%
Our lab tests come back.

00:11:00.794 --> 00:11:02.062 align:middle line:90%
Okay, this batch is clean.

00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:06.333 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not clean,
it doesn't make the cut.

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.434 align:middle line:90%
So first, we're going to...

00:11:07.434 --> 00:11:09.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Is it high
elevation, organic?

00:11:09.302 --> 00:11:10.637 align:middle line:90%
Obviously organic.

00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:13.006 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Well, in Central
America, you don't see a lot

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:15.575 align:middle line:84%
of organic because it
bankrupts the farmers.

00:11:15.575 --> 00:11:16.610 align:middle line:90%
So ours is passive organic.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:18.011 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: They can
do the labelling.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:20.781 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I understand but I mean,
it does not have all of those.

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:23.283 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: No spraying, no
chemicals, none of that stuff.

00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:26.219 align:middle line:84%
And the whole Bulletproof diet,
the whole Bulletproof lifestyle.

00:11:26.219 --> 00:11:27.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:29.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Like toxins affect
your consciousness way before

00:11:29.055 --> 00:11:31.091 align:middle line:84%
they make you fat or
give you bad skin.

00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:32.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:11:32.325 --> 00:11:33.693 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And I'm all about
making this work as well

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:35.162 align:middle line:84%
as I can because I had so many
problems when I was younger.

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:36.763 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And also you come
from a world where you have

00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:39.398 align:middle line:84%
to have such high performance
but we all need our brains

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:41.535 align:middle line:84%
to be functioning
properly at all ages.

00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:43.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You know, one of
the most important things.

00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:44.571 align:middle line:90%
I have two young children.

00:11:44.571 --> 00:11:46.873 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be a good parent,
you need your brain to function

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:48.608 align:middle line:84%
because when your
two-year-old says no

00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:49.976 align:middle line:90%
for the 10 billionth time,

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:51.578 align:middle line:84%
if your brain isn't working,
you're going to snap.

00:11:51.578 --> 00:11:53.447 align:middle line:84%
And if your brain's working,
you're going to maintain control

00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:55.415 align:middle line:84%
and go, "All right, I'm just
going to take a few breaths.

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:56.416 align:middle line:90%
I can deal with that."

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:58.018 align:middle line:90%
But that's what energy is for;

00:11:58.018 --> 00:11:59.352 align:middle line:84%
it's for how you
treat other people,

00:11:59.352 --> 00:12:00.654 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a job
or something else.

00:12:00.654 --> 00:12:02.689 align:middle line:84%
But that's why it
matters most to me.

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:03.523 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: As you're
making this,

00:12:03.523 --> 00:12:05.225 align:middle line:90%
you also said something to me.

00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:08.094 align:middle line:84%
Your idea and behind
all of this is just

00:12:08.094 --> 00:12:11.164 align:middle line:84%
that if you can create
this beautiful, balanced

00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:14.367 align:middle line:84%
mental clarity then we
have a better civilization.

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:15.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:12:15.502 --> 00:12:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you're
trying to pass that on

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.372 align:middle line:84%
and which is why you do so much
work and just give it away.

00:12:19.372 --> 00:12:22.309 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah, when people's
brains are fully activated,

00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:25.579 align:middle line:84%
just biologically, you have
enough energy all the time then

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.848 align:middle line:84%
you can do things to
help other people.

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:30.951 align:middle line:84%
You can be kinder to
yourself and it works.

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:34.221 align:middle line:84%
The problem I had was that
even though I'm pretty smart,

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:36.523 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't maintain
the brain energy.

00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:38.291 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't keep my
focus all day long.

00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:39.993 align:middle line:90%
And now, I can focus.

00:12:39.993 --> 00:12:42.095 align:middle line:84%
I can run circles around some
of the people working with me

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:45.532 align:middle line:84%
who are 25 until they get
Bulletproof and some of them

00:12:45.532 --> 00:12:47.601 align:middle line:84%
when they get all this stuff
I'm doing and they do it,

00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.336 align:middle line:90%
like if only I had that.

00:12:49.336 --> 00:12:51.037 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you're saying,
wait for me, wait for me.

00:12:51.037 --> 00:12:52.038 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Exactly [laughter].

00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:53.306 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay,
let's see the process

00:12:53.306 --> 00:12:55.642 align:middle line:84%
because this is a really
different way of preparation.

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:56.943 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So the first
thing we do is we brewed some

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:57.744 align:middle line:90%
black coffee.

00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:58.879 align:middle line:90%
We used a French press

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and a French press is a
really good way to do it

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.816 align:middle line:84%
because a French press allows
some of the coffee oils

00:13:02.816 --> 00:13:04.084 align:middle line:90%
to stay in the coffee.

00:13:04.084 --> 00:13:05.318 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Coffee oils
specifically called cafestol

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.024 align:middle line:84%
and kahweol are shown in some
studies to affect inflammation

00:13:11.024 --> 00:13:12.959 align:middle line:84%
in the brain which
is kind of cool.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:14.995 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to
do here is we're going

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:16.529 align:middle line:84%
to pour some coffee
into the blender

00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:18.665 align:middle line:90%
and I'm going to first...

00:13:18.665 --> 00:13:19.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Now where
is that little, yeah.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:21.301 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah, I'm going
to turn this the right way.

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.703 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Here it is.

00:13:23.703 --> 00:13:26.406 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: There we go.

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:29.209 align:middle line:84%
And instead of cream,
I'm going to add some

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:30.644 align:middle line:90%
of that butter like those.

00:13:30.644 --> 00:13:32.846 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you're adding
my very favorite butter of all.

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:35.181 align:middle line:84%
I love butter and
this is Kerrygold.

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:36.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yes.

00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.284 align:middle line:90%
I love the guys at Kerrygold.

00:13:37.284 --> 00:13:39.419 align:middle line:90%
This is grass fed butter.

00:13:39.419 --> 00:13:40.253 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:13:40.253 --> 00:13:41.087 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It's from Ireland.

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:42.222 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: From Ireland, yes.

00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:43.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah and I
eat a lot of this stuff

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.491 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes a half
a stick a day.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.959 align:middle line:84%
If you want your
brain to work well,

00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:48.295 align:middle line:84%
this is really, really
important.

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:51.631 align:middle line:84%
Fat like this really
changes consciousness.

00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: People are
listening thinking, "Oh come on,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.501 align:middle line:90%
a stick of butter a day?

00:13:54.501 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:90%
I'd be as big as a house."

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I was
as big as a house.

00:13:58.038 --> 00:14:02.309 align:middle line:84%
I was a 300-pound young man
and I weigh about 220 right now

00:14:02.309 --> 00:14:03.577 align:middle line:90%
because I'm pretty muscular.

00:14:03.577 --> 00:14:05.078 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, you're
very muscular, yeah.

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah and I work

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.349 align:middle line:84%
out about 15 minutes a
week on the average week.

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:12.552 align:middle line:84%
I'm very about efficiency
and it's a tough workout

00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:15.055 align:middle line:84%
but that's what it
takes to maintain this.

00:14:15.055 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Imagine how much time I save
versus when I used to work

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.225 align:middle line:84%
out an hour-and-a-half a day
when I was fat, every day.

00:14:19.225 --> 00:14:20.427 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't lose the weight.

00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:21.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And were you
eating a stick of butter

00:14:21.828 --> 00:14:23.229 align:middle line:90%
or any of this at that time?

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:25.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: No, back then, I was
on a low-fat, low-calorie diet.

00:14:25.398 --> 00:14:26.232 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh.

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.367 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: And it made me fat

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.668 align:middle line:84%
and it made me even more
tired and more foggy.

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:29.235 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And cranky.

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:29.936 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:30.503 align:middle line:90%
It turns off your brain.

00:14:30.503 --> 00:14:31.738 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:32.639 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So we just added
butter instead of cream.

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the same ingredients.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's about --
it looks like it's a couple

00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:36.042 align:middle line:90%
of tablespoons of butter.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:38.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah, a
couple of tablespoons.

00:14:38.345 --> 00:14:40.113 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this is
a couple of cups for us.

00:14:40.113 --> 00:14:42.515 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yes and here's
the other magic ingredient.

00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:43.249 align:middle line:90%
It's called brain octane oil.

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.384 align:middle line:90%
This is a little travel size.

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.086 align:middle line:84%
We have a big-sized bottle
that I typically use.

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, brain
-- so explain what it is.

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.256 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It's brain
octane oil.

00:14:50.256 --> 00:14:53.493 align:middle line:84%
It is a flavorless oil
extracted from coconut oil.

00:14:53.493 --> 00:14:55.962 align:middle line:90%
It's an 18 X extract.

00:14:55.962 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So it takes 18 tablespoons
of coconut oil

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.834 align:middle line:90%
to get what's in this bottle.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.336 align:middle line:84%
This is the stuff that converts
most quickly in the body

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:05.472 align:middle line:90%
to something called ketones.

00:15:05.472 --> 00:15:08.308 align:middle line:84%
And ketones are the type
of fat that your cells

00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:10.710 align:middle line:84%
in your body can use to make
cellular energy called ATP.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:15.281 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, so the last show
I did, we spoke about using ATP.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:16.216 align:middle line:90%
That's where it's at.

00:15:16.216 --> 00:15:17.183 align:middle line:84%
That's where our
energy comes from.

00:15:17.183 --> 00:15:18.451 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Anything you could do

00:15:18.451 --> 00:15:20.687 align:middle line:84%
to make more ATP will
transform the way you can think.

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:22.489 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And this does?

00:15:22.489 --> 00:15:23.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Here's
the neat thing.

00:15:23.757 --> 00:15:25.859 align:middle line:84%
Glucose which everyone thinks
the brain needs glucose

00:15:25.859 --> 00:15:28.128 align:middle line:90%
which is sugar or carbohydrate.

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:31.798 align:middle line:84%
Glucose takes 26 steps
to turn into ATP.

00:15:31.798 --> 00:15:36.169 align:middle line:84%
This stuff, brain octane oil
takes three steps to turn

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:41.908 align:middle line:84%
into ATP and we just proved this
in a study a little while ago.

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:45.645 align:middle line:84%
And the study showed that the
brain will use ketones before it

00:15:45.645 --> 00:15:46.846 align:middle line:90%
will use glucose.

00:15:46.846 --> 00:15:49.883 align:middle line:84%
That means that this tiny
extract, 4% of what's

00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:53.486 align:middle line:84%
in coconut oil powers the
brain better than glucose,

00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:54.654 align:middle line:90%
at least before glucose.

00:15:54.654 --> 00:15:56.623 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you told
me this off camera.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:58.023 align:middle line:90%
I had never heard this before.

00:15:58.023 --> 00:15:59.392 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It's brand new.

00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's always been
thought that glucose was going

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.729 align:middle line:84%
to be the first to
the pump, so to speak.

00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:05.965 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: We knew that the
brain could run on ketones

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.967 align:middle line:84%
or on glucose but we
always thought ketones were

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.202 align:middle line:90%
backup fuel.

00:16:09.202 --> 00:16:11.304 align:middle line:84%
No one knew the brain
wanted it more than glucose.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.405 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, you would think
of glucose and think

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.808 align:middle line:84%
that with rapid absorption
immediately,

00:16:14.808 --> 00:16:16.109 align:middle line:90%
that's our first thought,

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:19.312 align:middle line:84%
when you're saying this fat
has more rapid absorption

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.714 align:middle line:84%
and more benefits
to the absorption.

00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.049 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah, when
it's in the blood,

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:25.418 align:middle line:84%
the brain will always use it
before it uses the glucose.

00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:28.521 align:middle line:84%
But what if you can
run on two fuels?

00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:29.856 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I do every day

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:31.324 align:middle line:84%
because I have a
very demanding life.

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:34.694 align:middle line:84%
Like there's a million people
a month come to the website.

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:37.263 align:middle line:84%
Every 15 minutes, it's scheduled
and I'm trying to help a lot

00:16:37.263 --> 00:16:39.499 align:middle line:84%
of people and it
could be stressful.

00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:42.502 align:middle line:84%
So to maintain my energy
and focus all day long,

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:45.238 align:middle line:84%
I have ketones and
I have carbohydrates

00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:46.673 align:middle line:90%
in my system all the time.

00:16:46.673 --> 00:16:48.141 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes very
little carbohydrate.

00:16:48.141 --> 00:16:49.209 align:middle line:90%
I don't eat a lot of carbs.

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:51.711 align:middle line:84%
I have a Bulletproof
diet which is...

00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:52.812 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We'll talk
about that in a minute.

00:16:52.812 --> 00:16:54.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Okay.

00:16:54.214 --> 00:16:55.615 align:middle line:84%
It's a low-carb diet but there's
always a little bit of glucose

00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:57.350 align:middle line:90%
in your body or you kind of die.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.687 align:middle line:84%
But what I do do is I make
sure I always have some

00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.322 align:middle line:84%
of this fat every day and I have
it in my coffee when I wake up.

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:05.792 align:middle line:84%
So we have coffee
without toxins.

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:08.128 align:middle line:84%
We have butter which
provides that CLA

00:17:08.128 --> 00:17:09.995 align:middle line:84%
and the butyric acid
for the brain.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:12.098 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
brain octane oil.

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:13.867 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, now what
would happen if someone wanted

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:16.970 align:middle line:84%
to put say honey
in there or xylitol

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.638 align:middle line:90%
or a new one I found about,

00:17:18.638 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
the Lakanto which I love
or stevia or whatnot?

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Stevia is good.

00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:25.979 align:middle line:84%
Xylitol is good if it's
non-GMO, hardwood xylitol.

00:17:25.979 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The birch.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.115 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah, the Chinese
corn xylitol will give you

00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:29.949 align:middle line:90%
serious diarrhea.

00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:31.117 align:middle line:90%
Don't take that.

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:33.219 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, give
us a couple of labels

00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.255 align:middle line:90%
of really good safe xylitol.

00:17:35.255 --> 00:17:37.257 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It just needs to say
North American hardwood on it.

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:38.324 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:17:38.324 --> 00:17:39.125 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: There's
been different labels.

00:17:39.125 --> 00:17:40.193 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay, all right.

00:17:40.193 --> 00:17:41.427 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And then
we take those things

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:43.229 align:middle line:90%
and honey is a bad idea.

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:46.466 align:middle line:84%
It'll taste good and honey
is a decent sweetener

00:17:46.466 --> 00:17:47.800 align:middle line:90%
but you want honey to be raw.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.868 align:middle line:90%
This is hot.

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:49.836 align:middle line:84%
It will not be raw
honey after you do that.

00:17:49.836 --> 00:17:50.637 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, it's
got to be raw.

00:17:50.637 --> 00:17:52.005 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:17:52.005 --> 00:17:53.706 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So you would also
end up getting the fructose then

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:55.942 align:middle line:84%
so that honey after you've
heated and blended it is going

00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:57.844 align:middle line:84%
to be kind of like high
fructose corn syrup.

00:17:57.844 --> 00:17:58.912 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, so
if it's really --

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:00.246 align:middle line:90%
if you want something sweet,

00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:03.316 align:middle line:84%
go with the North
American hardwood xylitol

00:18:03.316 --> 00:18:05.285 align:middle line:90%
or stevia, okay.

00:18:05.285 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Or your other one,
the one that you just said.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.254 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, the Lakanto.

00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:11.057 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And what I'm
going to do is I'm going

00:18:11.057 --> 00:18:13.993 align:middle line:90%
to pulse this a little bit.

00:18:13.993 --> 00:18:17.764 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's looking like
a creamy colored yellow latte.

00:18:17.764 --> 00:18:21.034 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Ideally, you blend
it for about 20 seconds.

00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:22.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:23.469 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I'm going to add
a bit more coffee to this.

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.971 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't want the
blender to send coffee

00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:27.006 align:middle line:90%
into the ceiling here.

00:18:27.006 --> 00:18:28.474 align:middle line:84%
So it should look and
feel like a latte.

00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:29.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, it's looking
just like cream and coffee.

00:18:29.876 --> 00:18:31.311 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I mean, it's the
same as cream and coffee.

00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.245 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It is.

00:18:32.245 --> 00:18:33.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Look at
the ingredients

00:18:33.012 --> 00:18:33.680 align:middle line:90%
on this Kerrygold butter.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.514 align:middle line:90%
It says heavy cream.

00:18:34.514 --> 00:18:35.248 align:middle line:90%
That's all that's in there.

00:18:35.248 --> 00:18:36.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:37.617 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So what
we have is a latte.

00:18:37.617 --> 00:18:39.786 align:middle line:84%
But it has a totally
different performance effect

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:40.720 align:middle line:90%
than a normal latte.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.888 align:middle line:90%
It also tastes delicious.

00:18:41.888 --> 00:18:44.324 align:middle line:84%
It's not like a buttery
kind of gross case.

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:45.658 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Thank you.

00:18:45.658 --> 00:18:48.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It is something
that will fill you up for six

00:18:48.328 --> 00:18:51.598 align:middle line:84%
to eight hours with no
food cravings at all.

00:18:51.598 --> 00:18:55.301 align:middle line:84%
You'll have more energy and
there's tens of thousands

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:58.338 align:middle line:84%
of comments on Facebook
and Twitter about this

00:18:58.338 --> 00:19:00.206 align:middle line:90%
by people I don't know.

00:19:00.206 --> 00:19:01.441 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:02.508 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I don't know
tens of thousands of people.

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:03.776 align:middle line:84%
And they're all saying
the same thing.

00:19:03.776 --> 00:19:05.979 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe my food
cravings were gone in one day.

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe that
I feel so good.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.982 align:middle line:84%
And there are weight loss
effects about it too.

00:19:08.982 --> 00:19:11.284 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, that's
the natural extension.

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:16.222 align:middle line:90%
It is like a...

00:19:16.222 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Creamy latte.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.592 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It tastes
like a creamy latte.

00:19:19.592 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: There's
no grossness at all.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the
funny thing is whatever

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:25.431 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about,
the medium-chain fatty acids

00:19:25.431 --> 00:19:28.368 align:middle line:84%
that you put in here,
you can't taste it.

00:19:28.368 --> 00:19:29.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Believe it or not,

00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:32.472 align:middle line:84%
if you don't add the brain
octane, you get a slightly...

00:19:32.472 --> 00:19:34.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Brain
octane, you call it.

00:19:34.007 --> 00:19:36.342 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah,
because it's not just

00:19:36.342 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:90%
medium-chain triglycerides.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:39.979 align:middle line:90%
Coconut is 62% some MCT's.

00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:43.283 align:middle line:84%
This is just one of them like
it's hyper-extracted compared

00:19:43.283 --> 00:19:45.451 align:middle line:84%
to what you would
normally be able to do.

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:48.321 align:middle line:84%
Even like the normal MCT
oil that you can buy is only

00:19:48.321 --> 00:19:50.723 align:middle line:84%
at six times concentration
of coconut.

00:19:50.723 --> 00:19:53.893 align:middle line:84%
This is 18 times so it's
a very big difference.

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:55.261 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So that's
how'd we'd see it.

00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
If we'd seen it in a health
food store, it'd be called MCT

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.698 align:middle line:90%
but that is a lower grade.

00:19:58.698 --> 00:19:59.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It's not, yeah.

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:00.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's sourced
differently.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.467 align:middle line:90%
It's not what you're using here.

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:03.069 align:middle line:90%
You've gone to some extreme...

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:04.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It's 30%.

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:07.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Measures to create
this, what do you call it?

00:20:07.373 --> 00:20:08.107 align:middle line:90%
Brain octane?

00:20:08.107 --> 00:20:09.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:11.144 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah but can
we find that on your site?

00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:12.645 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's not common.

00:20:12.645 --> 00:20:13.913 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah,
it's on the site.

00:20:13.913 --> 00:20:15.248 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay because we
can't commonly find that.

00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:16.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Not yet.

00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
There are a couple of
grocery stores carrying it

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.419 align:middle line:84%
and a lot more who are
in line to carry it.

00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:21.020 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be able to buy this
in your grocery store sometimes.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.921 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay, brain octane.

00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:23.556 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing it down, all right.

00:20:23.556 --> 00:20:25.191 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It really
makes a difference.

00:20:25.191 --> 00:20:29.595 align:middle line:84%
I used my upgrade MCT oil
which is the six-extract

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.531 align:middle line:90%
of coconut oil for a long time.

00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:34.567 align:middle line:84%
But any kind of MCT oil
has a certain GI effect.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.536 align:middle line:84%
It can cause distress and
even like a little bit

00:20:36.536 --> 00:20:38.204 align:middle line:90%
of scratchiness in the throat.

00:20:38.204 --> 00:20:41.507 align:middle line:84%
The brain octane oil is
a really good innovation

00:20:41.507 --> 00:20:44.243 align:middle line:84%
because you feel it more
up here and it's very easy

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.145 align:middle line:90%
on the digestive tract.

00:20:46.145 --> 00:20:49.282 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: If I go flying out
of here or I'm talking so fast,

00:20:49.282 --> 00:20:52.552 align:middle line:84%
you can't understand
me, you'll know why.

00:20:52.552 --> 00:20:56.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It does really change
the way the coffee affects you

00:20:56.923 --> 00:21:00.626 align:middle line:84%
and having enough energy in your
brain for some people, it's --

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:03.463 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I've had people
describe spiritual experiences

00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:06.432 align:middle line:84%
when they have this
because the capacity

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.401 align:middle line:84%
for having a spiritual
experience is in the brain.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:09.302 align:middle line:90%
It's in our bodies.

00:21:09.302 --> 00:21:11.304 align:middle line:84%
It's part of who
and what we are.

00:21:11.304 --> 00:21:15.675 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have enough
fuel, enough power to have that,

00:21:15.675 --> 00:21:18.578 align:middle line:84%
just like a car out of gas,
it won't go up the hill.

00:21:18.578 --> 00:21:19.746 align:middle line:90%
And it takes a lot of energy.

00:21:19.746 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It increases
the voltage,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.248 align:middle line:90%
the electrical transference

00:21:22.248 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and then it must
have something to do.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.186 align:middle line:84%
Off camera, I said it
must have something to do

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:29.689 align:middle line:84%
with the synapse action
and you said, "No,

00:21:29.689 --> 00:21:31.591 align:middle line:84%
it's actually affecting
the mitochondria."

00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:32.692 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:21:32.692 --> 00:21:33.826 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Which is
-- tell us about that.

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:34.927 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Well,

00:21:34.927 --> 00:21:35.928 align:middle line:84%
the mitochondria are
the little power plants

00:21:35.928 --> 00:21:37.296 align:middle line:90%
in our cells as we like to say.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.699 align:middle line:90%
And their job is to make ATP.

00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:43.269 align:middle line:84%
So they go through this complex
Krebs cycle and it's kind

00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:44.837 align:middle line:84%
of like photosynthesis
but it's what we do

00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:46.806 align:middle line:84%
to make energy instead of
plants where they use light

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.207 align:middle line:90%
and some other things.

00:21:48.207 --> 00:21:51.644 align:middle line:84%
So we do that and then we spit
out this molecule and we're done

00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
with it and then we do something
called the rephosphorylation

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.982 align:middle line:84%
and we recycle our
ATP over and over.

00:21:55.982 --> 00:21:57.683 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazingly complex

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:01.554 align:middle line:84%
like super cool chemical
reaction that happens.

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:04.957 align:middle line:84%
The only problem is you have
to add stuff to it and in order

00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:07.860 align:middle line:84%
to do that, you need
either glucose or ketones.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.662 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the
fastest way to make ketones.

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:11.631 align:middle line:84%
You can also get
ketones by fasting.

00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:13.599 align:middle line:84%
How many spiritual practices
have you fast in a cave?

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:16.269 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's right so that
you can get the mental clarity.

00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:17.437 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: I have done that.

00:22:17.437 --> 00:22:20.106 align:middle line:84%
I fasted in a cave outside
Sedona for four days

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:22.041 align:middle line:90%
and even like some of the...

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:23.209 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Shaman's
Cave, by chance?

00:22:23.209 --> 00:22:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It was indeed.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.678 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was called
First Woman's Cave.

00:22:25.678 --> 00:22:27.079 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, interesting.

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:28.948 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: But I'm sure that's
the one you're talking about.

00:22:28.948 --> 00:22:30.016 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:32.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And it was
a good experience.

00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:36.522 align:middle line:84%
You can get the benefits of
fasting, the ketone benefits

00:22:36.522 --> 00:22:38.791 align:middle line:84%
of that and the clarity
and the power it provides

00:22:38.791 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:84%
by adding brain octane
oil to your food

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.462 align:middle line:90%
or to your coffee instead

00:22:42.462 --> 00:22:45.498 align:middle line:84%
of by basically not
eating for a while.

00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:46.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well now,
if someone doesn't want

00:22:46.532 --> 00:22:48.401 align:middle line:84%
to drink coffee for
whatever reason.

00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:50.236 align:middle line:90%
Say they hate coffee.

00:22:50.236 --> 00:22:51.604 align:middle line:90%
I saw you putting that.

00:22:51.604 --> 00:22:54.607 align:middle line:84%
You were drizzling a bit of it
on your vegetables at lunch.

00:22:54.607 --> 00:22:56.876 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I make salad
dressings with it all the time.

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:59.378 align:middle line:84%
You can take olive oil which
is relatively inflammatory.

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Olive oil is good
for you but too much

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.548 align:middle line:84%
of it gives you a
lot of omega 6.

00:23:02.548 --> 00:23:03.883 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:05.318 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: If you take like
two tablespoons of olive oil

00:23:05.318 --> 00:23:09.422 align:middle line:84%
and then put the rest of it,
brain octane and it tastes just

00:23:09.422 --> 00:23:12.091 align:middle line:84%
like olive oil because the
brain octane's a neutral flavor.

00:23:12.091 --> 00:23:14.494 align:middle line:84%
And get this, my
favorite use for this,

00:23:14.494 --> 00:23:19.532 align:middle line:84%
aside from making Bulletproof
coffee is you take sushi.

00:23:19.532 --> 00:23:21.901 align:middle line:84%
Go to the sushi place and
drizzle this on the sushi.

00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:23.136 align:middle line:90%
I've done this in Japan.

00:23:23.136 --> 00:23:25.004 align:middle line:84%
I've done this in Hawaii
where the sushi masters live

00:23:25.004 --> 00:23:28.007 align:middle line:84%
and they look at me like,
"It tastes really good."

00:23:28.007 --> 00:23:29.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Laughter].

00:23:29.108 --> 00:23:31.477 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It's outside
the sushi tradition

00:23:31.477 --> 00:23:32.712 align:middle line:90%
but because it has no flavor,

00:23:32.712 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
it activates the fat
receptors in your taste buds.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:23:35.815 --> 00:23:36.883 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It also fills
you up so you don't have

00:23:36.883 --> 00:23:38.184 align:middle line:84%
to eat $200 worth of
sushi to feel full.

00:23:38.184 --> 00:23:38.684 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: There you go.

00:23:38.684 --> 00:23:40.086 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:41.387 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So every time I eat
sushi, I drizzle this on there

00:23:41.387 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:84%
and the rice just
explodes in flavor.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.424 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, that
makes total sense.

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:48.995 align:middle line:84%
And so this is essentially
medium-chain fatty acids.

00:23:48.995 --> 00:23:51.097 align:middle line:90%
Explain why medium-chain?

00:23:51.097 --> 00:23:52.698 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Well,
there's different links

00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:53.933 align:middle line:90%
of saturated fats.

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.635 align:middle line:90%
And there's very long ones.

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:58.371 align:middle line:84%
In fact like peanut oil has one
that is so long they don't fit

00:23:58.371 --> 00:23:59.639 align:middle line:84%
in your cell membranes
and that's one

00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:90%
of the reasons that...

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.908 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Everyone's
allergic to peanuts.

00:24:01.908 --> 00:24:03.109 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah and
peanuts are associated

00:24:03.109 --> 00:24:04.844 align:middle line:84%
with Alzheimer's disease
and things like that,

00:24:04.844 --> 00:24:07.914 align:middle line:84%
as well as the mold toxins
that are well known in peanuts.

00:24:07.914 --> 00:24:11.083 align:middle line:84%
And then as you get lower
and lower down the link

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:13.252 align:middle line:84%
of the fatty acid chains,
different things happen.

00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:15.121 align:middle line:84%
Coconut oil itself is
pretty good for you.

00:24:15.121 --> 00:24:16.389 align:middle line:90%
I like coconut oil.

00:24:16.389 --> 00:24:19.525 align:middle line:84%
It's 62% medium-chain
fatty acids.

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:22.495 align:middle line:84%
But there's four different
links of fatty acids

00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:25.731 align:middle line:84%
and what we have determined
is that the shorter the link

00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:29.135 align:middle line:84%
of the fatty acid for
saturated fat, the better it is

00:24:29.135 --> 00:24:32.371 align:middle line:84%
for this mental function, the
clarity that we're targeting.

00:24:32.371 --> 00:24:35.374 align:middle line:84%
So you start out with
coconut oil at 62%.

00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:37.577 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you get down to what
you can buy in some stores.

00:24:37.577 --> 00:24:41.747 align:middle line:84%
There's low-grade like
non-pharmaceutical grade sort

00:24:41.747 --> 00:24:46.252 align:middle line:84%
of less pure MCT oil that
you can buy but it's 15%

00:24:46.252 --> 00:24:48.054 align:middle line:90%
of what's in the coconut oil.

00:24:48.054 --> 00:24:49.422 align:middle line:90%
It's the lower two.

00:24:49.422 --> 00:24:51.624 align:middle line:84%
And what I found with the
brain octane is when I get rid

00:24:51.624 --> 00:24:55.828 align:middle line:84%
of the longer one, I have just
the most rare fatty acid in all

00:24:55.828 --> 00:25:00.032 align:middle line:84%
of the coconut which is
based on C8, we call it.

00:25:00.032 --> 00:25:02.835 align:middle line:84%
What happens is you get
a lot more mental clarity

00:25:02.835 --> 00:25:04.971 align:middle line:84%
because there's no way I
could eat 18 tablespoons

00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:05.571 align:middle line:90%
of coconut oil.

00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:06.205 align:middle line:90%
I'd get sick.

00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:07.306 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I know.

00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:08.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: But I can
easily do a tablespoon

00:25:08.107 --> 00:25:09.575 align:middle line:90%
or I can do four tablespoons

00:25:09.575 --> 00:25:11.143 align:middle line:84%
of this throughout the
day and sometimes I do.

00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:12.612 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend
this for everyone.

00:25:12.612 --> 00:25:13.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Laughter] No.

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:14.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You can
see how you do on it.

00:25:14.614 --> 00:25:16.182 align:middle line:90%
In fact, some people start

00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:18.918 align:middle line:84%
out with just a half a
teaspoon or a teaspoon.

00:25:18.918 --> 00:25:21.988 align:middle line:84%
If you are older, I
actually recommend you start

00:25:21.988 --> 00:25:23.823 align:middle line:84%
out with a teaspoon because a
tablespoon is probably going

00:25:23.823 --> 00:25:26.092 align:middle line:84%
to be so much energy, you don't
know what to do with that.

00:25:26.092 --> 00:25:29.095 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So to start with,
just a half-a-teaspoon.

00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:31.764 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah or maybe a
teaspoon but if you're concerned

00:25:31.764 --> 00:25:33.399 align:middle line:84%
or you have diarrhea
problems or something, yeah.

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:34.734 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah,
you build up, okay.

00:25:34.734 --> 00:25:37.036 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah and most people
end up around a tablespoon

00:25:37.036 --> 00:25:38.537 align:middle line:90%
in their coffee in the morning.

00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:41.207 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients
does more than 20

00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:42.708 align:middle line:84%
and I think that's
a little crazy.

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:44.377 align:middle line:90%
I've never had that much myself.

00:25:44.377 --> 00:25:46.379 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know what the
effects of that would be.

00:25:46.379 --> 00:25:47.713 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:25:47.713 --> 00:25:48.881 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Because no human
on earth has ever been able

00:25:48.881 --> 00:25:50.416 align:middle line:84%
to eat whatever 20
times 18 is

00:25:50.416 --> 00:25:52.618 align:middle line:90%
in that much coconut oil.

00:25:52.618 --> 00:25:56.155 align:middle line:84%
So generally, a tablespoon a day
is going to give you the kind

00:25:56.155 --> 00:25:59.492 align:middle line:84%
of energy that you get from
fasting, that extra clarity.

00:25:59.492 --> 00:26:01.227 align:middle line:84%
I live in that state
because I have not gone

00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
without brain octane oil
or the upgraded MCT oil

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.333 align:middle line:84%
that we manufacture
for years now.

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:10.836 align:middle line:84%
It is like a major
part of what keeps me

00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:12.505 align:middle line:90%
in the state that I'm in.

00:26:12.505 --> 00:26:15.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you're
obviously no longer overweight.

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:16.442 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer low energy.

00:26:16.442 --> 00:26:18.878 align:middle line:84%
You have good musculature
on your body

00:26:18.878 --> 00:26:22.615 align:middle line:84%
and you know the saying that has
gone around for, I don't know,

00:26:22.615 --> 00:26:24.216 align:middle line:90%
decades anyway on dieting

00:26:24.216 --> 00:26:27.119 align:middle line:84%
and all the diet
plans, fat begets fat.

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And personally, I never bought
that because if I don't eat fat

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.726 align:middle line:84%
in a decent amount of
it, I don't feel well.

00:26:33.726 --> 00:26:34.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:35.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: My brain
doesn't work.

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.663 align:middle line:84%
Nothing feels well
and what I'm learning

00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:40.232 align:middle line:84%
from you is another
refined level

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:43.035 align:middle line:84%
of information regarding
the quality of those fats.

00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:46.472 align:middle line:84%
Why is that statement,
fat begets fat, not true?

00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:48.741 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, you're a walking
example and all these people,

00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:52.445 align:middle line:84%
hundreds, well thousands that
write in that have lost weight.

00:26:52.445 --> 00:26:53.946 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: What an
amazing question.

00:26:53.946 --> 00:26:56.182 align:middle line:84%
I don't agree all
that it's not true.

00:26:56.182 --> 00:26:57.783 align:middle line:90%
Fat does beget fat.

00:26:57.783 --> 00:26:59.685 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay so
what's going on here?

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:02.354 align:middle line:84%
You need a lot of fat and
you're maintaining your weight

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:03.489 align:middle line:90%
and people are losing weight.

00:27:03.489 --> 00:27:04.857 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:27:04.857 --> 00:27:06.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: This is the core
part of the Bulletproof diet.

00:27:06.325 --> 00:27:07.727 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:27:07.727 --> 00:27:09.128 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Some fat makes you
fat and some fat makes you thin.

00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:10.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:27:10.463 --> 00:27:12.064 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: If it was only so
simple, say protein is good.

00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Fat is bad and carbs are
good if they're fibrous,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.001 align:middle line:90%
it could be so simple.

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I think you're
going to say something

00:27:17.203 --> 00:27:19.638 align:middle line:84%
like this is better than
ice cream fat [laughter].

00:27:19.638 --> 00:27:22.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Well, if you pour
this into an ice cream maker,

00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:23.275 align:middle line:84%
what would you think
would happen?

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:24.243 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You'd have
ice cream [laughter]?

00:27:24.243 --> 00:27:25.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Add a
couple of eggs to it

00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:26.178 align:middle line:90%
and you've got coffee ice cream

00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:27.413 align:middle line:84%
like this essentially
is melted ice cream.

00:27:27.413 --> 00:27:28.514 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's the
way it's normally made.

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:30.416 align:middle line:84%
So okay, let's talk
about the quality of fat

00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:32.818 align:middle line:84%
and why this fat is
actually shutting

00:27:32.818 --> 00:27:35.154 align:middle line:84%
down something that
makes you fat.

00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:37.823 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: When you eat
saturated fat that's undamaged,

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:40.693 align:middle line:84%
un-oxidized, unhydrogenated
and all the bad things

00:27:40.693 --> 00:27:44.597 align:middle line:84%
that industrial food companies
will do to fats, your body says,

00:27:44.597 --> 00:27:46.532 align:middle line:90%
"Hmm, what do I do with this?

00:27:46.532 --> 00:27:48.834 align:middle line:90%
I make hormones out of it."

00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:52.037 align:middle line:84%
Like people don't know
cholesterol is the building

00:27:52.037 --> 00:27:55.274 align:middle line:84%
block for testosterone
and estrogen and cortisol

00:27:55.274 --> 00:27:58.344 align:middle line:84%
and all the other hormones that
are part of making us function.

00:27:58.344 --> 00:28:02.882 align:middle line:84%
Your cell membranes require fat
and if you only eat seed oils

00:28:02.882 --> 00:28:05.718 align:middle line:84%
like canola and soy that are
a major part of your diet,

00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:09.622 align:middle line:84%
you actually will start to build
cell membranes out of those.

00:28:09.622 --> 00:28:14.827 align:middle line:84%
These do not allow flexibility
and because they oxidize easily,

00:28:14.827 --> 00:28:17.129 align:middle line:84%
these polyunsaturated fats,
the ones we've been sold

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:18.631 align:middle line:84%
for the last 30 years
as being healthy

00:28:18.631 --> 00:28:21.033 align:middle line:84%
that no one could ever
concentrate without chemicals.

00:28:21.033 --> 00:28:21.867 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Those fats,

00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:24.570 align:middle line:84%
the reason they're called
polyunsaturated is they have

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.573 align:middle line:84%
these basically arms sticking
out of them that can oxidize,

00:28:27.573 --> 00:28:30.009 align:middle line:90%
places for oxygen to stay.

00:28:30.009 --> 00:28:33.012 align:middle line:84%
Every time oxygen sticks, they
form free radicals in the body

00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:34.213 align:middle line:90%
and they keep forming that.

00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:36.549 align:middle line:84%
so your cell membranes
which are drops of fat --

00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:90%
that's all they are --

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.186 align:middle line:84%
whoa, suddenly they're made
out of poor quality fats

00:28:40.186 --> 00:28:42.021 align:middle line:84%
that are spitting
out free radicals.

00:28:42.021 --> 00:28:43.656 align:middle line:90%
When you eat like I do,

00:28:43.656 --> 00:28:46.458 align:middle line:84%
70% of my calories
are from healthy fats.

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:48.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: When I read that
[laughter], I was researching,

00:28:48.928 --> 00:28:51.597 align:middle line:84%
I thought that's
my kind of diet.

00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:52.398 align:middle line:90%
I thought, "My God!

00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:54.500 align:middle line:90%
You're kidding, 70%!"

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.870 align:middle line:84%
You're the only person I've
interviewed or even researched

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.272 align:middle line:90%
that has put that out there.

00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Get this.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.908 align:middle line:84%
Vegetables only exist
to absorb butter.

00:29:02.908 --> 00:29:04.176 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced of that.

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:06.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's what I
believe but I thought I was...

00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:07.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: They evolved.

00:29:07.379 --> 00:29:08.747 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What [laughter]?

00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:13.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: When you do this,
you feel like 20 years younger.

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:16.689 align:middle line:84%
I literally perform better
now than I did when I was 20.

00:29:16.689 --> 00:29:18.257 align:middle line:90%
I had so much going on.

00:29:18.257 --> 00:29:22.828 align:middle line:84%
I had chronic fatigue, Lyme
disease, fibromyalgia, ADD,

00:29:22.828 --> 00:29:26.198 align:middle line:84%
all those things, arthritis
when I was 14 in my knees.

00:29:26.198 --> 00:29:29.168 align:middle line:84%
And for me to be able to go
through an intense brain fog

00:29:29.168 --> 00:29:31.370 align:middle line:84%
in my mid-20's and
to be able to be

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.305 align:middle line:84%
like a really successful
executive,

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:36.008 align:middle line:90%
I'm amazingly grateful for that.

00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:40.346 align:middle line:84%
And if I didn't have the 70%
fat diet, I would melt down.

00:29:40.346 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you right now.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.749 align:middle line:84%
It's what keeps me in
this state that I'm in.

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:47.453 align:middle line:84%
With that said, if I did
70% canola oil, soybean oil

00:29:47.453 --> 00:29:50.456 align:middle line:84%
or even olive oil, I would
not do well on that either

00:29:50.456 --> 00:29:52.825 align:middle line:84%
because soon, my
hormones wouldn't be made

00:29:52.825 --> 00:29:54.226 align:middle line:90%
of the right stuff.

00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:57.129 align:middle line:84%
My cell membranes would start
being the poor functioning ones.

00:29:57.129 --> 00:29:59.098 align:middle line:84%
So for a long time, when
I started this diet,

00:29:59.098 --> 00:30:03.235 align:middle line:84%
I would eat masses of butter,
way more than two tablespoons

00:30:03.235 --> 00:30:05.437 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, sometimes
six or eight tablespoons.

00:30:05.437 --> 00:30:06.872 align:middle line:90%
And I craved it.

00:30:06.872 --> 00:30:08.107 align:middle line:90%
And after a couple of years

00:30:08.107 --> 00:30:10.576 align:middle line:84%
after my whole body made
cell membranes differently,

00:30:10.576 --> 00:30:12.044 align:middle line:90%
I stopped craving the butter

00:30:12.044 --> 00:30:13.846 align:middle line:84%
and I just have a
couple of tablespoons.

00:30:13.846 --> 00:30:15.648 align:middle line:90%
But it is fuel for the brain.

00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:18.150 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans have known
it for a long time.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.852 align:middle line:84%
Ayurvedic medicine
knows it with ghee.

00:30:19.852 --> 00:30:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, with
ghee on everything.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.655 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And how
do we forget this?

00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:24.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well and also,
I think more recently,

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:29.528 align:middle line:84%
one of the proponents of this
was the Western Price Foundation

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:30.396 align:middle line:90%
Sally Fallon.

00:30:30.396 --> 00:30:31.397 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: I love those guys.

00:30:31.397 --> 00:30:32.698 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And the long term --

00:30:32.698 --> 00:30:34.466 align:middle line:84%
was it the Farmington
or Framington diet?

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:35.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Framington, yeah.

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:37.236 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That they studied for
so long and found that people

00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:40.673 align:middle line:84%
that were eating this kind of
diet with proteins and good,

00:30:40.673 --> 00:30:43.075 align:middle line:90%
again grass-fed natural organic,

00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:47.212 align:middle line:84%
just often raw fats actually
were healthier than those

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:51.016 align:middle line:84%
who were going on all of these
dozens of different fad habits,

00:30:51.016 --> 00:30:53.852 align:middle line:84%
going lighter and lighter,
more vegetables, less of this

00:30:53.852 --> 00:30:56.522 align:middle line:84%
and that, well like
vegetables, more carbs.

00:30:56.522 --> 00:30:58.924 align:middle line:84%
That was really detrimental
in mass to us.

00:30:58.924 --> 00:31:00.826 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: When I
was a raw vegan,

00:31:00.826 --> 00:31:03.462 align:middle line:84%
I was that for months
and months.

00:31:03.462 --> 00:31:07.466 align:middle line:84%
I lost some weight but I started
to get really serious brain

00:31:07.466 --> 00:31:09.034 align:middle line:84%
problems, and I developed
a lot of food allergies.

00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:10.235 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of the people

00:31:10.235 --> 00:31:12.004 align:middle line:84%
in the Bulletproof
Executive website who've been

00:31:12.004 --> 00:31:14.173 align:middle line:84%
through that experienced
the same thing,

00:31:14.173 --> 00:31:15.975 align:middle line:84%
even some of the guests
on the podcast have come

00:31:15.975 --> 00:31:18.077 align:middle line:84%
on like famous vegans
who had to give it up

00:31:18.077 --> 00:31:20.946 align:middle line:84%
and started eating lots
of butter and raw fats.

00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:22.815 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, I was a
vegetarian 20 years and I had

00:31:22.815 --> 00:31:25.884 align:middle line:84%
to give it up because my body
was craving certain amino acids

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:27.853 align:middle line:90%
and more animal fats.

00:31:27.853 --> 00:31:30.089 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Let's talk about
amino acids for a minute.

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:31.223 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned Western A. Price.

00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:32.891 align:middle line:90%
I'm a huge fan of his research.

00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:35.294 align:middle line:84%
One of the most important
proteins that we don't get

00:31:35.294 --> 00:31:37.596 align:middle line:90%
in our diet at all is collagen

00:31:37.596 --> 00:31:40.566 align:middle line:84%
because you notice your
grandmother probably made

00:31:40.566 --> 00:31:42.368 align:middle line:90%
like bone soup, bone broth?

00:31:42.368 --> 00:31:43.502 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:44.636 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And this is
big among Paleo dieters.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:45.971 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, marrow.

00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah, marrow and
just like boiling the bones

00:31:48.173 --> 00:31:49.274 align:middle line:90%
and getting like Jell-O.

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:50.476 align:middle line:90%
We don't eat Jell-O anymore.

00:31:50.476 --> 00:31:51.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:52.578 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It's uncommon.

00:31:52.578 --> 00:31:55.014 align:middle line:84%
Well, I decided I wanted to
get more of this in my body.

00:31:55.014 --> 00:31:56.882 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have time
and I travel too much

00:31:56.882 --> 00:31:59.084 align:middle line:90%
to get bone soup and all that.

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:02.788 align:middle line:84%
So I came up with a grass-fed
hydrolyzed collagen product.

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:06.191 align:middle line:84%
So we take enzymes and break
collagen down into tiny little

00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:07.893 align:middle line:90%
like flavorless particles.

00:32:07.893 --> 00:32:09.395 align:middle line:90%
So it's a loose protein powder.

00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:10.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So this is --

00:32:10.462 --> 00:32:11.497 align:middle line:84%
okay, yeah so it's
collagen protein powder

00:32:11.497 --> 00:32:14.166 align:middle line:90%
from pasture-raised happy cows.

00:32:14.166 --> 00:32:16.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Right and so I
don't eat industrial meat.

00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:18.070 align:middle line:90%
It is not good for your brain.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.873 align:middle line:84%
You will get messed up if
you eat the typical chicken

00:32:20.873 --> 00:32:23.609 align:middle line:84%
and particularly beef that you
can buy at the grocery store.

00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.413 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Non-organic meat in
the U.S. aside from antibiotics

00:32:27.413 --> 00:32:29.214 align:middle line:84%
and other toxins
that accumulate...

00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:30.616 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Steroids.

00:32:30.616 --> 00:32:32.384 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: They inject it with
something called ractopamine.

00:32:32.384 --> 00:32:33.552 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What's that?

00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:34.853 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It's adrenal hormone

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:37.056 align:middle line:84%
and it's an agonist
for the adrenals.

00:32:37.056 --> 00:32:40.092 align:middle line:84%
The cow will gain 30
pounds of extra muscle

00:32:40.092 --> 00:32:42.428 align:middle line:90%
in the last 60 days of life.

00:32:42.428 --> 00:32:45.431 align:middle line:84%
The problem is ractopamine
stays in the meat

00:32:45.431 --> 00:32:48.834 align:middle line:84%
and when you take it, it raises
anxiety and stress enormously.

00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:50.869 align:middle line:84%
It's banned in most
countries, even in Russia

00:32:50.869 --> 00:32:52.337 align:middle line:84%
but in the U.S.,
they still use it.

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:53.172 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Whoa!

00:32:53.172 --> 00:32:53.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: It's a big problem.

00:32:53.906 --> 00:32:55.307 align:middle line:90%
So here's the trick

00:32:55.307 --> 00:32:57.443 align:middle line:84%
to get healthy grass-fed
protein in collagen.

00:32:57.443 --> 00:33:02.314 align:middle line:84%
Hair, skin, even your bones, the
matrix around which the calcium

00:33:02.314 --> 00:33:05.150 align:middle line:84%
and magnesium sticks is
made out of collagen.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.152 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The collagen
producing beauty treatments

00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:09.822 align:middle line:84%
that women pay thousands
of dollars for those

00:33:09.822 --> 00:33:11.523 align:middle line:84%
but actually you have
create it on the inside.

00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:12.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: You have to eat it.

00:33:12.458 --> 00:33:13.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:16.462 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So what I do
is I just take this stuff

00:33:16.462 --> 00:33:18.464 align:middle line:84%
and I add it to the
coffee when I want

00:33:18.464 --> 00:33:19.731 align:middle line:90%
to have protein in the morning.

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:22.067 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't have a flavor.

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:24.069 align:middle line:84%
It's very neutral and
it doesn't gelatinize

00:33:24.069 --> 00:33:26.205 align:middle line:84%
like normal Jell-O would
make like coffee Jell-O.

00:33:26.205 --> 00:33:27.873 align:middle line:84%
It's not that pleasant
unless you refrigerate it.

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:28.841 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Does it just mix in?

00:33:28.841 --> 00:33:29.875 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It mixes
in painlessly.

00:33:29.875 --> 00:33:31.009 align:middle line:90%
In fact...

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:31.677 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Should we do a remix?

00:33:31.677 --> 00:33:32.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:33.345 align:middle line:90%
We'll just mix in some of this.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:34.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Or just do a new one?

00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:35.214 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You have
some more coffee.

00:33:35.214 --> 00:33:36.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay, sure why not?

00:33:36.048 --> 00:33:37.216 align:middle line:90%
We're having fun.

00:33:37.216 --> 00:33:38.417 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I do this
about half of the morning.

00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:40.219 align:middle line:84%
The other mornings, I
just have straight coffee

00:33:40.219 --> 00:33:41.687 align:middle line:90%
and a Bulletproof coffee recipe.

00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:45.457 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to be
hungry for hours and hours.

00:33:45.457 --> 00:33:46.625 align:middle line:84%
If you add protein
in the morning,

00:33:46.625 --> 00:33:48.260 align:middle line:84%
you'll be hungry two
hours sooner because just

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.028 align:middle line:84%
that by itself is
more satiating.

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:51.897 align:middle line:84%
So I add a couple
tablespoons of this.

00:33:51.897 --> 00:33:54.900 align:middle line:84%
If you want the 30 grams
of protein in the morning

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.568 align:middle line:84%
that you would typically
take if you were trying

00:33:56.568 --> 00:33:59.538 align:middle line:84%
to reset your leptin or if
you're significantly overweight.

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:01.240 align:middle line:84%
For a month, you should
do protein every morning

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.774 align:middle line:84%
with your coffee until
your body gets used to it.

00:34:02.774 --> 00:34:04.109 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And yet every diet,

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:06.912 align:middle line:84%
virtually every diet
says eliminate coffee.

00:34:06.912 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:90%
Now why do they say that?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.850 align:middle line:84%
What is the thinking -- what
is that line of thinking about?

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:14.753 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: There's a
puritanical attitude in the U.S.

00:34:14.753 --> 00:34:18.055 align:middle line:84%
about coffee somehow is
vaguely related to alcohol.

00:34:18.055 --> 00:34:22.161 align:middle line:84%
It has more antioxidants in it
than red wine like a lot more.

00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:23.829 align:middle line:84%
More than chocolate,
the number source

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:25.898 align:middle line:84%
of antioxidants in
the American diet.

00:34:25.898 --> 00:34:28.066 align:middle line:84%
But bad coffee does
have bad effects.

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:30.836 align:middle line:84%
Instant coffee is some of the
most toxic coffee you can get.

00:34:30.836 --> 00:34:33.872 align:middle line:84%
Low quality coffee does have
negative health impacts.

00:34:33.872 --> 00:34:34.972 align:middle line:90%
That's part of it.

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:38.043 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind of
this puritanical thing.

00:34:38.043 --> 00:34:40.144 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
acid-alkaline people

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:44.082 align:middle line:84%
who will tell you, "Oh, you
know, coffee makes you acidic."

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:46.651 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This isn't making
my stomach acidic at all.

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:47.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: No, it doesn't.

00:34:47.653 --> 00:34:50.022 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's what
toxins do to you.

00:34:50.022 --> 00:34:52.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Interesting and
I'm also starting to notice

00:34:52.391 --> 00:34:55.961 align:middle line:84%
on the temporals, on my
temporal lobes in particular,

00:34:55.961 --> 00:34:59.331 align:middle line:84%
right along here and a little
bit to the frontal activity.

00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:00.632 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: They're waking up?

00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:02.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, there's a
very interesting enlivening

00:35:02.668 --> 00:35:03.802 align:middle line:90%
feeling happening.

00:35:03.802 --> 00:35:06.638 align:middle line:84%
Are the temporal lobes
normally affected by it?

00:35:06.638 --> 00:35:08.307 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: The whole
brain gets more energy.

00:35:08.307 --> 00:35:09.441 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's very
interesting.

00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.442 align:middle line:90%
It's nice.

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:11.777 align:middle line:90%
This is a good feeling.

00:35:11.777 --> 00:35:14.847 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Your job as an
animal like your body's job is

00:35:14.847 --> 00:35:16.248 align:middle line:90%
to keep the body alive.

00:35:16.248 --> 00:35:17.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:35:17.583 --> 00:35:18.884 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So number one most
important reptilian brain,

00:35:18.884 --> 00:35:20.219 align:middle line:90%
the brainstem.

00:35:20.219 --> 00:35:22.588 align:middle line:84%
The number two most important,
mammalian brain and that's

00:35:22.588 --> 00:35:23.622 align:middle line:90%
where the automated kind

00:35:23.622 --> 00:35:25.224 align:middle line:84%
of protection systems
come into play.

00:35:25.224 --> 00:35:26.558 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:35:26.558 --> 00:35:28.327 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Like have you ever
seen a deer in the forest?

00:35:28.327 --> 00:35:30.062 align:middle line:90%
If you make a sound, it freezes.

00:35:30.062 --> 00:35:31.163 align:middle line:84%
You make another
sound, it runs away.

00:35:31.163 --> 00:35:31.797 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't think.

00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:32.397 align:middle line:90%
Should I run?

00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:33.699 align:middle line:90%
It just runs.

00:35:33.699 --> 00:35:35.267 align:middle line:84%
The part of your body, your
fright or flight response,

00:35:35.267 --> 00:35:38.036 align:middle line:84%
your sympathetic nervous
system, that comes next.

00:35:38.036 --> 00:35:41.006 align:middle line:84%
So you get reptile,
mammal and then human

00:35:41.006 --> 00:35:43.308 align:middle line:84%
and the energy flows
first to reptile then

00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:44.810 align:middle line:90%
to mammal then to human.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.245 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Which is
your parasympathetic

00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:48.847 align:middle line:84%
which you must have to
balance the sympathetic.

00:35:48.847 --> 00:35:50.215 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:35:50.215 --> 00:35:52.751 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you have that
beautiful natural energy running

00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:54.953 align:middle line:84%
through your nervous system
and that's what this is doing?

00:35:54.953 --> 00:35:56.188 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: What if
you're out of energy

00:35:56.188 --> 00:35:58.090 align:middle line:84%
and you only have enough
energy to do the reptilian?

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:58.924 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Sure.

00:35:58.924 --> 00:35:59.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: And the mammalian...

00:35:59.992 --> 00:36:01.093 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That's
where most of us live.

00:36:01.093 --> 00:36:01.927 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You're run
on autopilot, right?

00:36:01.927 --> 00:36:03.128 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:36:03.128 --> 00:36:04.496 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Well, I don't
want to run on autopilot.

00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.431 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I train myself
with all sorts of technologies,

00:36:06.431 --> 00:36:09.434 align:middle line:84%
the biohacking part of what
I do in order to be able

00:36:09.434 --> 00:36:12.037 align:middle line:84%
to have enough energy to
always have my frontals,

00:36:12.037 --> 00:36:13.905 align:middle line:84%
my pre-frontal cortex,
the human part.

00:36:13.905 --> 00:36:15.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I want that
running all the time.

00:36:16.008 --> 00:36:17.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And this,
I can feel it.

00:36:17.075 --> 00:36:19.311 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, it's
coming around the side

00:36:19.311 --> 00:36:22.347 align:middle line:84%
and into the front
side of the frontals.

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:28.654 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, it's kind of
mellow but very focused

00:36:28.654 --> 00:36:30.355 align:middle line:90%
and clear at the same time.

00:36:30.355 --> 00:36:31.723 align:middle line:84%
That's what it feels
like which I guess

00:36:31.723 --> 00:36:33.558 align:middle line:84%
for meditation is
your ideal state.

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:36.194 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Or what if you
had ADD and you took it?

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:36.762 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:36:36.762 --> 00:36:37.963 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Wow!

00:36:37.963 --> 00:36:40.666 align:middle line:84%
So it can have some strong
effects for meditation

00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.467 align:middle line:84%
because you don't lose
your train of thought.

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:43.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:36:43.769 --> 00:36:45.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I've done a lot
of computer-aided meditation

00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:47.372 align:middle line:84%
where we're looking at
your brain to make it

00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:48.940 align:middle line:90%
like an advanced Zen monk.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.709 align:middle line:84%
It's something called
40 Years of Zen Training

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:54.646 align:middle line:84%
where you spend huge amounts
of energy just learning how

00:36:54.646 --> 00:36:56.682 align:middle line:84%
to make more alpha waves
in the front of the brain

00:36:56.682 --> 00:36:59.151 align:middle line:84%
and to do things that
normally take many,

00:36:59.151 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:90%
many years to accomplish.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.323 align:middle line:84%
When I bring my coaching class,
my executive coaching class

00:37:04.323 --> 00:37:05.824 align:middle line:84%
like CEO's and hedge
fund managers and all

00:37:05.824 --> 00:37:09.528 align:middle line:84%
that through the training
with me, if they're using --

00:37:09.528 --> 00:37:11.430 align:middle line:84%
we don't use the
coffee during that time

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.298 align:middle line:84%
because you actually
don't want to be

00:37:13.298 --> 00:37:14.900 align:middle line:84%
on coffee during this
form of training.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.001 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:37:16.001 --> 00:37:17.235 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: But we take
the brain octane oil

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:20.072 align:middle line:84%
and we take the upgraded
oil that we make and butter,

00:37:20.072 --> 00:37:22.974 align:middle line:84%
tons of it and we can do twice
as much training when we're

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:25.744 align:middle line:84%
on the brain octane oil before
the brain gets exhausted.

00:37:25.744 --> 00:37:26.511 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:27.479 align:middle line:90%
And the muscles like fat.

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:28.313 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Oh, the
whole body does.

00:37:28.313 --> 00:37:29.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They need the fat.

00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:30.849 align:middle line:84%
When you're going into
that kind of performance,

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:32.584 align:middle line:84%
not mental performance but
physical performance training

00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:34.486 align:middle line:90%
as well, the body likes fat.

00:37:34.486 --> 00:37:40.192 align:middle line:84%
Even though muscle builders seem
to, tend to dehydrate the body

00:37:40.192 --> 00:37:43.462 align:middle line:84%
and eliminate the fats for
competition to get that cut look

00:37:43.462 --> 00:37:45.397 align:middle line:90%
but for a natural kind of --

00:37:45.397 --> 00:37:47.232 align:middle line:84%
just a natural well-rounded
muscle,

00:37:47.232 --> 00:37:48.867 align:middle line:84%
it seems you have
to have the fat.

00:37:48.867 --> 00:37:51.203 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You do and
you would be surprised.

00:37:51.203 --> 00:37:52.704 align:middle line:90%
We have a world champion

00:37:52.704 --> 00:37:53.805 align:middle line:90%
swimmer from Australia.

00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:56.241 align:middle line:84%
Who's won
world championships

00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:59.144 align:middle line:84%
who uses Bulletproof coffee
and the Los Angeles Lakers,

00:37:59.144 --> 00:38:01.012 align:middle line:84%
there's an article
that came out this week

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:03.782 align:middle line:84%
that said they're all drinking
Bulletproof coffee before they

00:38:03.782 --> 00:38:05.317 align:middle line:90%
go out on the court.

00:38:05.317 --> 00:38:06.518 align:middle line:90%
Two nights ago...

00:38:06.518 --> 00:38:07.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: The Lakers?

00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:08.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.621 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh my
God, that's great!

00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:12.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And two nights ago, I
made Bulletproof coffee for all

00:38:12.657 --> 00:38:14.526 align:middle line:84%
of Third Eye Blind, the really
famous band who's sold...

00:38:14.526 --> 00:38:15.694 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, yes.

00:38:15.694 --> 00:38:16.995 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So they invited
me into the tour bus

00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:18.263 align:middle line:84%
and I made coffee
for all of them.

00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:20.832 align:middle line:84%
They drink Bulletproof coffee
before they go on stage.

00:38:20.832 --> 00:38:24.202 align:middle line:84%
So does another band, a
Billboard band called Chimaira.

00:38:24.202 --> 00:38:26.538 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it
because they want the focus

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:27.506 align:middle line:90%
and the energy and so do I.

00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:28.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, I can see it

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.975 align:middle line:84%
because I'm feeling this
moving around my brain.

00:38:29.975 --> 00:38:31.443 align:middle line:84%
I've studied a little
bit about the brain

00:38:31.443 --> 00:38:33.879 align:middle line:84%
and now I'm feeling
it, the activity

00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:35.347 align:middle line:90%
in the parietals as well.

00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:36.515 align:middle line:90%
This is really...

00:38:36.515 --> 00:38:37.682 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: The whole
brain wakes up.

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:39.017 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:38:39.017 --> 00:38:40.419 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Let's blend the
collagen in so you can try it.

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:40.986 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, okay so we have
a little noise in here, okay.

00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:41.653 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:43.655 align:middle line:90%
[ Blender Machine ]

00:38:43.655 --> 00:38:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So from a protein
perspective, collagen is one

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:48.360 align:middle line:84%
of the most important
missing proteins in our diet.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.461 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:38:49.461 --> 00:38:50.662 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And it's
also good for athletes.

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:52.464 align:middle line:84%
Other guys who are into
Bulletproof coffee,

00:38:52.464 --> 00:38:55.434 align:middle line:84%
a lot of them mixed martial arts
and crossfit athletes,

00:38:55.434 --> 00:38:56.568 align:middle line:84%
they're doing it
because they found

00:38:56.568 --> 00:38:58.737 align:middle line:84%
that the fat makes
them perform better.

00:38:58.737 --> 00:39:01.239 align:middle line:90%
Big wave surfers and some

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:04.476 align:middle line:84%
of the highest performance
people both artists

00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:08.313 align:middle line:84%
as well world champion
poker players.

00:39:08.313 --> 00:39:09.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That makes sense.

00:39:09.147 --> 00:39:10.615 align:middle line:90%
You need that sustained focus.

00:39:10.615 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: The final table

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.418 align:middle line:84%
at the last World
Poker Championships,

00:39:13.418 --> 00:39:15.854 align:middle line:84%
two of the four players
drank Bulletproof coffee

00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:17.022 align:middle line:90%
and one of them...

00:39:17.022 --> 00:39:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: [Laughter]
I didn't know all this.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.259 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: JC Tran wore the
Bulletproof emblem on his shirt

00:39:21.259 --> 00:39:22.394 align:middle line:90%
as a way of saying thank you.

00:39:22.394 --> 00:39:23.562 align:middle line:90%
We didn't sponsor him.

00:39:23.562 --> 00:39:27.265 align:middle line:84%
He was just, "This really
helped me," and wow,

00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:28.300 align:middle line:90%
like that's gratitude.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.301 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow!

00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:30.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: I'm so
thankful for that.

00:39:30.402 --> 00:39:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I'm just
so fun, I'm so happy.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.471 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You notice how we
got more foam from the collagen?

00:39:32.471 --> 00:39:33.872 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, we did.

00:39:33.872 --> 00:39:35.974 align:middle line:84%
So I'd be curious to
see how this tastes.

00:39:35.974 --> 00:39:37.409 align:middle line:84%
Now it's mixed in
with about a half.

00:39:37.409 --> 00:39:41.146 align:middle line:84%
I've only drank half of the
other and it's really delicious.

00:39:41.146 --> 00:39:44.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So this
replaces a normal smoothie.

00:39:44.916 --> 00:39:45.951 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:39:45.951 --> 00:39:46.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You've
got protein and fat.

00:39:46.518 --> 00:39:47.352 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:39:47.352 --> 00:39:48.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: No sugar required.

00:39:48.353 --> 00:39:49.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So now
what I'm tasting.

00:39:49.454 --> 00:39:51.423 align:middle line:84%
This is actually more
like a dairy latte.

00:39:51.423 --> 00:39:52.557 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You get that
kind of familiar taste

00:39:54.593 --> 00:39:56.128 align:middle line:90%
that you would have from milk

00:39:56.128 --> 00:39:58.263 align:middle line:84%
with that nice creaminess
from the fat.

00:39:58.263 --> 00:39:59.397 align:middle line:90%
It's really good!

00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:00.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: None of the
inflammation or mucus

00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:01.800 align:middle line:90%
that milk protein causes.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.337 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay, go
on for another moment

00:40:05.337 --> 00:40:08.840 align:middle line:84%
about this whole -- the
weight loss portion of this

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.676 align:middle line:84%
because again, you were telling
me off camera, if someone wants

00:40:11.676 --> 00:40:15.714 align:middle line:84%
to lose weight, one thing
you can do is do this

00:40:15.714 --> 00:40:16.915 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:40:16.915 --> 00:40:18.750 align:middle line:84%
You can do it without the
coffee and with the use

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.286 align:middle line:84%
of the vanilla powder that
you were talking about.

00:40:21.286 --> 00:40:23.755 align:middle line:84%
And the body doesn't
crave sweets.

00:40:23.755 --> 00:40:25.724 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't crave a
lot of food, period.

00:40:25.724 --> 00:40:27.659 align:middle line:84%
And so you do this
for a few days

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:30.595 align:middle line:84%
with mostly this during the day
and then a nice balanced meal

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:33.832 align:middle line:84%
with proteins, fats, vegetables
and so forth at night, right?

00:40:33.832 --> 00:40:34.633 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yes.

00:40:34.633 --> 00:40:35.667 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And what happens?

00:40:35.667 --> 00:40:36.768 align:middle line:84%
And why do you lose
weight so quickly

00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:37.969 align:middle line:84%
that way even though
you're ingesting a lot

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:39.804 align:middle line:90%
of calories in the fat?

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:42.007 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: To make sure people
understand the protocols,

00:40:42.007 --> 00:40:44.109 align:middle line:84%
there's a free thing that's
called the Bulletproof

00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:45.076 align:middle line:90%
Diet Infographic.

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:46.912 align:middle line:84%
If you go to
bulletproofdietbook.com,

00:40:46.912 --> 00:40:48.413 align:middle line:90%
you can download it for free.

00:40:48.413 --> 00:40:49.748 align:middle line:84%
I'm not trying to
sell you anything.

00:40:49.748 --> 00:40:51.182 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: No, and you have
the whole food chart there.

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:51.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:52.784 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's beautiful.

00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:54.186 align:middle line:90%
I have it on my refrigerator.

00:40:54.186 --> 00:40:56.454 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Cool, thank you and
this explains when to eat what.

00:40:56.454 --> 00:40:57.756 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:40:57.756 --> 00:40:59.024 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And it explains
which fats are inflammatory,

00:40:59.024 --> 00:41:01.326 align:middle line:84%
which proteins are inflammatory
and which ones aren't.

00:41:01.326 --> 00:41:04.329 align:middle line:84%
So the normal protocol for
losing weight at a healthy rate

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:05.931 align:middle line:84%
and when I say healthy
rate, this is going

00:41:05.931 --> 00:41:07.899 align:middle line:90%
to sound a little absurd.

00:41:07.899 --> 00:41:09.267 align:middle line:90%
I've had men particularly,

00:41:09.267 --> 00:41:11.870 align:middle line:84%
I've had very heavy men lose
a pound a day without needing

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.539 align:middle line:84%
to exercise, without
feeling hunger or cravings

00:41:14.539 --> 00:41:16.274 align:middle line:90%
or losing focus or being cold.

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:17.742 align:middle line:84%
Or any of the
things I used to experience

00:41:17.742 --> 00:41:19.711 align:middle line:84%
when I would lose 30
pounds and gain 35;

00:41:19.711 --> 00:41:21.346 align:middle line:90%
lose 30 pounds and gain 40.

00:41:21.346 --> 00:41:22.981 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: So you got up to 300.

00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:26.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yeah and so,
it's a natural process.

00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:29.254 align:middle line:84%
And what's going on here
is we're teaching the body

00:41:29.254 --> 00:41:31.656 align:middle line:84%
to burn fat as fuel and when
it does that, it's like, "Oh,

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:33.258 align:middle line:90%
I have fat here in my stomach.

00:41:33.258 --> 00:41:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Let me burn that
fat for fuel too."

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:38.029 align:middle line:90%
And that's going into ketosis.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:40.031 align:middle line:84%
The problem with things
like the Atkins diet

00:41:40.031 --> 00:41:41.700 align:middle line:84%
which is the most
famous ketosis diet --

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.168 align:middle line:90%
it's been around since 1970 --

00:41:43.168 --> 00:41:45.036 align:middle line:84%
is that there was so
much protein in it.

00:41:45.036 --> 00:41:47.238 align:middle line:84%
So it's a moderate
healthy protein diet,

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:50.408 align:middle line:84%
a high healthy fat diet
with tons of vegetables.

00:41:50.408 --> 00:41:52.811 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat that way,
you naturally lose weight.

00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:54.346 align:middle line:84%
But what you're talking
about, what we talked

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:57.015 align:middle line:84%
about beforehand is called
the rapid fat loss protocol.

00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:59.851 align:middle line:84%
That one is free on the website
but it's not on the infographic.

00:41:59.851 --> 00:42:02.387 align:middle line:84%
It's possible to lose weight
so quickly, it's dangerous,

00:42:02.387 --> 00:42:04.389 align:middle line:84%
because you store
mercury and other things

00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:06.758 align:middle line:84%
like pesticide toxins
in your fat

00:42:06.758 --> 00:42:08.193 align:middle line:84%
so with a rapid fat
loss protocol,

00:42:08.193 --> 00:42:11.329 align:middle line:84%
I made that for a couple of
clients who were unwilling

00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:13.798 align:middle line:84%
to wait to lose weight,
you know,

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:16.434 align:middle line:84%
half-a-pound a day is very
achievable for most people.

00:42:16.434 --> 00:42:17.736 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:42:17.736 --> 00:42:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And lots of very
heavy people can do more.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:42:19.638 --> 00:42:21.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: So that one
requires a little bit of hunger,

00:42:21.973 --> 00:42:25.644 align:middle line:84%
but not much and it relies
very much on Bulletproof coffee

00:42:25.644 --> 00:42:27.712 align:middle line:84%
and carefully timed when
you eat your protein

00:42:27.712 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and your other things.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.284 align:middle line:84%
When you do something like that,
you also need to bind the toxins

00:42:32.284 --> 00:42:34.886 align:middle line:84%
in your body because rapid
weight loss can mess you up.

00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:35.587 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What do
you bind them with?

00:42:35.587 --> 00:42:36.688 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:42:36.688 --> 00:42:37.822 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: There's a
couple of different ways

00:42:37.822 --> 00:42:39.424 align:middle line:84%
of approaching toxins
and these are all things

00:42:39.424 --> 00:42:41.026 align:middle line:84%
that are available
on the website.

00:42:41.026 --> 00:42:42.227 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:42:42.227 --> 00:42:44.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: One of them is
called coconut charcoal

00:42:44.029 --> 00:42:47.599 align:middle line:84%
and charcoal's been used in
Ayurveda and lots of societies

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:48.833 align:middle line:90%
for about 10,000 years.

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:51.636 align:middle line:84%
It's like the oldest
toxin binder known.

00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:54.005 align:middle line:84%
When you take a capsule of
it and you need a good amount

00:42:54.005 --> 00:42:56.541 align:middle line:84%
and it needs to be ultra,
ultra-fine and acid washed.

00:42:56.541 --> 00:42:58.777 align:middle line:84%
There's a bunch of little steps
to make it not have metals in it

00:42:58.777 --> 00:42:59.911 align:middle line:90%
and we go through all those

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:02.914 align:middle line:84%
on the upgraded coconut
charcoal that I make.

00:43:02.914 --> 00:43:05.550 align:middle line:84%
But you take the stuff and
it binds toxins in the gut.

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:06.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:43:06.818 --> 00:43:08.119 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Because there's
going to be a lot of those

00:43:08.119 --> 00:43:09.587 align:middle line:84%
and then you take something
called Glutathione Force.

00:43:09.587 --> 00:43:10.922 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.757 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Glutathione is
majorly important to meditation.

00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:16.861 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Alberto Villoldo
is a famous shaman

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:84%
and cultural anthropologist
and a friend.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.166 align:middle line:84%
I've done some training
with him.

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:25.503 align:middle line:84%
And Alberto takes
glutathione intravenously

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:27.906 align:middle line:84%
to improve his shamanic
meditation performance.

00:43:27.906 --> 00:43:28.973 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:30.108 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: The stuff that I use,

00:43:30.108 --> 00:43:33.111 align:middle line:84%
the Glutathione Force
is a special molecule

00:43:33.111 --> 00:43:35.213 align:middle line:84%
that encapsulates glutathione
to bring it through the lining

00:43:35.213 --> 00:43:37.515 align:middle line:84%
of the gut to raise
levels in the body more

00:43:37.515 --> 00:43:40.485 align:middle line:84%
than any other way you
can take glutathione.

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:42.387 align:middle line:84%
And we use actually a
pharmaceutical delivery

00:43:42.387 --> 00:43:44.289 align:middle line:84%
technique from Big
Pharma but instead

00:43:44.289 --> 00:43:46.157 align:middle line:84%
of putting some toxic
drug in there,

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:49.127 align:middle line:84%
we're putting a natural
substance that your liver uses,

00:43:49.127 --> 00:43:51.830 align:middle line:84%
your brain uses and it's
in every cell in your body.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:53.431 align:middle line:90%
So we crank those cells up.

00:43:53.431 --> 00:43:55.567 align:middle line:84%
Since that's your
main detoxing enzyme,

00:43:55.567 --> 00:43:58.903 align:middle line:84%
when you're losing weight super
rapidly, you get the ability

00:43:58.903 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:84%
to protect the liver and process
and oxidize these toxins better

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.775 align:middle line:84%
and you bind the toxins
so that it...

00:44:03.775 --> 00:44:05.176 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you pull
them out of the body.

00:44:05.176 --> 00:44:06.311 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:44:06.311 --> 00:44:09.347 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Okay so, if
we're an average person,

00:44:09.347 --> 00:44:11.683 align:middle line:84%
if you want to just boost your
brain power in the morning,

00:44:11.683 --> 00:44:13.051 align:middle line:84%
you can do what we're
talking about.

00:44:13.051 --> 00:44:16.421 align:middle line:84%
You use this methodology
and yeah.

00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:18.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: You do that and
don't eat fruit in the morning.

00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:19.858 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And don't
eat fruit, yes.

00:44:19.858 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:84%
Oh boy! I go right to sleep
if I eat fruit in the morning.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.028 align:middle line:84%
And don't eat fruit in the
morning and then you can go

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.764 align:middle line:84%
through your day
and the rest of --

00:44:25.764 --> 00:44:27.265 align:middle line:84%
we don't have time to
get into the rest of it.

00:44:27.265 --> 00:44:29.901 align:middle line:84%
I've been so intrigued with
just the brain part of it

00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:34.139 align:middle line:84%
but for just the Bulletproof
diet itself, you can go online.

00:44:34.139 --> 00:44:36.174 align:middle line:84%
It's a really beautiful
chart that's been done

00:44:36.174 --> 00:44:38.276 align:middle line:84%
and it shows you when
to eat, what to eat,

00:44:38.276 --> 00:44:40.912 align:middle line:84%
which things are more
toxic to the body,

00:44:40.912 --> 00:44:44.182 align:middle line:84%
which things are optimal
for the body and the brain.

00:44:44.182 --> 00:44:46.484 align:middle line:84%
And so, I highly
recommend everybody go there

00:44:46.484 --> 00:44:48.019 align:middle line:90%
for that portion of it.

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:52.056 align:middle line:84%
But for this alone, all of these
things we can find if we go

00:44:52.056 --> 00:44:53.258 align:middle line:90%
to your website, right?

00:44:53.258 --> 00:44:55.593 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: Yes, we go
to bulletproofexec.com.

00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:56.961 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:44:56.961 --> 00:44:57.862 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: The other thing that
I mentioned was the 40 Years

00:44:57.862 --> 00:44:58.963 align:middle line:90%
of Zen Brain Training.

00:44:58.963 --> 00:45:00.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yes, that
what I meant to get to.

00:45:00.398 --> 00:45:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And that's
40yearsofzen.com.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.536 align:middle line:84%
There's information
there about it

00:45:04.536 --> 00:45:06.404 align:middle line:84%
and what we're doing
there is simply saying,

00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:08.206 align:middle line:84%
"What does an advanced
Zen monk's brain look

00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:10.441 align:middle line:84%
like when you get the
electrical signals off of it?

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.143 align:middle line:90%
How do we teach your brain to do

00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:15.480 align:middle line:84%
that in seven really
intense days?"

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of seven days,
the side effects from this kind

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:22.620 align:middle line:84%
of training are 12 IQ points
that are stable a year later.

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You gain
20 IQ points yourself

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:28.126 align:middle line:84%
after you started figuring
this whole system out.

00:45:28.126 --> 00:45:29.494 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: I've used techniques.

00:45:29.494 --> 00:45:31.629 align:middle line:84%
There are lots of techniques
out there that do raise your IQ.

00:45:31.629 --> 00:45:32.697 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:33.865 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: And there's
a couple of them.

00:45:33.865 --> 00:45:36.401 align:middle line:84%
One of them is this,
this kind of training.

00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:38.203 align:middle line:84%
Another one that
raises most people's IQ

00:45:38.203 --> 00:45:39.804 align:middle line:90%
by at least 10 points is a kind

00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:41.539 align:middle line:84%
of computer-based
software training.

00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And I've got a bunch
of information

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.209 align:middle line:90%
on the website about that.

00:45:44.209 --> 00:45:46.311 align:middle line:84%
There's other things you
can do with electricity.

00:45:46.311 --> 00:45:47.679 align:middle line:84%
There's other things
that if you're over 30,

00:45:47.679 --> 00:45:48.780 align:middle line:90%
you can take creatine.

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.381 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole list
of IQ enhancing things.

00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:51.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And you
have that on your site?

00:45:51.449 --> 00:45:52.517 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: It's all
there and it's free.

00:45:52.517 --> 00:45:53.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And it's free!

00:45:53.685 --> 00:45:54.686 align:middle line:90%
Yippee!

00:45:54.686 --> 00:45:56.087 align:middle line:84%
>> Asprey: The reason
it's there...

00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:58.223 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Thank you so much for
that service, just that alone.

00:45:58.223 --> 00:45:59.357 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: You're welcome.

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:00.758 align:middle line:84%
If only someone had told
me this when I was 16,

00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.060 align:middle line:84%
my whole life would have
been so much easier.

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: [Laughter].

00:46:03.228 --> 00:46:05.230 align:middle line:84%
It took you 15 years
instead of a few months

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:06.831 align:middle line:90%
to get there but you now what?

00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:10.134 align:middle line:84%
Thanks, I appreciate what
you have done for the sake

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:12.503 align:middle line:84%
of the rest of us because we
can do it in a few months.

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:13.304 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: You're welcome.

00:46:13.304 --> 00:46:14.539 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And I love this.

00:46:14.539 --> 00:46:16.341 align:middle line:84%
This actually to me, I find
that totally satisfying

00:46:16.341 --> 00:46:17.408 align:middle line:90%
for my morning breakfast.

00:46:17.408 --> 00:46:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't want anything else.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.944 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Okay.

00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:21.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Thank
you so much, Dave.

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.947 align:middle line:84%
That should have been
good news for you

00:46:22.947 --> 00:46:24.582 align:middle line:90%
or someone you know and love.

00:46:24.582 --> 00:46:27.385 align:middle line:84%
You can go to Dave's
site, bulletproofexec.com

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:29.721 align:middle line:84%
to find the food chart we
were just talking about

00:46:29.721 --> 00:46:32.523 align:middle line:84%
and also directions on how
to make this wonderful coffee

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:35.860 align:middle line:84%
with grass-fed butter and
also with the brain octane.

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:37.362 align:middle line:84%
It actually tastes
really, really good.

00:46:37.362 --> 00:46:39.063 align:middle line:90%
I'm very happy with that.

00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:41.733 align:middle line:84%
Just a little tiny shift in
the palette but I have to say,

00:46:41.733 --> 00:46:46.004 align:middle line:84%
with the addition of the
powder, note no shift at all.

00:46:46.004 --> 00:46:47.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Asprey: Yeah.

00:46:47.105 --> 00:46:47.805 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's like
having a little latte.

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.007 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, until next time.

00:46:49.007 --> 00:46:51.543 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for joining
us here on  Gaiam TV .
