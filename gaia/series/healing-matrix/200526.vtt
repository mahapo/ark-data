>>SUE MORTER: We so
often lose our way

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:10%
in the chaos of
health trends, diets,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.920 align:middle line:10%
and emerging scientific
insights dictating what to do

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:10%
and what not to do.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.300 align:middle line:84%
David "Avocado" Wolfe
is with us to help

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:84%
navigate these tricky waters
to find deep wellness.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:84%
With over 12 million
followers on Facebook,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.520 align:middle line:84%
David Wolfe is proof
that the public

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
is awakening to self-empowerment
when it comes to health.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.640 align:middle line:84%
He's here to talk about
the importance of charcoal

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.400 align:middle line:84%
in daily detox and
exciting discoveries

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:90%
in the field of longevity.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, David, to
"Healing Matrix."

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID WOLFE:
Thank you, Dr. Sue.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.670 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.190 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful to have you.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So you grew up in a family
of doctors, as did I.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm very curious
to hear what that was like

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
for you to see health
care from the inside out,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.320 align:middle line:90%
as you must have.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:10%
>>WOLFE: A lot of ways it was
good because I had seen stuff

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.070 align:middle line:10%
like--

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:10%
1975, I was five years old.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:84%
There was a guy who had
crashed his motorcycle.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.320 align:middle line:84%
I think he was high on
cocaine and alcohol.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And my dad stitched him
up and saved his life

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
right there in front of
me, like 300 stitches.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:90%
It was intense.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So I learned things right there
because it was such a crisis

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.740 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
My dad couldn't get
me out of the room.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So I was in there
watching what was going on.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.530 align:middle line:10%
So I learned how to
stitch people up early

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.558 align:middle line:10%
and how to deal with broken
bones in the old way.

00:01:41.558 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:10%
Now they put all these
pins and plates in people.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.350 align:middle line:10%
And my dad did it the old way,
so I learned all that stuff.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.935 align:middle line:90%
And my mom, she ran the office.

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And she was an
anesthesiologist, so I learned

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.015 align:middle line:90%
about those kinds of things.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And I went to medical
trade shows with my dad

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.170 align:middle line:84%
as a real little kid,
four, five, six years old.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:84%
So I saw it from the
inside out all my life.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm into
alternative medicine today.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:10%
So what do you think you gleaned
from that whole background that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.750 align:middle line:10%
brought you to
where you are today?

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.150 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well,
the good, like how

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.360 align:middle line:84%
to put somebody back together,
the bad, and the ugly.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.505 align:middle line:84%
And there's some ugly
things going on, as we know,

00:02:15.505 --> 00:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
with what's going on
with drugs and the pill

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
for every ill theory,
which is really-- it's

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.360 align:middle line:90%
a very materialistic theory.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's the default theory
of our medical system.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And so therefore
it's quite dangerous

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
because we know that we're
actually a holistic being.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.390 align:middle line:84%
We're spiritual, emotional,
mental, and physical.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: And all of those
things need to be addressed.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And so our health care
needs to advance into that,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.520 align:middle line:90%
which at some level it's doing.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a little slow for my
taste, but we're getting there--

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [LAUGHS] I understand.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: --slowly but surely.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.887 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I grew up with the same,
so you're singing my song.

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:46.197 align:middle line:84%
I completely get
it that we are--

00:02:46.197 --> 00:02:48.280 align:middle line:84%
to approach all of this
from a holistic standpoint

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.465 align:middle line:84%
if we're ever really
going to get anywhere.

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:51.265 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:54.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you had a
transformative experience at 18

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:84%
regarding nutrition,
dietary needs.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.380 align:middle line:84%
So can you share a little bit
with our audience about that?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.700 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.575 align:middle line:90%
Well, I got started--

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
I think I started into
nutrition at some level

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
when I was 14 and
just being interested

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in supplements, and protein
powders, and stuff like that.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.980 align:middle line:84%
But when I was 18, 19,
somewhere around there,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.385 align:middle line:84%
I started realizing I'm
allergic to dairy products.

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:16.885 align:middle line:84%
And that was really,
as I found out,

00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
was cow's milk, commercially
available, homogenized,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:84%
non-organic cow's milk, which
we all grow up on in America.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized, oh, I'm
having a problem with this.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And so that began my
search into different types

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:90%
of diets and veganism.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.560 align:middle line:84%
So I started with
veganism when I was 19.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:90%
It's been like--

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
I've been a vegetarian
for over 30 years.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And it's just-- that's what
I like, and I enjoy it.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm happy about that because
I love animals, actually.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
vegetarianism or veganism

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.390 align:middle line:90%
is the best for everybody.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a great experiment,
and you'll learn a lot,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.473 align:middle line:84%
and you may find that it's
the right path for you,

00:03:51.473 --> 00:03:53.260 align:middle line:84%
as I found it was the
right path for me.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But I stay with it now
because I love animals,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.578 align:middle line:84%
and that's where I come from,
and I don't want to eat them.

00:04:00.578 --> 00:04:02.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Understood.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, when it comes to
essential nutrition,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
it might not come to mind for
everyone to immediately think

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.150 align:middle line:90%
about activated charcoal.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.193 align:middle line:84%
So can you speak
to us about that?

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: My whole
career has been about,

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
how do we take the most
important breakthroughs

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.902 align:middle line:84%
in health and longevity and
make it simple for everybody?

00:04:22.902 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And what are the
simplest ideas, and what

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.520 align:middle line:90%
are the simplest concepts?

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And that got me into raw foods
because raw foods is so simple.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:90%
Just eat the food as it is.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.850 align:middle line:90%
Eat the apple as it is.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.225 align:middle line:90%
Eat the bell pepper as it is.

00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:33.850 align:middle line:84%
Eat the lettuce as
it is because that's

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:90%
the way nature created it.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Leave it alone.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Leave it alone.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.240 align:middle line:90%
Don't do anything.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.130 align:middle line:84%
Looking at every way
to get people healthy,

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.963 align:middle line:84%
what's the simplest and
easiest thing to do?

00:04:40.963 --> 00:04:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I came across something
eventually about five years ago

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:90%
that really rocked me.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And it happened in
a roundabout way.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:90%
A friend of mine had called me.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
She's an Olympic
trainer from Calgary.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.280 align:middle line:84%
And she said, have you ever
heard of the C60 stuff?

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, no.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And so she's like,
here, here's a website.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:90%
Check it out.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, about two weeks
before, I've been thinking,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.020 align:middle line:84%
I've got to know off
the top of my head

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.795 align:middle line:84%
the top longevity
studies on animals ever.

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Sure enough, I hit that
website, and there it

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
is, the top
longevity study ever.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's a toxicology
study on carbon 60,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.280 align:middle line:84%
which is a carbon
compound that's

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:90%
found in activated charcoal.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's found where
lightning strikes a tree.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.012 align:middle line:84%
When you have a high electrical
arc striking wood or graphite,

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have the production

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.887 align:middle line:84%
of these types of
compounds, which

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:90%
are unique carbon compounds.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:84%
It's another
allotrope of carbon.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.100 align:middle line:90%
You have graphite.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.450 align:middle line:90%
You have diamonds.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.960 align:middle line:90%
They're both carbon.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.585 align:middle line:84%
Diamond is the
same as what you're

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
going to find in
charcoal, for example.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: But they're different.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.960 align:middle line:90%
And we call that an allotrope.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So this eventually led me
to Sir Harry Kroto's work

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.310 align:middle line:90%
and Rick Smalley's work.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
They won the Nobel
Prize for elucidating

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
the structure of the
carbon 60 molecule in 1996.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually after
about two months of really--

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:90%
I just went, I'm all in.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.285 align:middle line:84%
So I'm suddenly
doing five droppers

00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:57.745 align:middle line:84%
full of this stuff,
carbon 60 and olive oil,

00:05:57.745 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
because that's what the
research was done on,

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the toxicology research,
which, by the way,

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.120 align:middle line:84%
doubled the lifespan
of these animals.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.620 align:middle line:84%
That's why I was like, oh, I
better start taking this stuff.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.912 align:middle line:90%
So I started taking this stuff.

00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:08.522 align:middle line:90%
And it was too much, of course.

00:06:08.522 --> 00:06:10.480 align:middle line:84%
You're going to hit too
much of anything taking

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.797 align:middle line:90%
five, 10 droppers full a day.

00:06:11.797 --> 00:06:12.880 align:middle line:90%
You should start with one.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: [LAUGHS]

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: I trust my instincts.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Over the years, I've learned
to trust my instincts.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And I really recommend that
people trust their instincts.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.600 align:middle line:84%
And what ended up
happening is that I

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.850 align:middle line:84%
start having very strong
cravings for activated

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.412 align:middle line:90%
charcoal.

00:06:26.412 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
And so I started
going, let me just

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:84%
start taking some activated
charcoal with the C60.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:90%
And then a thought hit me.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, wait
a second, carbon 60

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:90%
is found in activated charcoal.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the number one longevity
substance ever found.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I better look at activated
charcoal and longevity.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:90%
And then I hit the jackpot.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Because this is something
that everybody has access to.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:90%
The concept is very simple.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:90%
We live in a toxic world.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Our food, air, and water
is loaded with toxins.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just driving down
the highway here to get here,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:90%
we've got all this exhaust.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.813 align:middle line:84%
We're breathing in
all this brake dust

00:07:02.813 --> 00:07:05.043 align:middle line:84%
and exhaust from
all these engines.

00:07:05.043 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Some of the worst
carcinogens are right there.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.700 align:middle line:90%
We're breathing it in.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
We're relying on our liver,
our kidneys, and our spleen,

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and other filtration organs
to filter that stuff off.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible that
we're overloaded?

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say the answer
is very likely yes.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So carbon is an
excellent detoxifier.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.083 align:middle line:90%
It's the best.

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:84%
It cleans your water--
charcoal filters.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:84%
It cleans your air--
charcoal filters.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:84%
It's what you use, for
example, in dialysis.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.330 align:middle line:84%
What do they use to
clean your blood?

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.470 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal filters.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:84%
What is the best filtration
mechanism there is?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.770 align:middle line:90%
It's charcoal.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's adsorptive,
interestingly, not absorbtive

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.570 align:middle line:90%
like a sponge--

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
adsorptive, like
electromagnetically

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.780 align:middle line:84%
attracts the wrong
charged materials.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Like heavy metals, for
example, or glyphosate

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:90%
is attracted to the charcoal.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.597 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a sponge.

00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:90%
People think, oh, it's a sponge.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:90%
It isn't.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's more
like electroplating.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.985 align:middle line:90%
It's like a refrigerator.

00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The charcoal comes in
like your refrigerator,

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.823 align:middle line:84%
and it attracts all
those magnets to it.

00:08:00.823 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
But eventually there's
too many magnets,

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.282 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't stick
to the fridge anymore.

00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
And then that
charcoal's been used up.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.567 align:middle line:84%
But that takes a
while to use it up.

00:08:07.567 --> 00:08:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Let's go back
for just a moment

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.930 align:middle line:84%
and just explain for our
viewers that most people think

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.168 align:middle line:84%
about activated charcoal
in a poison situation.

00:08:17.168 --> 00:08:18.210 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to absorb?

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.790 align:middle line:84%
or how they've referenced
it historically is,

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to take this
to help compensate

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.960 align:middle line:90%
for a poisoning that's happened.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.768 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: But to take it
on a regular daily basis

00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:90%
is a new thought process.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.105 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: That's right.

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So let's just--

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: You got it.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Let's just talk
about that for people

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
so that they can be assured
to be able to follow along

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:90%
with our conversation.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's
the transformation

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:84%
that I went through
five years ago

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:84%
is I started getting into
it every day, all the time,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.370 align:middle line:84%
instead of just when I
had an upset stomach.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.370 align:middle line:84%
It's very good if you get a
stomach bug, best thing ever.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.495 align:middle line:84%
If you're acutely poisoned or
if somebody is overdosing on

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:51.870 align:middle line:84%
sleeping pills or
something, they

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:54.660 align:middle line:84%
end up in the emergency
room, first line of defense

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the black
bottle, as Holt called it

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.950 align:middle line:84%
in his famous 1962
article, which

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
put activated charcoal
in every emergency room

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
almost in the entire
world, that one article,

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:90%
"The Black Bottle."

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.840 align:middle line:90%
So for that, we get that part.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
It's like the charcoal
adsorbs that toxic bacteria.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.930 align:middle line:84%
It adsorbs the toxic excretions
coming from the bacteria

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:90%
pretty much immediately.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden your
stomach poisoning, your flu

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:84%
poisoning, or your food
poisoning, it's like, whoa,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm better.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.080 align:middle line:84%
But the daily use of it
is a whole 'nother level.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And so people immediately
go, it's absorbing calcium.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:90%
It's absorbing magnesium.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.140 align:middle line:84%
I can't do it
because they're going

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:90%
to absorb my healthy nutrients.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And the answer to
that is there's never

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.170 align:middle line:84%
been a study in
70 years that has

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.780 align:middle line:84%
proven that activated
charcoal interferes

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.370 align:middle line:90%
with healthy nutrition.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It does not interfere
with protein metabolism,

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
with fat metabolism, with
carbohydrate metabolism,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.830 align:middle line:84%
with calcium, magnesium
absorption, with B vitamin use,

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:90%
with vitamin C use, any of it.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Now that's such a shocking
statement because in our minds

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
we think it's a
sponge, but it isn't.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not absorptive.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:84%
It's ad-, with a D, -sorptive,
which means it's more

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.103 align:middle line:84%
of an electromagnetic
phenomenon.

00:09:59.103 --> 00:10:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Now this brings up
something very interesting,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
which we should get into,
which is about the light bulb.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
When you see charcoal
on a fire, it glows.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.200 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a light.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:90%
Looks like a red light.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.767 align:middle line:84%
Well, the very first
light bulbs were not

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
invented by Thomas Edison.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.640 align:middle line:84%
He just bought the
patent and perfected it.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The original light bulb
filament was charcoal.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And I could go on like
this about all the history

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:90%
of charcoal.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Gunpowder-- you can't
manufacture gunpowder

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.240 align:middle line:90%
without charcoal.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Its history in chemistry,
its history in biology,

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
its history in farming
is absolutely one

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.150 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest stories of
the 20th and 21st century.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:90%
It's that big of a story.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I got into using it in
farming, and it completely

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
transformed our entire
farm in just one

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:84%
single year, using activated
charcoal and charcoal pellets

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:84%
to sprout food, and
grow our gardens,

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and to revive trees,
and make things fertile.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.580 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with this
very interesting energy

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
of black substances like
charcoal and black foods, which

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
have been known in
Daoism to extend life.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so can you just
share with our viewers

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:90%
how charcoal becomes activated?

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.895 align:middle line:90%
What is that process?

00:11:12.895 --> 00:11:13.695 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:11:13.695 --> 00:11:16.200 align:middle line:84%
So historically, we always
ate charcoal as human beings.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.600 align:middle line:84%
The coal biter, which
in Scandinavian legend,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.120 align:middle line:84%
is the story of the
runt of the family,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
the person in the family who was
not as hardy, as resilient, as

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.270 align:middle line:84%
capable to deal with the
elements, and the Arctic Ocean,

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.570 align:middle line:84%
They would sit home, and they
would tend the home fire.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And when they were
tending the home fire,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
they would eat bits of
charcoal around the edge.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And that was called-- they
were called the coal biter.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.860 align:middle line:84%
From age, say, seven
to 14, they would

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:84%
go through a startling
metamorphosis,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.760 align:middle line:84%
become the toughest, most
resilient, most capable,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.830 align:middle line:84%
smartest in the
family, the one who

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.270 align:middle line:84%
could stay out late and bring
the sheep in and the cows in.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And that became instilled
in the sagas of Iceland,

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.550 align:middle line:90%
as a person called a coal biter.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:84%
A person was transformed
from one person

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.050 align:middle line:84%
maybe not as weak, not as
strong as the rest of the family

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:84%
or as not as capable
as the rest of family

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and then transform that weakness
into strength, into abundance,

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:84%
into capabilities,
into responsibilities.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
And J.R.R. Tolkien was so
profoundly affected by that

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:middle line:84%
that he named his
organization in Oxford

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.220 align:middle line:84%
with C.S. Lewis The
Coal Biters to symbolize

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:90%
that transformation.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Now that's how we always
did it, historically.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But-- this is my
theory on this--

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.900 align:middle line:84%
there's always a solution
to every problem instantly

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.700 align:middle line:90%
created.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:84%
As we got into the
industrial age,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:90%
we needed stronger detoxifiers.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So right around 1900,
a Russian scientist

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
invented a concept called
activating charcoal, which

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.040 align:middle line:84%
is you blast superheated
steam through the charcoal

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:90%
at, say, 900 to 1,000 degrees.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And it pulls off
the remaining 10%

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
of the volatile
organic compounds,

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.900 align:middle line:84%
like the protein that
wasn't fully burned off,

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
or the sulfur that's
still present,

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:84%
or nitrogen compounds
that are still present.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.200 align:middle line:84%
To get those out of there,
it makes the substance

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.980 align:middle line:84%
more adsorptive so it's
more aggressive and more

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.707 align:middle line:84%
effective for a more
toxic situation.

00:13:05.707 --> 00:13:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
activated charcoal is.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Today, mostly made
out of coconut shell

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.230 align:middle line:84%
because that's where you can get
a very dense amount of carbon.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's an abundant resource.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Used up coconuts is an
abundant resource in the world.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's why today it's
mostly activated charcoal

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.930 align:middle line:90%
from coconut.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:21.930 align:middle line:90%
It could be made out of birch.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.160 align:middle line:90%
It could be made out of willow.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.450 align:middle line:84%
It could be made
out of kukui nut.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It could be made out
of walnut shells.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.988 align:middle line:84%
I could be made
out of many things.

00:13:26.988 --> 00:13:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It could be made even out of
medicinal mushrooms, which

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.880 align:middle line:84%
I do all of those things,
by the way, at home.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.760 align:middle line:84%
But coconut is the easiest
for the world population

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.080 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then what kind of
a dosage are you recommending?

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
What are you seeing results
with, how to take it,

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.550 align:middle line:90%
when to take it?

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And I also just want
to confirm again

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.540 align:middle line:84%
that it does not interfere
with nutritional absorption.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.570 align:middle line:90%
So I'm confirming that.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.150 align:middle line:84%
It does not interfere
with healthy nutrition.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
When you're dealing with
black and the substances that

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.240 align:middle line:90%
are black--

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:84%
Shilajit, fulvic acid,
charcoal, black foods

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.890 align:middle line:84%
like Chaga mushroom,
that's the reset.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
What you're doing there
is you're kind of like--

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.390 align:middle line:84%
when you've been dealing with
digestive distress or troubles

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years, you've
got to go back to the basics,

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.060 align:middle line:90%
like black and white foods.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.170 align:middle line:90%
And that's the reset.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So the carbon is actually
resetting your whole digestive

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.950 align:middle line:84%
It's an antiseptic substance
par excellence, par excellence.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the greatest
of all time in that regard.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is you
put that in your body

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.930 align:middle line:90%
at a small dosage at first--

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:38.730 align:middle line:84%
400 milligrams, 250
milligrams, 500 milligrams--

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.160 align:middle line:84%
in the morning with your
water before coffee,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.090 align:middle line:90%
before anything else.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.817 align:middle line:84%
My recommendation is wake
up with some purified water,

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
the best water you
can get a hold of--

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm a spring water guy.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And then you're going to
put a little bit of sea salt

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
in there for your electrolytes.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Shake that around.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.447 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
going to take that

00:14:52.447 --> 00:14:54.158 align:middle line:84%
with one capsule of
activated charcoal.

00:14:54.158 --> 00:14:55.200 align:middle line:90%
That's it, just to start.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:55.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Every day?

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Don't get too crazy.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.390 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And then you
consistently get that in.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:84%
Then over time you go,
yeah, maybe I'll do two.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:90%
Let's do two capsules.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And then at some point
you go, I'll do three.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, personally I do
five in the morning.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.770 align:middle line:84%
So this morning, I
got up and I did five.

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.615 align:middle line:90%
And I did five droppers of C60.

00:15:12.615 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:90%
But I've been at it hardcore.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.770 align:middle line:90%
And my body's used to it.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:90%
So you can do more as you go.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.482 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how does charcoal
work on a deeper cellular level?

00:15:21.482 --> 00:15:22.440 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.340 align:middle line:90%
What's the mechanism?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Great question.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:90%
This is so interesting.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.960 align:middle line:90%
And we don't really know.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So I've been through
all the journals, all

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.235 align:middle line:84%
the scientific journals, all
the medical journals, everything

00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:34.818 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure out, OK, what
is the scientific theory that's

00:15:34.818 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:90%
behind how charcoal works?

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle line:90%
How is it adsorptive?

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.130 align:middle line:84%
There's two competing
theories, and they're not

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:90%
mutually exclusive.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.450 align:middle line:90%
They can be put together.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.480 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
called pie stacking,

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and the other is called
Van der Waals forces.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Now those have to do with that
electroplating idea, which

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:84%
when that toxin gets close to
that surface of that charcoal,

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
it gets sucked onto it,
and it's glued onto it

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.010 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetically.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The problem with pie stacking
and Van der Waals forces

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
is it doesn't
explain how charcoal

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
acts at a distance, which it
definitely acts at a distance.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.463 align:middle line:84%
Which means that if I had an
open container of activated

00:16:07.463 --> 00:16:09.930 align:middle line:84%
charcoal right here, it's
going to attract toxins

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.150 align:middle line:84%
from the other side of
this room to itself.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.370 align:middle line:84%
It will purify the atmosphere
in this environment

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.590 align:middle line:84%
here, even if there's
no fans on or anything.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.512 align:middle line:90%
It pulls to itself.

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
happening in our body.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Most of the charcoal
that we ingest

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't actually get
into our bloodstream.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
It's in our intestines, and
it stays in our intestines.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And it purifies our
blood by a process

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:34.950 align:middle line:84%
called interstitial
dialysis, an amazing word.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can imagine by the
time somebody gets to me--

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
I worked in a Tijuana
clinic for 10 years.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I've been through it in terms
of alternative medicine.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.730 align:middle line:84%
But the general
population and what

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
it takes to change their
mind, and to break out

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.300 align:middle line:84%
of the pill for
every ill theory,

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.008 align:middle line:84%
the cut, burn, poison
theory, the doctors

00:16:54.008 --> 00:16:56.313 align:middle line:84%
are going to save us
theory, it's a lot.

00:16:56.313 --> 00:16:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So by the time they get to me,
they've been through a lot.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And so I would get cases, very
dangerous cases where somebody

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.170 align:middle line:90%
is headed for dialysis--

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:90%
kidney trouble, big time.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.675 align:middle line:84%
So I've been looking
for years, how

00:17:08.675 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:84%
do we deal with people who
are headed for dialysis?

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.898 align:middle line:84%
What can I get them
that's going to help them?

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Because medicine doesn't
have an answer for them.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
They're going to go on
dialysis, and then it's

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.908 align:middle line:84%
going to get worse,
and worse, and worse.

00:17:17.908 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to leave this Earth.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
And so eventually I came across
activated charcoal in a process

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:26.622 align:middle line:84%
called interstitial
dialysis, which as that bolus

00:17:26.622 --> 00:17:28.580 align:middle line:84%
of activated charcoal
moves through your body--

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:84%
let's say it's 400 milligrams
or 4,000 milligrams--

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
I take 4,000 milligrams,
but I'm a heavy user.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
What happens is
it pulls to itself

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
through the portal
vein, essentially,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:90%
the toxins in our bloodstream.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So it pulls it right across
and back into the intestines.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.390 align:middle line:90%
So it drains out.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.640 align:middle line:84%
It pulls through our
lymphatic system,

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.710 align:middle line:84%
and our large intestine
drains it and pulls it out,

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.290 align:middle line:90%
and then we excrete it.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Now about 1% or less of
the activated charcoal

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
consists of unique molecules
that do penetrate through

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
into our bloodstream, like
fullerenes, like the carbon 60

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:04.640 align:middle line:90%
molecule.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And those can penetrate into
all the tissues of our body.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
And so activated
charcoal is interesting.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, it activates
sequences of genes.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:84%
It's epigenetic in its effect,
that increase in improved

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.780 align:middle line:90%
detoxification mechanisms.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.242 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very interesting
discovery because you think,

00:18:23.242 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's just charcoal.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:90%
It's inert.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not inert.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:90%
Our body knows.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Our body has a sense of like,
oh, it's time to unload.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:90%
We've got carbon in the house.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's get rid of
these toxins now.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And then your body
will react in kind

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.093 align:middle line:84%
to the presence of the
carbon being there.

00:18:39.093 --> 00:18:40.760 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: What about
people who are wanting

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.180 align:middle line:10%
to detox from heavy metals or
molds, these types of things?

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it helpful?

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: First line of defense.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:90%
I love zeolites.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I love clay.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Nothing compares to
activated charcoal.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It's the bottom and
the basis of it all.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.580 align:middle line:90%
It's also a binder.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things about
taking too much activated

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.747 align:middle line:84%
charcoal, which, of
course, I did and probably

00:18:56.747 --> 00:18:58.340 align:middle line:84%
other people will
do, is you can get

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.770 align:middle line:84%
constipated because it's
too much of a binder.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:90%
You've got to go easy.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.460 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, do I take
charcoal with dinner?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.050 align:middle line:90%
You bet, all the time.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:06.932 align:middle line:90%
Not at the beginning.

00:19:06.932 --> 00:19:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Just start with
one in the morning.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.765 align:middle line:84%
But over the years,
I've learned,

00:19:09.765 --> 00:19:12.080 align:middle line:84%
like if I eat out somewhere,
I take activated charcoal

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.247 align:middle line:84%
with my meal, no question,
usually two, three, four,

00:19:14.247 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle line:90%
or five with the meal.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So I'll never get
a food poisoning,

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.460 align:middle line:84%
never get slowed
down, never pick up

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.643 align:middle line:84%
any bacteria in that food,
that kind of a thing.

00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What about the
opposite end of the spectrum--

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:28.790 align:middle line:84%
IBS, Crohn's disease,
inflammation in the bowel?

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.373 align:middle line:90%
What effect do you see there?

00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So what
my recommendation

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.780 align:middle line:84%
is there is back to what
we mentioned earlier,

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.405 align:middle line:84%
which is you're going
to have the water

00:19:35.405 --> 00:19:37.040 align:middle line:90%
with the electrolytes.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is one of those
things that as an investigator

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.668 align:middle line:84%
in research in medicine
all my life, essentially

00:19:42.668 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:84%
I discovered something
very powerful.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like anybody
to refute this.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Autoimmune conditions like
allergies, asthma, lupus, IBS,

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.208 align:middle line:84%
Crohn's, it's a
looping phenomenon.

00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I know that because
I have allergies,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.600 align:middle line:84%
and so I know when it loops
it's hard to shut it off,

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.250 align:middle line:90%
the autoimmune problem.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
The very first way,
and the ancient way,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
and the original way to
stop autoimmune looping

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.200 align:middle line:90%
is sea salt and water.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.030 align:middle line:90%
Drink salt water.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, for me-- I've shown
this many, many times

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.470 align:middle line:84%
on video, many, many
times in front of crowds

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.090 align:middle line:84%
that when I'm in an
allergy reaction,

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:17.687 align:middle line:84%
within 10 minutes of
drinking salt water it stops.

00:20:17.687 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:84%
This is also true with
asthma, and it's also

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:84%
true with lupus, and other
especially digestive-related

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.020 align:middle line:90%
autoimmune.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.870 align:middle line:10%
So this is Dr. Jensen's work,
and I originally found out

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.120 align:middle line:10%
about this through Dr. Jensen.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.270 align:middle line:84%
He said we have a major
epidemic in Western civilization

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:35.330 align:middle line:84%
of electrolyte deficiency,
especially salt deficiencies--

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
magnesium chlorides, potassium
chlorides, sodium chlorides--

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
the real stuff, not table
salt, not toxic salt,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.040 align:middle line:90%
real electrolytes.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And what that causes is
the body can't actually

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.300 align:middle line:90%
get on top of the irritation.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes an
autoimmune problem.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:54.950 align:middle line:84%
The salt hydrates the tissue
as the saltwater hydrates.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you take that and then
you put the charcoal in there,

00:20:58.130 --> 00:20:59.840 align:middle line:84%
like just a small
amount in the morning,

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:84%
you start to shut
down that autoimmune--

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Crohn's, IBS, lupus, asthma,
allergies-- first thing

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:07.795 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:21:07.795 --> 00:21:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And then if the stress hits
you and suddenly you're like,

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.192 align:middle line:90%
it hits me--

00:21:11.192 --> 00:21:13.650 align:middle line:84%
planes, trains, automobiles,
whatever-- and all of a sudden

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:15.590 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms come back, I start
getting the itchy eyes and all

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:84%
that other stuff, I just drink
the saltwater again, take

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.493 align:middle line:84%
a little activated charcoal,
and boom, within 10 minutes.

00:21:21.493 --> 00:21:22.910 align:middle line:84%
And all people
have to do to prove

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:90%
that wrong or right is try it.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What I want to make sure
that the viewers understand

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.140 align:middle line:84%
is that that may or may not be
something to do preventatively

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:90%
every day, all the time.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.557 align:middle line:84%
What are your
feelings about that?

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you think people should do
it everyday preventatively?

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, it's
dosage then, right?

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.732 align:middle line:84%
So like for example
I've got people--

00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I've been through this.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:41.190 align:middle line:84%
You probably been
through this, too.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Where we drink the eight
glasses of water a day,

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:90%
eight 8 ounce glasses of water.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And what happened?

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.350 align:middle line:90%
We got dehydrated.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know it
was like, I got to go pee.

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like 20 minutes, I got to
then go back to the bathroom

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.110 align:middle line:84%
again, because we don't have
the electrolytes to hold

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:90%
the water in.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.113 align:middle line:84%
So then I got into
this whole thing--

00:21:57.113 --> 00:21:59.030 align:middle line:84%
it was an instinct,
really, that led me to it.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And also a Russian researcher
that had showed me this,

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.310 align:middle line:84%
basically gave me
the tip on this one.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And eventually
what I realized is

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.540 align:middle line:84%
that you have to have
the right amount of water

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and the right amount of
electrolytes for you,

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
which is unique to you.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's different for me.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm Mediterranean
genetically, so I

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.503 align:middle line:84%
can handle a lot of salt.
Way more than I thought.

00:22:22.503 --> 00:22:24.420 align:middle line:84%
For example, when people
say like, what do you

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.337 align:middle line:90%
mean drink salt water?

00:22:25.337 --> 00:22:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about a
tablespoon per liter.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:90%
Now people go no, no, no.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.950 align:middle line:90%
That's got to be bad.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:29.770 align:middle line:90%
It can't be bad.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.597 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the person.

00:22:31.597 --> 00:22:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And how are
they going to know?

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.960 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: They have to try.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
It's called the trial
and success method.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So let's go back
to activated charcoal,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.020 align:middle line:90%
its relationship to longevity.

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Specifically lay that
out for our viewers.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.090 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So I eventually found-- so I
had a thing that happened where

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.620 align:middle line:90%
I suddenly went, wait a second.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
I better look into activated
charcoal longevity.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It just hit me one day, and
I was like I never looked.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.750 align:middle line:84%
So I got all the books out
there on activated charcoal

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.550 align:middle line:84%
that were ever
written, and charcoal.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.883 align:middle line:90%
I went through all the research.

00:22:57.883 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
I eventually came across
the Russian gerontologist

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.070 align:middle line:90%
Frolkis' work--

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:06.270 align:middle line:84%
F-R-O-L-K-I-S. And
this is a shocker--

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.890 align:middle line:90%
it really is a shocker.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:84%
He had succeeded in extending
the lifespan of animals

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.510 align:middle line:90%
by over 40%.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.167 align:middle line:84%
Even animals-- this
is interesting,

00:23:14.167 --> 00:23:15.750 align:middle line:84%
because people came
to him like, well,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.400 align:middle line:84%
does the animals have to
be on activated charcoal

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:90%
its whole life?

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And he found out and
validated a theory

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.060 align:middle line:84%
that we have that really one
of the main problems that

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.390 align:middle line:84%
causes aging is that we
have metabolic problems

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
with detoxification that
accumulate and reach

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.210 align:middle line:84%
a crisis at a certain
point in our life.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.918 align:middle line:84%
And it's usually
runs 60 years of age.

00:23:34.918 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
We're all of a sudden at
a metabolic crisis where

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the body goes, well, we
can't detoxify that toxin,

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.900 align:middle line:90%
we just leave that one.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.970 align:middle line:84%
We can't deal with this,
we'll just leave that.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:43.590 align:middle line:90%
We can't do this one either.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.970 align:middle line:84%
We better deal with this
right here, right now,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.740 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
crisis of the moment.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's that gets us.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
So Frolkis did that research
with activated charcoal

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and he found out even if you
start the animals late in life

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:59.560 align:middle line:84%
you could extend their lifespan
dramatically by over 40%.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Now what does that mean?

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Because people say, 40%,
what does that mean?

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.720 align:middle line:84%
We're human beings, we're
supposed to get 100 years.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.220 align:middle line:84%
If we're really honest and there
was no industry, no toxins,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.240 align:middle line:84%
no pollutants, no stress,
we'd get 100 years.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that means
if we get 40% more

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.480 align:middle line:90%
life, that's 140 years of age.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:18.090 align:middle line:84%
That's what we're supposed to
get if we do everything right.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And we see that
coming into view now.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.380 align:middle line:84%
That sounded like a
fantasy 10 years ago.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But with the stem cell
research, the cell biology

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
stuff where you can for example
take natural killer cells out

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
of your body, multiply them,
put them back in your body.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Those kinds of therapies
with the charcoal,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.622 align:middle line:84%
with the carbon 60, with the
yoga, with the spiritual work--

00:24:38.622 --> 00:24:40.080 align:middle line:84%
all of a sudden
the picture becomes

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.330 align:middle line:90%
possible of how the yogis--

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, my favorite yoga
is the Shivapuri Baba.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.230 align:middle line:90%
How did he live to be 137?

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.370 align:middle line:90%
Well now I see it.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.155 align:middle line:90%
Now I can see how he did it.

00:24:49.155 --> 00:24:50.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Different lifestyle.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Different focal point.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yeah.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And just it's
becoming easier, too.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.233 align:middle line:84%
If you just want that,
if you focus on that.

00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:57.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So can you
speak to the mechanism

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:03.270 align:middle line:84%
about how in these experiments
with the animals, how

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:84%
their lifespan was increased
with the metabolic system

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.070 align:middle line:90%
and toxicity.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.070 align:middle line:84%
What was the mechanism
there that was happening?

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: So there's
really three types

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:90%
of toxins we're dealing with.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
metabolic toxins,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.340 align:middle line:84%
which are just natural byproduct
toxins of life and living

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.110 align:middle line:90%
and stress and normal stuff.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.840 align:middle line:84%
There's another type of
toxin, which is food toxins.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.010 align:middle line:90%
Food has toxins in it.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:90%
There's no way around that.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's just one of
the things that we

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.590 align:middle line:84%
know that the less you
eat the longer you live,

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.515 align:middle line:90%
so the more you get to eat.

00:25:33.515 --> 00:25:34.890 align:middle line:84%
When I say food
has toxins, and I

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.327 align:middle line:84%
mean there's actually
like toxic compounds that

00:25:37.327 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
are in there that are good
in certain dosages, for sure.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.035 align:middle line:84%
Like celery-- celery has
toxic compounds in it

00:25:42.035 --> 00:25:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that are good in
certain dosages.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Too much is too much, and
you'll have a toxic reaction.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Your body has to detoxify that.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Carbon works on all three of
those, and very aggressively.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Better than clay, better than
zeolites, better than fiber.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.610 align:middle line:90%
Better than anything.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm not saying those
things aren't important.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.520 align:middle line:84%
All of those things
are important.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.300 align:middle line:90%
I like clay.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.100 align:middle line:90%
I like zeolites.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I like taking in a lot
of fiber and vegetables.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But charcoal is the
king of that pile.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.992 align:middle line:84%
And so it works on absorbing
them and then excreting them.

00:26:09.992 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to say something
that is very important here,

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:84%
because when you ingest
activated charcoal,

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.640 align:middle line:84%
or when an animal
does, it's excreted out

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.260 align:middle line:90%
of them in their feces.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And it goes into
the septic system

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.507 align:middle line:84%
and continues to work in the
septic system, purifying it.

00:26:23.507 --> 00:26:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Because not all the activated
charcoal or charcoal

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.410 align:middle line:84%
compounds or carbon 60
compounds are actually

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.280 align:middle line:90%
used up in the body.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And so it will continue
to purify the environment.

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if you
have an old toilet,

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:84%
like my house is 1960 and
the septic systems old.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:43.020 align:middle line:84%
Oh, as soon as we dump the
charcoal down the toilet,

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.270 align:middle line:84%
little tiny-- you want the
smallest stuff, because you

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:46.260 align:middle line:84%
don't want to clog--
you don't want

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.720 align:middle line:84%
to dump grains in there because
that can clog your system up.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.637 align:middle line:90%
The smallest material.

00:26:49.637 --> 00:26:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Like you take, you
know, powder and so you

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.042 align:middle line:84%
dump that in your toilets
over and over and over again,

00:26:54.042 --> 00:26:56.370 align:middle line:84%
that smell that comes up
through the toilet disappears.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Because carbon and
activated charcoal

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is not only effective at
adsorping physical material

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:08.040 align:middle line:84%
solids, it's also very
capable of absorbing gases.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
thing that I think

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:12.360 align:middle line:84%
is actually the most
important thing for longevity.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.960 align:middle line:84%
When you have backed up
toxic gases in your body,

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that is the worst thing for your
health of all, in my opinion.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And is this the
mechanism of premature aging

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:90%
that you're referencing?

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.933 align:middle line:90%
Because the toxic buildup shows.

00:27:25.933 --> 00:27:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And eventually your body goes,
we've got a toxic load here

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.725 align:middle line:84%
and we've got a
toxic load there,

00:27:29.725 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
and eventually your body
starts to pile it up.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is what
Frolkis has shown.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.720 align:middle line:84%
He's shown that this concept or
this theory of aging, that it's

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.350 align:middle line:84%
a metabolic buildup of
toxins that gets us,

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.540 align:middle line:84%
is the reason why
charcoal is important.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it brings
those metabolic

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.270 align:middle line:84%
toxins down and takes that
burden off your system.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Which to an everyday
person means more energy.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.280 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.255 align:middle line:84%
It means that you can
do more with less sleep.

00:27:56.255 --> 00:27:58.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into that,
because that's something--

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.330 align:middle line:84%
I've proven that
conclusively to myself.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.830 align:middle line:84%
That the reason why
we need to sleep

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.122 align:middle line:84%
is because we're detoxifying
and our body is filtering.

00:28:04.122 --> 00:28:07.770 align:middle line:84%
It's got to filter stresses
and metabolic toxins

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.020 align:middle line:84%
and toxins we breathe in
from exhaust fumes and all

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:90%
this other stuff.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.998 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we've
gotta get horizontal

00:28:12.998 --> 00:28:16.255 align:middle line:84%
and we've got to
revive, we rejuvenate.

00:28:16.255 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, when we have
activated charcoal

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
what ends up happening
is we suck up

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.897 align:middle line:84%
all those metabolic
toxins quickly because it

00:28:21.897 --> 00:28:24.480 align:middle line:84%
takes the burden off our liver
and our kidneys and our spleen.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.438 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to deal
with all this filtration.

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
it also sucks up

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.450 align:middle line:90%
the used up neurotransmitters.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.825 align:middle line:84%
Now we've all
heard of serotonin.

00:28:32.825 --> 00:28:34.742 align:middle line:84%
We're like, oh, serotonin
makes us feel happy,

00:28:34.742 --> 00:28:35.580 align:middle line:90%
happy like the sun.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:90%
There's two sides to serotonin.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.290 align:middle line:84%
There's also a sedative
and a lethargic side.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
like bee venom,

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.430 align:middle line:84%
you look at stinging nettle,
you look at a wasp sting.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And you look at what's
in those venoms,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.000 align:middle line:84%
the main ingredient
is serotonin.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.968 align:middle line:90%
It causes lethargy.

00:28:49.968 --> 00:28:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is why in
the morning you've

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.640 align:middle line:90%
got to get up and drink water.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you urinate
out that used up serotonin,

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.888 align:middle line:90%
you wake up.

00:28:56.888 --> 00:28:58.680 align:middle line:84%
If you start hitting
the activated charcoal

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:90%
in big dosages--

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.147 align:middle line:90%
now you work up to this.

00:29:01.147 --> 00:29:02.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend
this for new people.

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:04.230 align:middle line:84%
This is something
you build into.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
But for example, I was running
a longevity conference.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.760 align:middle line:84%
I was up for almost
four straight days,

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.350 align:middle line:84%
like two hours of
sleep every night.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And then the fourth night I had
to get up and rally volunteers

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.710 align:middle line:90%
from 7 till 8 AM.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I went to bed at 6:00.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:19.990 align:middle line:90%
So I had an hour.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I got up.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.580 align:middle line:84%
I had a liter of water,
my favorite spring water.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.290 align:middle line:84%
And I took 12,500 milligrams
of activated charcoal.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.250 align:middle line:84%
In a half hour I was completely
alert, totally awake,

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and perfectly fine
the rest of the day

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.250 align:middle line:84%
like I'd gotten eight
hours a night of sleep.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
So my recommendation
for those who are

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.750 align:middle line:84%
adventurous and
want to investigate

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.410 align:middle line:84%
this, as your body
gets used to it

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
and as you get deep into the
activated charcoal and the C60

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:middle line:84%
and those type of things,
and the fullerenes.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.820 align:middle line:90%
Then you can up the dosage.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can start to
see like, oh, there

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:55.945 align:middle line:84%
is a connection between energy
availability and toxic load.

00:29:55.945 --> 00:29:58.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So do you need more to
get the same effect as time

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:90%
goes on?

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: No.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.830 align:middle line:90%
I'd probably say less.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:90%
I mean, for me.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't take
12,500 milligrams now.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.630 align:middle line:84%
I can get away with like
5,000 milligrams or less,

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.790 align:middle line:84%
because I can get
that same effect.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't have to go overboard.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's not-- I guess
it's not an agonist.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal is not an agonist.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't linger
in your system.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.300 align:middle line:84%
We say like opiates
are agonists.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Once they hit that
receptor site,

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.330 align:middle line:84%
you need more and
more and more of it

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:90%
to activate that receptor site.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal is not like that.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Has to be activated?

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.300 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Doesn't have to
be activated, actually.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a great question.

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.208 align:middle line:84%
People who have very
sensitive digestion,

00:30:37.208 --> 00:30:39.720 align:middle line:84%
I recommend going to willow
charcoal or birch charcoal just

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.682 align:middle line:90%
by itself.

00:30:40.682 --> 00:30:42.390 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do
activated charcoal,

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:90%
just do a small amount.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Because activated charcoal
is very aggressive.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And some people,
especially who have

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.595 align:middle line:84%
had a history of
digestive disturbance,

00:30:49.595 --> 00:30:51.262 align:middle line:84%
you want to just go
to regular charcoal.

00:30:51.262 --> 00:30:52.410 align:middle line:90%
It's not as aggressive.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:90%
It's calmer on your system.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.158 align:middle line:84%
I have very hardy
digestion, so I

00:30:56.158 --> 00:30:57.450 align:middle line:90%
want the more aggressive stuff.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So I've done both
for a long time,

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't even
feel regular charcoal.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not strong enough for me.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.117 align:middle line:84%
I need activated charcoal,
and like five capsules.

00:31:07.117 --> 00:31:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Did you ever?

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.997 align:middle line:90%
Or just now don't?

00:31:09.997 --> 00:31:11.580 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, it's
just I just know--

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you notice
over the years.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.800 align:middle line:84%
Like the non-activated
charcoal is just not strong

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.180 align:middle line:90%
enough for me.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Are there
super charcoals?

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.527 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Yes, there
are super charcoals.

00:31:21.527 --> 00:31:22.605 align:middle line:90%
That's what C60 is.

00:31:22.605 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:84%
C60 is first of the
super charcoals,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:29.010 align:middle line:84%
or fullerenes, named after
Buckminster Fuller, who really

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.370 align:middle line:84%
innovated the
geodesic dome, which

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.830 align:middle line:84%
mimics very strongly
the structure

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.050 align:middle line:84%
of these fullerene
carbon compounds.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:39.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's why this group of
compounds, which was really

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.060 align:middle line:84%
elucidated and discovered
by Kroto and Smalley

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:46.230 align:middle line:84%
and others in their 1996
Nobel Prize victory.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.590 align:middle line:84%
That really began to bring
people to the realization

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.510 align:middle line:84%
that when you look at charcoal
and you see it's in layers,

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:90%
you can-- remember?

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, you look at
charcoal and you're like,

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:90%
oh, it's got layers.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Not all of it is in layers.

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Some of it is actually
spherical or oblique and ovoid.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.490 align:middle line:84%
And it has the structures
of the Buckminster Fuller

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.700 align:middle line:84%
geodesic domes, and that's
why that name stuck.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.980 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly the
most stable of them

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:16.380 align:middle line:84%
is the C60, which is the exact
same structure as a soccer

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.090 align:middle line:90%
ball or a football.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.000 align:middle line:84%
It's 20 hexagons
and 12 pentagons.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.842 align:middle line:84%
That's why a football,
or soccer ball,

00:32:22.842 --> 00:32:25.050 align:middle line:84%
is that shape, because if
you kick it it won't break.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the C60 is
so enduring and so strong.

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:84%
The C70, which is the second
most dominant fullerene you're

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.130 align:middle line:90%
going to find in a sample--

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.733 align:middle line:84%
let's say a tree
gets hit by lightning

00:32:34.733 --> 00:32:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at
the fullerenes in there,

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:41.175 align:middle line:84%
60% of those fullerenes will
be C60, 30% will be C70.

00:32:41.175 --> 00:32:44.490 align:middle line:84%
C70 is a rugby
ball, and that's why

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:90%
a rugby ball is a rugby ball.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.550 align:middle line:90%
It's tough, it won't break.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why C70 is the
second strongest of them.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.958 align:middle line:84%
And it's sometimes
called a rugby ballene.

00:32:52.958 --> 00:32:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
derivative fullerenes,

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.130 align:middle line:84%
which are also found with
every production of fullerenes.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, so high
electrical arc will form

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.620 align:middle line:90%
this against wood or graphite.

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And me personally, where
I'm at, because I've

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.962 align:middle line:90%
been doing C60 for five years.

00:33:05.962 --> 00:33:07.920 align:middle line:84%
I've been making it, I
know everything about it

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.020 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.500 align:middle line:84%
Where I'm at personally is I
make my own C60, C70, and then

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.320 align:middle line:84%
related fullerene
products for my own use.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the more
natural ratio of those things.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:23.370 align:middle line:84%
The market isn't
ready for that yet.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:84%
The market is barely even
ready for C60, right?

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.825 align:middle line:90%
So you go to C60 first.

00:33:27.825 --> 00:33:28.950 align:middle line:90%
That's got to be developed.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:29.930 align:middle line:84%
We got to develop
our knowledge there,

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:31.680 align:middle line:90%
and then people get into it.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll be ready
for what will come next.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: How are you making it?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.650 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I make it--
well, first of all,

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I make it with
the best olive oil

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.645 align:middle line:84%
in the world,
which is my friends

00:33:40.645 --> 00:33:41.910 align:middle line:90%
from the north of Crete.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have a olive
tree on their farm

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.380 align:middle line:90%
that's 4,000 years old.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I love them and
I love their product.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And they supply it-- a lot
of times I'll show up there

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in Toronto, and
they'll just be like,

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.500 align:middle line:84%
we're just giving this to
you, because we love you.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And because I love
olive oil, and they know

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.360 align:middle line:90%
that we have this wonderful--

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm a promoter
of olive oil, really

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:01.620 align:middle line:90%
good olive oil.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:04.470 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to
get the right C60, C70

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.480 align:middle line:90%
and related fullerenes.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.219 align:middle line:84%
And it has to come from
a really quality lab.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And I've searched out
labs all over the world

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.540 align:middle line:84%
and gotten samples from
labs all over the world.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:14.909 align:middle line:90%
And we've developed our own lab.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.492 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Can you tell
us about the study

00:34:16.492 --> 00:34:20.280 align:middle line:10%
that first gave you interest
in C60 and the olive oil?

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That was Fathi
Moussa's study out of Paris.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.590 align:middle line:84%
He's a Parisian toxicologist
who first got the tip on C60

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.760 align:middle line:84%
from Kroto and Smalley and
the Nobel Prize victory.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.550 align:middle line:84%
And he was doing a
toxicology study on rats.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.929 align:middle line:84%
So he was just
figuring out like,

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:35.887 align:middle line:84%
hey, let's just kill
these rats with this stuff

00:34:35.887 --> 00:34:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and see how much of this
stuff these rats can

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.690 align:middle line:90%
take before they die.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.280 align:middle line:90%
And he did controls.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.780 align:middle line:84%
He did controls
with just olive oil.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.570 align:middle line:84%
He did controls with olive
oil and certain ratios

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.449 align:middle line:90%
of fullerenes in it.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:49.179 align:middle line:84%
You know, this
much C60, more C60.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:52.199 align:middle line:84%
And what happened was is
actually after five years--

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.447 align:middle line:84%
now a rats life spans is
about 2 and 1/2 years--

00:34:54.447 --> 00:34:56.489 align:middle line:84%
one of the rats was still
alive, and most of them

00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:01.110 align:middle line:84%
had lived 90% longer than
their normal lifespan.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:06.487 align:middle line:84%
And the prolongation of lifespan
of rodents by carbon 60--

00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that's roughly the
name of the study--

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Fathi Moussa-- M-O-U-S-S-A,
his first name F-A-T-H-I.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.233 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Where do people find C60?

00:35:15.233 --> 00:35:17.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: You can-- I mean,
you have to search around

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.867 align:middle line:84%
on the internet and you have
to find a brand that you trust.

00:35:20.867 --> 00:35:22.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: How are they going
to know how to trust it?

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.930 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: You've got to
trust the person, right,

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:25.840 align:middle line:90%
and who makes it.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I've been in the
beginning the longest,

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.477 align:middle line:84%
so at this point I think
I know what I'm doing.

00:35:30.477 --> 00:35:32.310 align:middle line:10%
I've worked with the
best labs in the world,

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.810 align:middle line:10%
in and outside of
the United States,

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:35.550 align:middle line:10%
in and outside of North America.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.090 align:middle line:10%
And all over the world.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.960 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm pretty sure
I've found the best

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.703 align:middle line:10%
labs in the world,
which I will not reveal,

00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:44.620 align:middle line:10%
because that has been
blood, sweat, and tears.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:46.410 align:middle line:84%
That's been a very
difficult research

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.087 align:middle line:84%
project over many
years and many travels.

00:35:50.087 --> 00:35:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Why did scientists
think it was potentially

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:53.930 align:middle line:90%
toxic before the study?

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:54.930 align:middle line:90%
What were they thinking?

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:56.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Well, all
carbon contains

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.880 align:middle line:84%
the basis of organic chemistry,
which is the benzene molecule.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.710 align:middle line:84%
That's the basis of
organic chemistry.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And so you're always
curious of like,

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, with carbon
compounds is there

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:11.190 align:middle line:84%
going to be any aberrant
benzene molecules present?

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.760 align:middle line:90%
Could there be solvents present?

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
use solvents like

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.527 align:middle line:84%
hexane to extract
fullerenes, and you

00:36:20.527 --> 00:36:22.110 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure
that there's nothing

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:23.610 align:middle line:90%
left in your final product.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you always
want to be cautious.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's also why you
want the best carbon

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.350 align:middle line:84%
materials and best C60 and
related products out there.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't want
any solvents sneaking in.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting, the research
on C60, because it has very,

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.660 align:middle line:84%
very strong research
when consumed in oil--

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's oil soluble,
not water soluble--

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.970 align:middle line:84%
but when you try to force
it into water solubility

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.810 align:middle line:90%
it's hydrophobic.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It jumps away from water.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore when you
try to inject it as a powder

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:02.370 align:middle line:84%
into a life form, it can
have a toxic reaction

00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.220 align:middle line:84%
because it's not
solubilized in oil.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And olive oil versus
other vegetable oils?

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Flashpoint?

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.055 align:middle line:90%
Why olive oil?

00:37:10.055 --> 00:37:12.680 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: Olive oil has the most
research behind it, that's why.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's probably the best
material to solubilize in.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.520 align:middle line:90%
I've used avocado oil.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.190 align:middle line:90%
I've used hemp seed oil.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.430 align:middle line:90%
I've used coconut oil.

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:90%
All of the above.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I personally prefer
olive oil, and that's

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:29.300 align:middle line:84%
what the research
has landed on also.

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we're
going with it.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we have to be sure
we know how much is too much.

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.840 align:middle line:84%
How do we approach this
in a safe manner, where

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.147 align:middle line:84%
somebody is not going to create
symptoms for themselves or--

00:37:41.147 --> 00:37:43.105 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: You don't want
to detoxify too rapidly

00:37:43.105 --> 00:37:45.265 align:middle line:90%
is what you're getting at.

00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:47.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So if they're
detoxifying too rapidly,

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:50.030 align:middle line:84%
let's list symptoms that they're
going to feel immediately

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.965 align:middle line:84%
that they need to back off or
slow or shift their approach.

00:37:52.965 --> 00:37:54.340 align:middle line:84%
What might they
first experience?

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:55.140 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So initially you might have
foggy thinking or very radical

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:90%
changes in your energy.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.807 align:middle line:84%
You're suddenly up,
then you're suddenly

00:38:01.807 --> 00:38:03.070 align:middle line:90%
like I've got to lay down.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.142 align:middle line:84%
Or you might feel
like something's

00:38:05.142 --> 00:38:07.600 align:middle line:84%
coming out-- the next thing
you know you have turbid urine.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, what
just came out of me?

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.653 align:middle line:90%
And those kinds of things.

00:38:10.653 --> 00:38:12.070 align:middle line:84%
Those are
detoxification symptoms.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.340 align:middle line:84%
You might have stuff
come out of your skin.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.520 align:middle line:84%
But with carbon compounds
you don't really

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.900 align:middle line:90%
get that kind of symptom.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.790 align:middle line:84%
You get more of an
internal symptom,

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.280 align:middle line:84%
because the carbon can
lock it up pretty well.

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a matter of excreting it.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.615 align:middle line:84%
So with fullerenes
and carbon 60,

00:38:25.615 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:84%
if we're really looking
at the science of it,

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:32.170 align:middle line:84%
are fractionated parts of an
overall activated charcoal.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:35.332 align:middle line:84%
My recommendation is you
always take them together.

00:38:35.332 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the research shows.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.850 align:middle line:84%
It's actually better that
they're taken together than one

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.100 align:middle line:90%
separate from the other.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: C60 plus the activator?

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Yes.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.790 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, both together.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.248 align:middle line:84%
My instinct led me
there years ago.

00:38:47.248 --> 00:38:48.582 align:middle line:90%
And so when I got into writing--

00:38:48.582 --> 00:38:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm writing a book
on this right now--

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.885 align:middle line:84%
I did find out, I
was like, oh, there's

00:38:51.885 --> 00:38:53.800 align:middle line:84%
some research on taking
them both together.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And they work better
together, which was--

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.790 align:middle line:90%
that's what I'd felt, for sure.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.165 align:middle line:90%
Because the carbon is a binder.

00:38:59.165 --> 00:39:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Your activated charcoal
is your binder.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you're stirring
up the muck--

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.310 align:middle line:84%
let's say in an organ,
even in your brain--

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.200 align:middle line:84%
with the C60, you've
got to make sure you've

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:10.120 align:middle line:84%
got pull that's going
to pull that out of you

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.900 align:middle line:84%
and excrete it out of your
bowels and out of your urine.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you've
got to be smart.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And nature's
solution to pollution

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:19.418 align:middle line:90%
is dilution-- drink more water.

00:39:19.418 --> 00:39:20.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I was going to ask that.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.397 align:middle line:90%
How much more water?

00:39:22.397 --> 00:39:23.980 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: I really
like, and recommend,

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.760 align:middle line:84%
that people drink three or four
liters of water a day as it is.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.620 align:middle line:84%
But that's a good
number for people

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:84%
who are like, OK, how much water
do I need to have in a day?

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's like measure out three
liters, measure out a gallon.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:90%
Like get the four liters in.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what's the study
showing about longevity

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.760 align:middle line:90%
and oxidative stress?

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.560 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: OK.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of the
theories about-- this

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
is what Fathi Moussa
posited about the C60.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:50.290 align:middle line:84%
What his position was he did
the toxicology study on the rats

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:51.670 align:middle line:90%
and doubled their lifespan.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:57.010 align:middle line:84%
His position was is that the
C60's bio availability and bio

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:02.200 align:middle line:84%
distribution in particular, and
its super antioxidant effects,

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.570 align:middle line:90%
is the reason for its longevity.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it induces
longevity in animals.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's a very
strong theory.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I went through, and I
went through like, OK,

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.470 align:middle line:84%
can we actually present
another antioxidant

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:17.260 align:middle line:84%
that's stronger than
the carbon 60 molecule?

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.370 align:middle line:90%
That's very unlikely.

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:22.000 align:middle line:84%
That's very, very difficult
to prove scientifically.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.867 align:middle line:84%
The C60 may be the strongest
antioxidant ever discovered.

00:40:26.867 --> 00:40:27.700 align:middle line:90%
Maybe they're right.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it is the fact that
it's activated charcoal's

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.090 align:middle line:84%
antioxidant
capabilities, carbon 60's

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.760 align:middle line:84%
antioxidant capabilities that
are really the reason why

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.750 align:middle line:90%
it's extending life.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Is there
anything I shouldn't

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:43.000 align:middle line:84%
be eating or consuming or
taking alongside the same time

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.940 align:middle line:84%
that I'm starting and trying to
extract this level of toxicity

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.230 align:middle line:90%
out of my system?

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:49.180 align:middle line:90%
What else might I need to know?

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That brings us
into oxygen and hydrogen.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:54.610 align:middle line:84%
For people who know my stuff,
the core basis of, I think,

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.700 align:middle line:84%
the legit and original
chemistry or alchemy--

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.310 align:middle line:84%
which today people are like,
no, we're doing chemistry

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and we're really
we're advanced now.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.310 align:middle line:84%
But are we really advanced
with all the toxic byproducts

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.110 align:middle line:90%
of our chemistry?

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.360 align:middle line:90%
Is that really an advancement?

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.570 align:middle line:90%
Is that really progress?

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And to my mind I go, no.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:09.670 align:middle line:90%
We've gone too far.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:11.140 align:middle line:90%
The alchemists warned us.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.632 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that alchemists
were juvenile chemists

00:41:13.632 --> 00:41:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and they were idiots,
and today everybody

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.810 align:middle line:84%
knows everything
about chemistry.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:84%
If you actually read
alchemical texts-- and I

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:22.913 align:middle line:84%
go to the Philosophical
Research Society in Los Angeles,

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:25.330 align:middle line:84%
where they have the largest
collection of alchemical books

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:27.020 align:middle line:90%
in the Western hemisphere.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.373 align:middle line:90%
And I study there.

00:41:28.373 --> 00:41:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of things I've found
from reading alchemical texts

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.300 align:middle line:84%
is that these people were
very, very smart, and much more

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.260 align:middle line:90%
advanced than chemists today.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you're taking,
for example, carbon.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.390 align:middle line:84%
This is so good--
this one is so good.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.810 align:middle line:84%
If you take in carbon
and C60 and you

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.320 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of carbon in
your system, you attract--

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.900 align:middle line:84%
it's a sexual attraction
of opposites--

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:53.013 align:middle line:90%
better quality oxygen to you.

00:41:53.013 --> 00:41:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Let me say that again.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:55.870 align:middle line:90%
I just want to emphasize that.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.890 align:middle line:90%
Carbon attracts oxygen to it.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.640 align:middle line:90%
They're oppositely charged.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Carbon is negatively
charged, like the earth.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.900 align:middle line:84%
Oxygen is positively
charged, like the atmosphere.

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And they are opposites
to each other.

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.150 align:middle line:84%
If you are a
concentrate of carbon,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:13.257 align:middle line:84%
the oxygen will go boom,
I'm coming to you first

00:42:13.257 --> 00:42:15.340 align:middle line:84%
before someone else, because
you have more carbon.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a sexual attraction.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.040 align:middle line:84%
And then that will give birth to
the child, and that's hydrogen.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:84%
Now that's the basis of
alchemical chemistry.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to bring this up
into normal chemistry circles

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and mainstream scientism,
because science has become

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:32.270 align:middle line:90%
almost like a religion now.

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:35.528 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you hear
this science is settled,

00:42:35.528 --> 00:42:37.070 align:middle line:84%
right there you know
there's trouble.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.903 align:middle line:84%
Because one thing we
know about science is--

00:42:38.903 --> 00:42:40.422 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's never finished.

00:42:40.422 --> 00:42:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: It's never finished.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.682 align:middle line:90%
It goes on.

00:42:42.682 --> 00:42:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I've got to go back,
because I know people are going

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to want to know I'm taking this
prescription drug that I have

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.570 align:middle line:84%
to take at this
point in my health,

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.668 align:middle line:84%
is this process going
to be safe for me?

00:42:52.668 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: That's such
a good question.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for asking
that question.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Hospitals recommend
two hours apart.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.378 align:middle line:84%
You could take--
let's say somebody

00:42:59.378 --> 00:43:00.590 align:middle line:90%
is on thyroid medication.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Hospitals recommend
taking the charcoal

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.600 align:middle line:84%
at least two hours apart
from the thyroid medication.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.805 align:middle line:84%
I recommend, from
experience, four hours.

00:43:08.805 --> 00:43:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Or even, if you
want to be safer,

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.513 align:middle line:90%
on the opposite side of the day.

00:43:11.513 --> 00:43:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Because can charcoal
neutralize medication?

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is
absolutely yes it can.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore certain
secondary alkaloids of herbs,

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:26.660 align:middle line:84%
pharmaceutical medication can
be neutralized by the charcoal.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.150 align:middle line:90%
And therefore we separate them.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.140 align:middle line:84%
That's why I recommend
let's get people

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.340 align:middle line:84%
on the charcoal in
the morning, and you

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.670 align:middle line:84%
don't have to think about
it the rest of the day.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:35.630 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe people take Synthroid
first thing in the morning.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.255 align:middle line:84%
I always recommend-- by the way,
even though I'm a vegetarian--

00:43:38.255 --> 00:43:42.352 align:middle line:84%
I recommend animal glandulars
before synthetic thyroid

00:43:42.352 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:90%
for people who need it.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.852 align:middle line:84%
Because I have a
very dear friend who

00:43:44.852 --> 00:43:46.240 align:middle line:84%
lives with me who
has no thyroid,

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and she has to be on
the animal glandulars

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:50.180 align:middle line:84%
because she feels better
and she doesn't build up

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.240 align:middle line:84%
the toxic thyroid metabolites
like the reverse T3

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.060 align:middle line:84%
and other problems that
Synthroid develops.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you do that, it has to
be apart from the charcoal.

00:43:59.390 --> 00:44:01.587 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Where can people
go to learn more?

00:44:01.587 --> 00:44:03.920 align:middle line:10%
>>WOLFE: This stuff has never
translated into books yet.

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.045 align:middle line:10%
It's not even in books yet.

00:44:05.045 --> 00:44:06.590 align:middle line:10%
So what I'd recommend,
if you really

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:09.380 align:middle line:10%
want to learn more from me,
is join my inner circle.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.893 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I make
available all my information

00:44:11.893 --> 00:44:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and all my research
and everything

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.558 align:middle line:84%
I've ever done in
my entire career.

00:44:15.558 --> 00:44:17.600 align:middle line:10%
And so you can always
track me down on Facebook--

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.390 align:middle line:10%

00:44:24.818 --> 00:44:27.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And the name of the
book that we can anticipate?

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.968 align:middle line:84%
>>WOLFE: "Charcoal, Activated
Charcoal, and Super Charcoals."

00:44:29.968 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you so much.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.580 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Thanks so much.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:31.790 align:middle line:90%
This was fun.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Amazing information.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:33.110 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Thank you.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:34.112 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Very fun.

00:44:34.112 --> 00:44:35.320 align:middle line:90%
You have a few things to say.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: A few things.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:38.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And I'm thrilled to be
able to share that with you

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:38.920 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.720 align:middle line:90%
>>WOLFE: Thanks.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.580 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:43.247 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I think it's so cool that
David is bringing this emerging

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:90%
science into the mainstream.

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.510 align:middle line:10%
Keep an eye out for
his upcoming book.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.130 align:middle line:84%
For many of us
looking to the future

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:53.240 align:middle line:84%
for anti-aging solutions, we
may wish to pause and research

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:56.750 align:middle line:84%
what discoveries in longevity
are emerging right now.

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Globally, humans have thrived
around the hearth or fire,

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.020 align:middle line:84%
so it should come as no
surprise that charcoal

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.960 align:middle line:84%
is a necessary piece
to preserving vitality.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.910 align:middle line:84%
The topics discussed
today are just

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.130 align:middle line:84%
a tiny bit of what
David Wolfe offers

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.760 align:middle line:90%
in the realm of wellness.
