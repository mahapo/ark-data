>>EDWARD GROUP: As we
are all aware by now,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:10%
hormone-sensitive cancers are
occurring at epidemic rates.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, one in seven women
are affected by breast cancer

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and one in three men are
affected by prostate cancer.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:84%
While there are numerous reasons
for the development of cancer,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.560 align:middle line:84%
something you might
not be aware of--

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:90%
and the research is clear--

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
is that iodine deficiency is
a major piece of the cancer

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.990 align:middle line:90%
puzzle.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Iodine deficiency
has been associated

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:84%
with other hormone-sensitive
cancers, including

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:84%
thyroid, ovarian, uterine, even
fibrocystic breast disease.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the reason we have
made so little progress

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:84%
in our treatment
of these cancers

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
is that the underlying
cause has been overlooked.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.190 align:middle line:84%
In this episode of our special
four part series with Dr. David

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Brownstein, we will
learn that iodide,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920 align:middle line:84%
which is effective
and inexpensive,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:84%
could be the key to help
solve a global health crisis.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.147 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Dr. Brownstein.

00:01:28.147 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID BROWNSTEIN:
Thank you for having me.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So iodine
has been shown

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.220 align:middle line:84%
to help out with different
types of cancers.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Can you explain?

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Iodine
is an essential element

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:10%
we can't live without.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:10%
It's concentrated in
the glandular tissue.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.780 align:middle line:10%
Every cell in the body needs
and requires iodine to survive.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:10%
But it's concentrated
in the glandular tissue

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:10%
against a gradient, which means
it's an ATP dependent process.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.180 align:middle line:84%
We utilize energy, and
it's so important we

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.670 align:middle line:84%
have to use our own energy
sources to move iodine

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.230 align:middle line:90%
into the glands.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So a problem develops
when the glands

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.973 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough iodine.

00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Now the glands, as you
mentioned in the intro,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
include the thyroid,
the ovaries, the uterus,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:84%
the breasts, the prostate,
and the pancreas.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Now we are suffering an
epidemic of glandular problem

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:90%
in our country.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.317 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned some of it--

00:02:14.317 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
the one in seven women
with breast cancer, the one

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and three men with
prostate cancer.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.040 align:middle line:90%
But think about it.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.665 align:middle line:84%
We're suffering with
epidemic increases

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.390 align:middle line:84%
of pancreatic, ovarian,
uterine cancer.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Thyroid cancer is the
fastest growing cancer

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.300 align:middle line:84%
When iodine concentrates
in the glandular tissue,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.990 align:middle line:84%
one of its main
jobs is to maintain

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
the normal architecture
of the glands.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So if we call this the amount
of iodine the glands need

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to maintain their
normal architecture,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.255 align:middle line:84%
an iodine deficiency, it sets in
motion problems for the glands.

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:10%
The first thing that
happens is you get

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.650 align:middle line:10%
cysts growing in the glands.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.530 align:middle line:10%
If it goes out longer, those
cysts become hard and nodular.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:10%
If it goes on longer, they
take a hyperplastic appearance

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.150 align:middle line:10%
under a microscope, which is
a precancerous appearance.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.563 align:middle line:84%
And the end stage is
cancer of those tissues.

00:02:56.563 --> 00:02:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Now this has been
shown in animal,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:90%
test tube, and human studies.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And in animal, test
tube, and human studies,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
iodine has been shown
to stop this progression

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and actually reverse
it at any stage.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So my research has clearly
shown that iodine deficiency

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.727 align:middle line:84%
is one of the major causes
of problems in these glands.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What about
other types of cancers?

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Have you noticed the iodine
deficiency associated

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.960 align:middle line:90%
with non-glandular tissue?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: The
research has, again, shown

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.590 align:middle line:84%
iodine deficiency associated
with other cancers,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.865 align:middle line:84%
from leukemia and lymphoma
cancers and some brain cancers.

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:34.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not clear if iodine's
the cause of that.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's definitely
associated with that.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.677 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, I would
think that it would probably

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.762 align:middle line:84%
be associated with everything
in some way, shape,

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
or form because iodine's needed
for every cell in the body,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.788 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: That's correct.

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:46.940 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in the body
needs and requires iodine.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.287 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Does iodine work
as an antioxidant as well?

00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Iodine one of
the most potent antioxidants

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
we know of, and it needs
to be in adequate amounts

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.385 align:middle line:90%
in the human body.

00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:58.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When we
talk about glandular,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.200 align:middle line:90%
we talk about hormones.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.467 align:middle line:84%
What is the relationship
between iodine and estrogens?

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So you can't
produce a hormone in the body

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:90%
without iodine in those glands.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
So that not only
includes thyroid hormone,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:84%
which everyone seems
to be aware of,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
but that includes
estrogen and progesterone

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:84%
and testosterone and
DHA and pregnenolone

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
and the rest of the
hormones in the body.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.019 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't
have enough iodine,

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:84%
the hormonal milieu
gets disrupted.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And one of the first
things I started

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:84%
to do at the beginning
of my holistic practice

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
was to treat people for
hormonal imbalances.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I was using bioidentical natural
hormones and particularly

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.380 align:middle line:84%
thyroid hormone for
a lot of patients.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.528 align:middle line:84%
Once I learned
about iodine, I was

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
able to lower the
amounts of hormones

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.640 align:middle line:84%
I needed to help patients
achieve their perfect balance.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.460 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: In women
with glandular cancers,

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:84%
are you seeing high
estrogen levels usually?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.030 align:middle line:84%
And how does that relate
to the increase in soy

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and phytoestrogens and
pesticides and insecticides?

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.725 align:middle line:84%
How are those disrupting
the hormones in women?

00:04:56.725 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN:
Well, I don't think

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
women are producing estrogen
to give themselves cancer.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there's
synthetic estrogens called

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
xenoestrogens in the
environment that's

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.570 align:middle line:84%
driving this high
estrogen rate in women.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And these xenoestrogens
are found in the animals

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.360 align:middle line:84%
that we're eating because they
put it in the food source.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:10%
They're chemicals
that mimic estrogens

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:10%
in pesticides and insecticides.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.590 align:middle line:10%
They're common chemicals
we put on our lawns,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:10%
and they're in plastics.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And the structure
of those chemicals

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.560 align:middle line:90%
mimic the estrogen molecule.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:84%
So when they get in our body,
which they unfortunately

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:84%
get in our body
pretty easily, they

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.660 align:middle line:84%
can bind to the estrogen
receptor and stimulate it.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And unlike natural hormones
that bind to our receptors

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:84%
and do their deeds and
then release very quickly,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:84%
these xenoestrogens
get stuck there,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:90%
and they continually stimulate.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
These things that we're seeing
with this are younger girls

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
are having their period
at an earlier age.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
Younger girls are developing
much faster and much larger

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:90%
than their mothers.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:84%
Each generation of women are
getting bigger breast size

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
than the previous generation.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.648 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's from
these xenoestrogens

00:05:58.648 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:90%
in the environment.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:84%
So what iodine's role
in this is iodine

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.610 align:middle line:84%
can help the body
detoxify from estrogen

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and can help increase the
metabolism of estrogen

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So Dr.
Brownstein, thyroid cancer

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is the number one
fastest growing cancer

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.940 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Breast cancer is
also rapidly rising.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Is there a relationship
between the two?

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Absolutely
there's a relationship.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Now I saw this relationship
in the first 10

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
years of my practice before
I learned about iodine.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And it came out in
two studies that

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.650 align:middle line:84%
compared women who take thyroid
medication versus women who

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
don't take thyroid medication
and their chances of getting

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.780 align:middle line:90%
breast cancer.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.360 align:middle line:84%
What both studies found
was that the longer

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that the women took thyroid
medication, the risk of breast

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:90%
cancer increased.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Particularly if women took
thyroid medication for 10 years

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.500 align:middle line:84%
or more, the risk of breast
cancer nearly doubled.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Now when I saw those
studies first come out,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.700 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't make sense of them.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:84%
I know a hypothyroid
state predisposes one

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.760 align:middle line:90%
to getting cancer.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
So why would taking thyroid
medication predispose one

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.610 align:middle line:90%
to getting cancer?

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.110 align:middle line:90%
You're treating the problem.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I would think cancer
rates should go down,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and certainly it
shouldn't go up.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.753 align:middle line:84%
I went through the studies
with a fine-tooth comb.

00:07:07.753 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:90%
I thought they were well done.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.630 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't figure it out.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Once I learned about iodine,
it came to me very easily

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.655 align:middle line:84%
that the reason women who
take thyroid medication

00:07:16.655 --> 00:07:18.280 align:middle line:84%
have an increased
risk of breast cancer

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.655 align:middle line:84%
after 10 years is they increase
their metabolic rate when

00:07:20.655 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:90%
they take thyroid hormone.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.790 align:middle line:84%
One of thyroid hormone's
main jobs in the body

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.370 align:middle line:84%
is to stimulate the cells
to produce more heat

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.460 align:middle line:84%
and to produce more energy, and
their metabolic rate goes up.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why women who don't
have enough thyroid hormone

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:33.590 align:middle line:90%
gain weight--

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.390 align:middle line:90%
and men.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.640 align:middle line:84%
They can gain weight,
and they become heavy.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.380 align:middle line:84%
So taking thyroid
hormone can help people

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.430 align:middle line:90%
maintain an optimal weight.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take thyroid
hormone for 10 years

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and you're deficient
in iodine, you

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.890 align:middle line:84%
make that iodine
deficiency problem worse.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Once the metabolic rate goes
up, your need for iodine

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:90%
goes up with it.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.807 align:middle line:84%
So they're basically
exacerbating an iron deficiency

00:07:53.807 --> 00:07:56.140 align:middle line:84%
problem that should have been
addressed at the beginning

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.252 align:middle line:84%
because perhaps
2/3 of those women

00:07:58.252 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
didn't need thyroid
hormone at all.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.240 align:middle line:90%
They just needed iodine.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Probably one third needed both.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.033 align:middle line:84%
But either way, it's
important, if you're

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:07.450 align:middle line:84%
going to go on thyroid hormone,
to have your iodine levels

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:84%
assessed at the same time
and either go on iodine first

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
or concurrently go on
iodine and thyroid together.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:84%
Now if you've already
been on thyroid hormone,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.072 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to worry
and get upset over it.

00:08:18.072 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's really important to
get your iodine levels checked

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.120 align:middle line:90%
and to start that therapy.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.420 align:middle line:84%
What I found in my practice the
first 10 years of just doing

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.510 align:middle line:84%
thyroid hormone
without iodine was

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.260 align:middle line:84%
that I had 3/4 of my patients
on small amounts of thyroid

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.370 align:middle line:90%
hormone.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.559 align:middle line:84%
After adding iodine
to the regimen,

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I now have one third of my
patients on thyroid hormone.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:40.559 align:middle line:84%
And those that are
on thyroid hormone

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I've been able to reduce
their dose in about half

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.766 align:middle line:90%
of what they were beforehand.

00:08:44.766 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And you were the
pioneer in that, right?

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.823 align:middle line:84%
There wasn't any scientific
data you could go to

00:08:49.823 --> 00:08:51.740 align:middle line:84%
and say, this is what
needs to be done, right?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.130 align:middle line:84%
You pretty much took that task
on yourself to research this.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.745 align:middle line:84%
And through a lot
of trial and error

00:08:58.745 --> 00:09:00.770 align:middle line:84%
or let's say working
with a lot of patients,

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.660 align:middle line:84%
you've kind of figured this
out on your own, right?

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: It was
very bothersome to me

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:84%
why when we just
get older, we need

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.538 align:middle line:90%
thyroid hormone to feel good.

00:09:06.538 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I never thought that was right.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.130 align:middle line:84%
I tried various
things, and nothing

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:84%
worked until I really got
the right form of iodine

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.160 align:middle line:90%
going with them.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So it was just a
good observation.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.720 align:middle line:84%
And just, I was unsettled
with doing things the way

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.100 align:middle line:90%
I was doing it.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So basically,
word of advice

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.010 align:middle line:84%
is if you have
thyroid condition,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
doctors shouldn't
really treat the thyroid

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
with thyroid hormone without
evaluating iodine deficiency as

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.140 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: That's right.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes you
need them both.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And many times you
just need iodine,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
and the thyroid
will rectify itself.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So why does
this lead to cancer?

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
What's the relationship
between the iodine, the thyroid

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.490 align:middle line:90%
hormones?

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.837 align:middle line:84%
What's the initiator
that causes the cancer?

00:09:49.837 --> 00:09:51.670 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
there's two things here.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.610 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
we just went through

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.370 align:middle line:84%
was when you go on thyroid
hormone, your metabolic rate

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:90%
increases.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.222 align:middle line:84%
That naturally increases
your need for more iodine.

00:10:00.222 --> 00:10:01.680 align:middle line:84%
If you're already
deficient, you're

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
going to be more
deficient in iodine.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.000 align:middle line:10%
And that goes back to
my previous description

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:10%
of iodine's needed for
the normal architecture

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:10%
of the glands.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:10%
If iodine's deficient,
you get cysts.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.670 align:middle line:84%
If it goes on longer, cysts
become hard and nodular.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:84%
Hyperplasia's the precursor
to cancer in those tissues.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And so taking thyroid hormone
can exacerbate and accelerate

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:90%
this continuum.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So basically
at the cellular level,

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.170 align:middle line:84%
you start having
abnormal cell function.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.370 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So speaking about
iodine and thyroid cancer,

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.760 align:middle line:84%
we have the pleasure of
speaking with a patient of Dr.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Brownstein's who
lived a nightmare when

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:84%
However, her fate changed
when she learned about iodine

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and met Dr. David Brownstein.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.020 align:middle line:84%
Joining us on
Skype is Stephanie.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:84%
Welcome, Stephanie, to
the "Healing Matrix."

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>>STEPHANIE: Hello.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm glad to be with you.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.667 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: When did
you first learn

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:56.910 align:middle line:90%
that your thyroid was abnormal?

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:10%
>>STEPHANIE: I actually learned
about it in March of 1999.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:10%
I just went for my annual
checkup with my doctor,

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:10%
and he did a lymphatic check
and said, oh, your thyroid's

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:10%
kind of swollen.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.900 align:middle line:84%
But that was the last
that he mentioned it,

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know what a
thyroid gland was at that point.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.520 align:middle line:84%
So I just ignored
it and went on.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And then about two weeks later,
I found out I was pregnant.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So nothing really happened
until after the baby was born.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I saw another doctor
who did a lymphatic check

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:84%
as part of his examination,
and he found a nodule

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.670 align:middle line:90%
on my thyroid.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I told him that I had
a follow-up appointment

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:84%
for my postpartum six weeks
with my OB/GYN the next week,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and I decided to just
have him check it out.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.360 align:middle line:84%
So he did find it as well, and
he ordered an ultrasound, which

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.730 align:middle line:90%
came back as a complex cyst.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Then he ordered a
nuclear med scan,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:90%
and then that was inconclusive.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.400 align:middle line:84%
So then he sent me to an
ear, nose, and throat doctor

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.330 align:middle line:84%
who did a fine
needle aspiration,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
and that result came back as
an abnormal follicular cells.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said, let's just
take out half your thyroid

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.750 align:middle line:90%
to just be sure.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Now I didn't know that a thyroid
gland was important to my body

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.480 align:middle line:84%
and that without
it, I wouldn't live.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:84%
I would have probably sought a
second opinion at that point.

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.140 align:middle line:84%
But just having had
a baby, being tired

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and not really knowing
what all this was,

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:90%
I just trusted my doctor.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:84%
And so I just followed
his advice at that point.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.500 align:middle line:84%
We scheduled the
surgery then for--

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.303 align:middle line:90%
it was March of 2000 then.

00:12:28.303 --> 00:12:29.970 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What was
going on in your mind

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.810 align:middle line:90%
emotionally during this time?

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, was there
any fear involved?

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:35.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, was there--

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.860 align:middle line:84%
you said that you didn't
really understand what

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:90%
the thyroid was at this time.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
you're pregnant.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:46.345 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are you, like, worried
or scared about any of this?

00:12:46.345 --> 00:12:47.720 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE: Oh
my goodness, yes.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.200 align:middle line:84%
Having a brand new baby really
changes your perspective

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:90%
on life.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.350 align:middle line:84%
But actually, at this point,
I didn't know I had cancer.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
It was just abnormal
cells, and they just

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
thought it would
be good to just get

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
rid of that half of my
thyroid just to be sure.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And so I wouldn't find out
that I had cancer until a month

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.320 align:middle line:84%
later when I went for my
stitches to be removed.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you go in to
get your stitches removed.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And how was that
presented to you?

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:84%
How did they actually diagnose
you with thyroid cancer?

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:90%
>>STEPHANIE: Sure.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:84%
So he kept telling me it's
probably nothing, probably

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:90%
nothing.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
He didn't even look at
the pathology report

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.457 align:middle line:90%
before I came in.

00:13:24.457 --> 00:13:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And so he took out
my stitches, and he

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.110 align:middle line:84%
said, let me go grab
that, comes back

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.390 align:middle line:84%
into the office or the
room that I was in.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.750 align:middle line:90%
He falls back against the wall.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.540 align:middle line:90%
I remember it as clear as day.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.910 align:middle line:90%
And he says to me, I'm sorry.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, you're sorry?

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, it was
papillary thyroid cancer,

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:84%
and it's spread to
your lymph nodes.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.212 align:middle line:90%
I just sat there stunned.

00:13:43.212 --> 00:13:45.420 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what to say
because I was just supposed

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.220 align:middle line:90%
to have my stitches out.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.973 align:middle line:84%
I looked down at my
four-month-old baby

00:13:48.973 --> 00:13:51.390 align:middle line:84%
on the floor and thought, what
in the world just happened?

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.800 align:middle line:90%
And he's like, no response?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking,
um, you just told

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I have cancer after telling
me it was probably nothing.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:90%
What am I supposed to say?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: What happens next?

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE: We
scheduled another--

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
or actually, I had to
go see a radiologist

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
because that was what he
determined was the best thing

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And he told us
that I had to have

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
the rest of my thyroid
taken out before I could

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.750 align:middle line:90%
go through radioactive iodine.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Part of that preparation was
to go off all your thyroid

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.840 align:middle line:84%
medication so that your
body's totally starved.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And I went through
that treatment,

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:90%
and it wasn't too bad.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.450 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it felt like a bad flu.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.390 align:middle line:84%
And then after I got done
with being in isolation--

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.750 align:middle line:84%
because, of course, you have
to be in isolation for 10 days

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
and that that meant I had to
be away from my baby for that

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.220 align:middle line:90%
long too because he was at risk.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.750 align:middle line:90%
They now send you home.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.270 align:middle line:84%
They used to keep you in
the hospital and isolate you

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and Geiger counter you when it
was safe for you to go home.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.042 align:middle line:90%
And now they just send you home.

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:48.750 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How many
times were you treated

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:90%
with radioactive iodine?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE: A total of three
over the next five years.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.440 align:middle line:84%
So my first one was
100 millicuries.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.240 align:middle line:90%
My second was 150 millicuries.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.260 align:middle line:90%
That one got done.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:90%
I thought we were finished.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.230 align:middle line:90%
My markers came down.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.460 align:middle line:90%
Everything looked great.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.500 align:middle line:84%
Again, I had to be
away from my son.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.873 align:middle line:90%
He told me for 30 days.

00:15:07.873 --> 00:15:09.290 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him
how I was supposed

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.050 align:middle line:84%
to care for my son being
away from him for 30 days.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I kid you not,
he said, put him

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
in a highchair in the corner
and throw some food at him,

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.450 align:middle line:90%
and he'll be fine.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
I left that office crying.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I called his office manager,
and I said, what's up with that?

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And she said, oh, honey,
that's just the way he is.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to
learn to deal with it.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.960 align:middle line:90%
I said, no way.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.430 align:middle line:84%
So I fired him and found
another endocrinologist.

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, where I
live, there are only three

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:90%
in my whole town.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
So I was going through
them fast here.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.180 align:middle line:90%
This doctor was really nice.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:90%
He was willing to work with me.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.900 align:middle line:90%
I was doing great.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:90%
I had my second child.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Everything was going great.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.120 align:middle line:90%
That was in 2002.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I started working
with a local chiropractor

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and naturopath who was
doing cleanses with me

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
and nutritional hormone
balancing, things like that.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:84%
My liver was actually
bulging out of my rib cage

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:90%
when I went to see him.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was feeling really good.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And I went back, and we ran
labs at my endrocrinologist.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:90%
And he said, uh-oh.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
He said, your cancer's
back because your markers

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:90%
are back up.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have to go
through radioactive iodine

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Now this is April of 2005.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:90%
And I said, are you sure?

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.630 align:middle line:84%
Because at this point,
I knew enough to know

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.895 align:middle line:84%
that my TSH had
increased a little bit,

00:16:24.895 --> 00:16:26.520 align:middle line:84%
and that would
stimulate thyroglobulin,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.290 align:middle line:90%
which is the marker they use.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.030 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, no, it's cancer.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.160 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back for
another round of radiation.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.250 align:middle line:90%
So once again, I let him do it.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I scheduled an appointment for
the radiation in May of 2005.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And I got 250 millicuries, which
put me at the end of my 500

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.013 align:middle line:90%
millicurie maximum for life.

00:16:48.013 --> 00:16:49.680 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What were
some of the symptoms

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.160 align:middle line:84%
that you were going through
after some of those treatments?

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm just
thinking about all

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
of the stress of having the
baby, having all of this stuff

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:90%
going on in your life.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.467 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain to somebody
what that felt like?

00:17:04.467 --> 00:17:06.300 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE: One of the
things that I really

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:90%
struggled with was anxiety.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never had
anxiety before.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And I remember shortly
after my son was born,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.890 align:middle line:84%
my girlfriend called me up,
and I just burst into tears.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And she came over right
away to be there with me.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.660 align:middle line:90%
But this happened a lot.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
And then I became that manic
mom that just could not

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:90%
handle any kind of noise.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And now I know that it
was my adrenals that

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:90%
were just tanking on me.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
was the most troubling.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And I did mention it to
my OB/GYN, and, of course,

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
he offered Zoloft, which
I didn't want any part of.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And I just kept
telling him, I said,

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't like this before
you took away my thyroid.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:90%
It has to be related.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.670 align:middle line:84%
They're like, no,
it's not related.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And my endocrinologist
would say,

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't deal in female hormones.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And my OB/GYN would
say, you're fine

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.620 align:middle line:84%
according to the labs
because you're in the range.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And I played this game for five
years, going back and forth

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and back and forth
to all the doctors.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, exactly who
is going to help me now?

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
this doctor's name

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.450 align:middle line:84%
that I had heard literally
five years earlier,

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:90%
and it was Dr. Brownstein.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And so I gave a call to his
office the following week

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.980 align:middle line:90%
and scheduled an appointment.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Now this was January,
keep in mind.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't get me
scheduled until August.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.357 align:middle line:84%
So I was kind of freaking
out at this point.

00:18:24.357 --> 00:18:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: It's so glad that you
did your own research on that.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.030 align:middle line:90%
You found Dr. Brownstein.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Did you know
anything about iodine

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:90%
before you met Dr. Brownstein?

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE: All I
knew about iodine was

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.300 align:middle line:84%
what I had been told because
I have a shellfish allergy.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And so I was told that
because I have this allergy,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.860 align:middle line:90%
I should never consume iodide.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.430 align:middle line:84%
Coincidentally, my
first endocrinologist,

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:84%
he did the urinary
iodine test before I

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:90%
had my radioactive iodine.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you had the
lowest level of iodine

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.800 align:middle line:84%
I have ever seen in
my whole practice.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- he's been in
practice for like 30 years.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.330 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, I thought,
wow, I really did well.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.270 align:middle line:90%
I followed the diet really well.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.660 align:middle line:84%
But now looking back, I'm like
no wonder I was in crisis.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
Enter Dr. Brownstein, who
was 180-degree difference.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Going
to Dr. Brownstein.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brownstein, when
Stephanie first came in,

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.227 align:middle line:84%
what was the first
thing you did for her?

00:19:19.227 --> 00:19:21.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Number
one, I listened to her.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.010 align:middle line:90%
I heard her story, and I was--

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I remember commenting
to her about iodine.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't you on iodine?

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And Stephanie told me
about her shellfish allergy

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and what the other
doctors said about it.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:35.030 align:middle line:84%
And I did make a comment to
Stephanie at that first visit.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember what
I told you, Stephanie?

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:90%
>>STEPHANIE: Yeah.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, he actually said
to me, don't worry,

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:90%
we'll get you well.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And he was the first
doctor that ever

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:90%
talked about wellness with me.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That's
huge when you look

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
at the vibrational
frequencies of the body

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
and how the healing
process takes place.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So I assume you tested
her for iodine right away.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:90%
What were the results of that?

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Oh, she was
incredibly deficient in iodine.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And I really thought
iodine could help her out,

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.202 align:middle line:84%
and I thought that might
have been the underlying

00:20:01.202 --> 00:20:02.460 align:middle line:90%
cause of all her troubles.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that papillary
thyroid cancer usually

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't kill people her age, and
it responds pretty well iodine

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.388 align:middle line:84%
I've treated lots
of people with it.

00:20:12.388 --> 00:20:14.430 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what happened
within the first week,

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
the first two weeks,
the first month

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.070 align:middle line:84%
of having Stephanie
on your program?

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.407 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So Stephanie,
why don't you tell him that?

00:20:21.407 --> 00:20:22.990 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE: So we
did a lot of things

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:24.660 align:middle line:90%
when I first went to see him.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
So it gets a little bit
difficult to separate out

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.480 align:middle line:90%
what did what.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.980 align:middle line:84%
But he did put me on 50
milligrams of iodine,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.470 align:middle line:84%
which I kind of freaked
out at, thinking,

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:36.210 align:middle line:90%
oh, no, this is a lot.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:10%
But I had to trust him.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:10%
Because at this point, I was
kind of at the end of my line.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:45.240 align:middle line:10%
And so we did desiccated
thyroid and iodine

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.100 align:middle line:10%
because I had been on Synthroid.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you, it was like a
light bulb went on in my brain.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And the joint pain that
I had that I was just

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.540 align:middle line:84%
told to live with just
started to melt away.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:10%
My energy went up.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.423 align:middle line:10%
It was amazing.

00:21:00.423 --> 00:21:02.340 align:middle line:10%
It was like I started
to feel like my old self

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.010 align:middle line:10%
again just in a few weeks.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I was like, why don't
other people know about this?

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
Why don't doctors practice
medicine like this?

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was really
frustrating looking back

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
on the five years
I had really lost.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How much
would you say you

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:84%
improved after the first
year of working with Dr. B?

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.420 align:middle line:84%
>>STEPHANIE: It didn't
even take that long.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.080 align:middle line:84%
I would say by the first
six to seven months,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I estimated maybe
75% to 80% better.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.740 align:middle line:84%
I'd never been able to
do anything with my kids.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:84%
By this point, they were
three and five years old.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And so by that summer, we were
able to go to the Detroit Zoo

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:90%
and walk the whole zoo.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was just totally
amazed because that

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.473 align:middle line:84%
would have laid me out flat
for a few days after that.

00:21:45.473 --> 00:21:46.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How are
you feeling now?

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.050 align:middle line:90%
You are cancer free, right?

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>STEPHANIE: I am since 2009.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It actually took three years,
which is important for people

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.730 align:middle line:84%
I think they're looking
for a quick fix.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.177 align:middle line:84%
And allopathic medicine kind
of promises that through drugs.

00:22:00.177 --> 00:22:02.760 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's just a blanket
that's getting thrown over it,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and you've not gotten
to the root cause.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.270 align:middle line:90%
But we did a lot of work.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I did a lot of nutritional
hormonal balancing.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:10.890 align:middle line:90%
I had my amalgams removed.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I had a root canal
tooth removed.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.190 align:middle line:90%
I did chelation.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:90%
I've done multiple detoxes.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's not just one thing.

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Iodine was a huge part of it.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.700 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, it was great
that he knew holistically

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:84%
how to treat me and how to
get my body back in balance.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.520 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked by the
number of labs he ran.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
But I was relieved
at the same time.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Because when I went to
visit these other doctors,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.720 align:middle line:84%
they ran a TSH, a T4, and a
thyroglobulin, and that was it.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.660 align:middle line:84%
They would deem me sick or
well based on those three labs.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:90%
And I knew better.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.770 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, the average
time spent with most physicians

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.420 align:middle line:90%
is less than seven minutes.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And a doctor truly is a teacher,
not a prescriber, and a coach.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.380 align:middle line:90%
Dr. B, is this--

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.445 align:middle line:84%
how many other patients are like
Stephanie that you've treated?

00:22:58.445 --> 00:23:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I've treated
many patients like this.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.590 align:middle line:10%
And when I told Stephanie
I thought she'd be well,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.480 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't just trying
to give her false hope.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I really thought she'd
get better with this,

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
and I thought they were
missing the underlying

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:90%
cause of the problem.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.250 align:middle line:84%
But many patients like this,
she's an example of my practice

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.932 align:middle line:90%
and who me and my partner see.

00:23:16.932 --> 00:23:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Well
Stephanie, thank you

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:84%
so much for coming on
and sharing your story.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.512 align:middle line:84%
We wish you a long,
healthy, and happy life.

00:23:24.512 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>STEPHANIE: Thank you.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm at 20 years this year.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.897 align:middle line:90%
So I'm glad.

00:23:27.897 --> 00:23:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Congratulations.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Congratulations.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.113 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Thanks, Stephanie.

00:23:31.113 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:90%
>>STEPHANIE: Thanks.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Dr. Bernstein,
should radioactive

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
iodine be used as a last
resort with somebody suffering

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.090 align:middle line:90%
from thyroid cancer?

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Only as the very
last, last, last, last resort.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.160 align:middle line:84%
After 25 years of
treating patients,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.070 align:middle line:84%
I've never recommended anyone
for radioactive iodine.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's better
ways to treat this

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:51.480 align:middle line:84%
than using radioactive
iodine, and that's

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.110 align:middle line:84%
with a holistic
treatment regimen.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Great.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I do want to point out that
your treatment approach is

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:90%
a holistic approach.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.270 align:middle line:84%
You pay a lot of attention
to the patient's environment,

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
the patient's dietary
factors, supplementation.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.460 align:middle line:90%
So it's not only iodine.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a full holistic
approach, custom designed

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:90%
for each patient, right?

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Every patient's a
unique biochemical individual.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.030 align:middle line:84%
And they all need
different things.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:90%
They need what they need.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:84%
So iodine's a great
treatment, but it

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.330 align:middle line:84%
should be best used as part of
a holistic treatment regimen

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.400 align:middle line:90%
to get the best results.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.740 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You've touched on
breast cancer a little bit.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.760 align:middle line:84%
What is the link between breast
cancer, iodine deficiency,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.322 align:middle line:90%
and diabetes?

00:24:32.322 --> 00:24:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Iodine
concentrates in the breast

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.655 align:middle line:84%
just like it does
in the thyroid.

00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:38.270 align:middle line:84%
The same mechanism of
concentrating iodine

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in the thyroid has been shown
to occur in the breast tissue.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
So deficiencies in
iodine in the breast

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:48.080 align:middle line:84%
results in problems with
disrupted architecture, cysts,

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.210 align:middle line:84%
nodules, hyperplasia,
and cancer.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And also, keep in mind
that iodine deficiency

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.240 align:middle line:84%
causes hypertrophy of
these glandular tissues.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.105 align:middle line:90%
They get bigger.

00:24:57.105 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
So they can get a
goiter in their neck.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.440 align:middle line:90%
That's also a problem, too.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So with diabetes, the
situation is exacerbated

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.960 align:middle line:84%
because there's not enough
iodine in the pancreas to cause

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:90%
the pancreas to make insulin.

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:84%
They become diabetic, and
it creates a whole oxidative

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:84%
problem in the body and
just worsens any condition

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.390 align:middle line:90%
that we're dealing with.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Do you
think the incidents

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.080 align:middle line:84%
of breast cancer in
the last two decades,

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.030 align:middle line:84%
why it's rising so
rapidly, is not only

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.430 align:middle line:84%
because of iodine deficiency
but because of all

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
these other chemicals
and toxins that we're

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:90%
exposed to on a regular basis?

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:33.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So if we look at
this question like a big pie,

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.683 align:middle line:84%
what percentage-- what
slice of the pie is iodine,

00:25:35.683 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:84%
iodine's a large
slice of the pie,

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.880 align:middle line:90%
but it's not the whole pie.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.190 align:middle line:90%
There's toxins.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.663 align:middle line:90%
There's nutrient deficiencies.

00:25:41.663 --> 00:25:43.580 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole bunch
of things going on here.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So the more things you can do,
the more holistic treatments

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.180 align:middle line:90%
you can do--

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.730 align:middle line:84%
detoxification, correct
nutrient imbalances,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.670 align:middle line:84%
balance the other hormones, get
rid of fillings in the mouth,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:90%
like Stephanie talked about--

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:56.932 align:middle line:84%
all that stuff helps
and should be done.

00:25:56.932 --> 00:25:58.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you
mentioned multiple times

00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:90%
fibrocystic breast disease.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: The
reason I keep mentioning

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.920 align:middle line:84%
it is because it's
so common out there.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.510 align:middle line:84%
It's estimated that over
80% of women in the US

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:08.330 align:middle line:90%
have fibrocystic breast disease.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Fibrocystic breast disease
is that first signal

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:90%
that iodine levels are off.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.590 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I see a woman with
fibrocystic breast disease,

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.140 align:middle line:84%
I tell her, you have
iodine efficiency, period.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And very rarely does iodine fail
me at improving or resolving

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.470 align:middle line:84%
the fibrocystic
breast disease, just

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.860 align:middle line:84%
as we talked about with Mary
Ann in the earlier show.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what is the
role of bromide, bromine,

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.410 align:middle line:90%
fluoride in breast cancer?

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
just as iodine gets

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:84%
absorbed into breast tissue,
if iodine is deficient,

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.440 align:middle line:84%
bromide and fluoride
can take its place.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Bromide and fluoride are
non-essential elements

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.500 align:middle line:90%
that are toxic to the body.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.030 align:middle line:84%
We know that they can
promote carcinogenic effects.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same struggle
with the thyroid, same struggle

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.350 align:middle line:90%
with the ovaries and the uterus.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.270 align:middle line:84%
So we need iodine to
competitively inhibit out

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
those things from the
breasts, from the ovaries,

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:84%
from the thyroid, from the
uterus, from the prostate.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:90%
It's the same mechanism.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind, I said earlier
that our iodine requirements

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.820 align:middle line:84%
are higher than
our predecessors.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.612 align:middle line:84%
They're higher than
our parents at our age.

00:27:09.612 --> 00:27:11.153 align:middle line:84%
They're higher than
our grandparents.

00:27:11.153 --> 00:27:13.190 align:middle line:84%
They're higher than
our great grandparents.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So we need more iodine
in our toxic world

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.837 align:middle line:90%
we live in than they did.

00:27:16.837 --> 00:27:18.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And we haven't
talked too much about men

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.740 align:middle line:90%
during this show.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.600 align:middle line:90%
But you mentioned the prostate.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.560 align:middle line:84%
The toxic halides-- bromide,
fluoride-- is that also toxic

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.540 align:middle line:90%
to all glandular tissue?

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And what have you
noticed in men?

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.570 align:middle line:90%
Have you been treating men?

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Have you been seeing
more of an epidemic

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.275 align:middle line:90%
with prostate conditions?

00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
I've been seeing

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:41.420 align:middle line:84%
more and more men
with prostate cancer

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and more and more younger
men with prostate cancer.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.180 align:middle line:84%
When I was getting out of
my training 25 years ago,

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.138 align:middle line:84%
you didn't see young men
with prostate cancer.

00:27:49.138 --> 00:27:50.930 align:middle line:84%
You're seeing old men
with prostate cancer.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Now you're seeing
young men with it.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's becoming a bigger
problem and a younger problem.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same issue.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:01.040 align:middle line:84%
The prostate can get cysts,
nodules, hyperplasia, cancer.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.480 align:middle line:84%
And iodine should be part
of everyone's regimen

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.450 align:middle line:84%
right now to buffer
that continuum.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.250 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Have you
had individual males

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:13.120 align:middle line:84%
with, let's say, benign
prostatic hypertrophy, which

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.740 align:middle line:84%
you would say
would be an earlier

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
stage like fibrocystic
breast disease in women

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.780 align:middle line:90%
to leading to prostate cancer?

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen good results with
your holistic treatment plan

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.280 align:middle line:90%
and putting them on iodine?

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Yes.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.450 align:middle line:10%
And I've seen men with
early stage prostate cancer

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.790 align:middle line:10%
be able to slow down
their rate of PSA rise

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.410 align:middle line:10%
and really stabilize things
with this holistic treatment

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:34.210 align:middle line:10%
regimen.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.640 align:middle line:84%
That includes decent
amounts of iodine.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.600 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You mentioned
xenoestrogens earlier,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and I know this
affects women and men.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.570 align:middle line:84%
Can you expand on xenoestrogens
and give individuals out

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.900 align:middle line:84%
there maybe some tips of
where they're coming from

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.413 align:middle line:90%
and how to avoid them?

00:28:52.413 --> 00:28:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
xenoestrogens are

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:56.030 align:middle line:84%
estrogen mimics in
the environment.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.150 align:middle line:84%
They have a chemical structure
similar to estrogens.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.270 align:middle line:84%
So they can bind to
the estrogen receptor.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Because they're different,
they're foreign substances,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:84%
our body doesn't know
how to clear them.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.360 align:middle line:84%
Normally, estrogen
binds to the receptor

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:90%
in a short period of time.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:84%
After it produces a protein,
it releases from the receptor.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.600 align:middle line:84%
The xenoestrogens get
stuck on the receptor

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.055 align:middle line:90%
and constantly stimulate.

00:29:15.055 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're getting
this abnormal growth

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:90%
in these tissues.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways you
can avoid xenoestrogens

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.865 align:middle line:90%
is eat organic food.

00:29:22.865 --> 00:29:24.490 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
eat animal products,

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.060 align:middle line:84%
eat animals that haven't been
fed synthetic hormones that act

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.080 align:middle line:90%
like xenoestrogens in the body.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Try not eat food in plastics
and heat food in plastics.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Plastics can absorb
into hot food

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and stimulate
estrogen receptors.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.257 align:middle line:84%
Don't put plastics
in the microwave.

00:29:39.257 --> 00:29:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Don't put Saran Wrap
in the microwave.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
Don't put Saran
Wrap over hot food.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Stuff like that can help.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:46.482 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:29:46.482 --> 00:29:47.690 align:middle line:90%
But we can make a difference.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's another
reason why people

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.880 align:middle line:84%
need to detox and need to
clean things out and keep

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.435 align:middle line:90%
the liver clean.

00:29:53.435 --> 00:29:55.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the liver's main jobs
is to act like an oil filter

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.220 align:middle line:90%
and keep the blood clean.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.440 align:middle line:84%
When that oil filter of
the liver gets plugged,

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:90%
the blood starts getting messy.

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:90%
The hormones get messy.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The liver needs to be
detoxed periodically

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.817 align:middle line:90%
in our toxic world.

00:30:06.817 --> 00:30:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You say toxic
world, and we're basically

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.550 align:middle line:84%
spraying toxic chemicals on
all of our foods these days.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:84%
You have atrazine,
glyphosate, perchlorate.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.010 align:middle line:84%
You have pesticides,
insecticides

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.400 align:middle line:84%
on practically everything these
days, including organic foods.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.610 align:middle line:84%
How does that affect
glandular tissue?

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And how does that affect
an iodine deficiency?

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
most of the pesticides

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.170 align:middle line:84%
contain bromide and fluoride
as part of their makeup,

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.132 align:middle line:90%
their chemical makeup.

00:30:31.132 --> 00:30:33.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's going to affect the
glandular tissue right there.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.943 align:middle line:90%
We have to detox.

00:30:34.943 --> 00:30:36.360 align:middle line:84%
We have to take
care of ourselves.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.440 align:middle line:84%
We have to try and eat organic
foods to avoid this stuff.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Autoimmune diseases.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:84%
I know you've
talked about this--

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Graves' disease, but not
only Graves' disease,

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.950 align:middle line:84%
just autoimmune
diseases in general.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to me, it's like a label
they put on anything that they

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.170 align:middle line:90%
don't know what's going on.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.360 align:middle line:90%
It's just an autoimmune disease.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us about some of
your more recent research, some

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.640 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
you found dealing

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.530 align:middle line:84%
with autoimmune diseases,
whether it's linked

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:02.787 align:middle line:90%
to iodine deficiency or not?

00:31:02.787 --> 00:31:04.245 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
autoimmune disease

00:31:04.245 --> 00:31:06.930 align:middle line:84%
is occurring at epidemic
rates right now.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Conventional medicine does
not have an answer for that.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:middle line:84%
They use toxic
drugs that basically

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.850 align:middle line:84%
block the immune system
from functioning.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, when
you see the ads on TV,

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.840 align:middle line:84%
all the ads are you're at risk
of serious infection like TB

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.940 align:middle line:84%
and and terrible
infections coming back

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.083 align:middle line:90%
that we took care of years ago.

00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:24.750 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think it's
natural for people

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.875 align:middle line:90%
to get autoimmune diseases.

00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:27.780 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't be
producing antibodies that

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.490 align:middle line:90%
are attacking your own cells.

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.380 align:middle line:84%
Something is wrong
with our own cells

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that the body is sensing and
is trying to get rid of them.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.170 align:middle line:84%
But just attacking
the immune system

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.130 align:middle line:90%
isn't the right style for this.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.430 align:middle line:84%
We need to go to the
underlying cause of that.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Now iodine's part of
that because iodine

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.568 align:middle line:84%
is needed by every
cell in the body,

00:31:45.568 --> 00:31:47.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's needed for normal
structure and function

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.670 align:middle line:90%
of the cell.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:53.310 align:middle line:84%
So iodine, detoxification,
drinking water,

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:84%
getting your vitamins
and minerals rebalanced,

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:58.540 align:middle line:84%
getting your hormonal system
balanced, all that stuff helps.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you have an
autoimmune disease,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.180 align:middle line:84%
I would say it's best to work
with a holistic doctor who's

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.160 align:middle line:90%
familiar with this stuff.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So can you
explain to people

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:84%
what exactly is Graves'
disease and how did it

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.350 align:middle line:90%
get that name Graves' disease?

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So Graves' disease
is an autoimmune condition

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.870 align:middle line:84%
of the thyroid where there's
an inflammatory problem

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.490 align:middle line:84%
with the thyroid
going on, and there's

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of thyroid
hormone being produced.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.830 align:middle line:84%
These are the people that are
nervous, jittery, palpitations.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.627 align:middle line:10%
They have the bulging eyes
out of their eye sockets.

00:32:27.627 --> 00:32:29.210 align:middle line:84%
They're losing weight
when they're not

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.320 align:middle line:90%
trying to lose weight.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Graves' disease makes
people miserable.

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Now I was taught
in medical school

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.950 align:middle line:84%
there's no real known
reason for Graves' disease.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:40.970 align:middle line:84%
But it was mentioned that
maybe iodine caused it.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But nobody's taking
iodine out there,

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.140 align:middle line:84%
and Graves' disease
was going up, up and up

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.640 align:middle line:90%
and up every year.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.640 align:middle line:84%
So what we found is that if
iodine levels have fallen

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.603 align:middle line:84%
across the United States
over the last 40 to 50 years,

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:54.020 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune thyroid
conditions have

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.670 align:middle line:90%
increased at epidemic rates.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Graves' and Hashimoto's
have gone up.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that's a
negative correlation.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.170 align:middle line:84%
Graves' and Hashimoto's
were going up and thyroid

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.610 align:middle line:90%
levels going down.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.880 align:middle line:84%
For those that say that iodine
causes Graves' and Hashimoto's

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.948 align:middle line:84%
disease, that is disproved
by that simple fact.

00:33:11.948 --> 00:33:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what is the
difference between Hashimoto's

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.520 align:middle line:90%
and Graves' disease?

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.478 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
they're different illnesses

00:33:17.478 --> 00:33:20.270 align:middle line:84%
that are diagnosed with a
sample of the thyroid tissue.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.628 align:middle line:84%
But Hashimoto's disease
is when the lymphocytes,

00:33:22.628 --> 00:33:24.920 align:middle line:84%
certain white blood cells,
attack the thyroid and cause

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:90%
inflammation.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And my feeling is it's
the same underlying

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.120 align:middle line:84%
cause as iodine
deficiency coupled

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.310 align:middle line:84%
with the other toxicities
that we're having.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how
different are the symptoms

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:90%
of Hashimoto's versus Graves'?

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:43.910 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Hashimoto's can
cause a hyperthyroid symptom

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.490 align:middle line:84%
as well, such as nervous,
jittery, and palpitations.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And it can also cause
hypothyroidism symptoms,

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.450 align:middle line:84%
such as fatigue, weight
gain, and hair loss.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.060 align:middle line:90%
So that can go either way.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.360 align:middle line:84%
Graves' primarily just does
that fast palpitations,

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:90%
nervous, jittery symptoms.

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: With your
experience, let's say

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:84%
somebody is experiencing
cold hands and feet.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.450 align:middle line:84%
They're feeling
fatigued, weight gain.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.020 align:middle line:84%
They go to their
general practitioner.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:12.320 align:middle line:84%
How does a general
practitioner diagnose them

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.860 align:middle line:84%
with Graves' or Hashimoto's
or thyroid disease?

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And are they doing
it the right way,

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.655 align:middle line:84%
or are they doing
it the wrong way?

00:34:19.655 --> 00:34:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I was
trained in medical school

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.139 align:middle line:84%
back in the day to
just draw a TSH test.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:26.347 align:middle line:84%
If that TSH each
test was normal,

00:34:26.347 --> 00:34:27.889 align:middle line:84%
you told them it
wasn't your thyroid,

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:29.690 align:middle line:90%
and you sent them away.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.400 align:middle line:84%
Generally, you're
going to give them

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:84%
another prescription
and an antidepressant

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.650 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But now they're checking
TSH and T4 levels.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.640 align:middle line:84%
If those are normal,
they're telling the patients

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.440 align:middle line:90%
the same thing.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.639 align:middle line:90%
It's not your thyroid.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:45.920 align:middle line:84%
It's something else,
and probably giving them

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.060 align:middle line:90%
an antidepressant out the door.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.585 align:middle line:84%
So there are many more thyroid
tests that should be checked.

00:34:50.585 --> 00:34:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going to
do a thorough analysis

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
of the thyroid, I
believe you need

00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to check TSH levels, free
T4s, free T3s, reverse T3,

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.070 align:middle line:90%
and thyroid antibodies.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's a more comprehensive
way to diagnose a problem.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Conventional doctors generally
will miss Hashimoto's diagnoses

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.820 align:middle line:84%
because they don't
do the full testing.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And Hashimoto's is
increasing at epidemic rates.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Because in my practice,
we all check it this way,

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.940 align:middle line:90%
and we see it.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Talking about
Hashimoto's, I mean,

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:23.840 align:middle line:84%
the huge controversial issue
out there is if you have

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Hashimoto's, you
cannot take iodine.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.350 align:middle line:90%
What do you say about that?

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, I've heard
that from conventional doctors.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.110 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that from
holistic doctors.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:36.500 align:middle line:84%
I've had bombs thrown at me
on the internet from that.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I say to those people
is, as Ricky said to Lucy,

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.160 align:middle line:90%
'splain this.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:84%
'Splain how as iodine levels
have fallen 50-plus percent

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.300 align:middle line:84%
over the last 40 years,
Hashimoto's has gone up

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.680 align:middle line:90%
at epidemic rates.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.490 align:middle line:84%
They don't correlate
with one another.

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, iodine does
not cause Hashimoto's.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.660 align:middle line:84%
Now you could say
iodine deficiency causes

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Hashimoto's like I do because
that would explain those two

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.710 align:middle line:84%
graphs that are going in
a different direction.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:06.088 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So you actually use
iodine to treat Hashimoto's.

00:36:06.088 --> 00:36:08.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So Hashimoto's--
I write about this in my book,

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.853 align:middle line:84%
and I lecture to
doctors about this.

00:36:10.853 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the
hardest topics for doctors

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.190 align:middle line:90%
to get their hands around.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's the only thing
that could explain

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:18.860 align:middle line:84%
this declining iodine level
and rising Hashimoto's

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:90%
level over the last 50 years.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Now you can't get Hashimoto's
or Graves' disease

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:26.570 align:middle line:90%
without some iodine.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.663 align:middle line:84%
The thyroid need some
iodine to do anything.

00:36:28.663 --> 00:36:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it would
just collapse,

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and you would have
nothing with it.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
But I show a
mechanism in my book,

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and I teach doctors
very distinctly,

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and it takes a couple of hours
to go through step by step

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.290 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism of
how low iodine sets

00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the stage for autoimmune
problems in the thyroid.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: By the way,
you mentioned your book.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:51.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a fantastic book
that Dr. Brownstein wrote.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's called "Iodine--

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.390 align:middle line:84%
Why You Need It, Why You
Can't Live Without It."

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:90%
And that is so true.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.990 align:middle line:84%
This is a fantastic
book, and it's

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.930 align:middle line:84%
written in a way that's
very easy to understand.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And it goes over
all the symptoms.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.010 align:middle line:84%
It goes over the
benefits of iodine.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend
that you get this book.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.030 align:middle line:84%

Dr. Brownstein, how can

How can they learn
more about what you do?

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Where can they go to absorb
