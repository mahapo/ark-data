>>EDWARD GROUP: For years,
we've heard the following.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.950 align:middle line:10%
A low salt diet is healthy.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:10%
There's no difference between
table salt and sea salt.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.390 align:middle line:84%
Refined salt is
healthier for you.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.420 align:middle line:84%
Low salt products
are better for you.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:84%
These statements
are believed to be

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.690 align:middle line:84%
true by not only laypeople
but also most physicians

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
when, in actuality, these
statements are false.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
On today's special episode of
"Healing Matrix," Dr. David

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Brownstein, the author of
"Salt Your Way to Health,"

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
joins us to explain why
these so-called facts are not

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
only incorrect, but
that without salt, life

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:90%
itself would not be possible.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Plus, later on in the show,
we discuss the importance

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:84%
of supplements like B12, ozone
therapy, and other elements

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:90%
of a holistic plan.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:90%
So let's dive in.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.237 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Dr. Brownstein,
for joining us today.

00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:21.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DAVID BROWNSTEIN:
Thank you for having me.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So everybody's
been so misinformed.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.357 align:middle line:90%
What is the truth about salt?

00:01:25.357 --> 00:01:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
in medical school,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I was taught no one
should have salt.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.140 align:middle line:10%
There's enough salt in food.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:10%
And if you have
salt, you're going

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.980 align:middle line:10%
to get blood pressure
problems from salt.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:10%
And once I started actually
looking at patients

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.110 align:middle line:10%
holistically, I found
the vast majority of them

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.180 align:middle line:10%
are actually deficient
in salt, and salt

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.480 align:middle line:10%
is a major constituent in the
body we can't live without.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.565 align:middle line:84%
So I am all the time
telling my patients

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.490 align:middle line:84%
to up their salt levels and
to use the right kind of salt.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.170 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how did
all this knowledge

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:84%
of salt all of a sudden
go out the window

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.007 align:middle line:84%
and it went from being
good to being bad?

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: This goes
back about a hundred years

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
when researchers were
investigating how salt

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.910 align:middle line:90%
interacts with blood pressure.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
And they gave rats
huge amounts of salt

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.762 align:middle line:84%
that we would never ingest
in equivalent amounts.

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And what they found was the
blood pressure of these animals

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:90%
went up very high.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the salt equals
blood pressure problems came

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.890 align:middle line:90%
out.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And from that time, there was
a push in the medical world

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.120 align:middle line:84%
to keep salt levels low so
people's blood pressures didn't

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.810 align:middle line:90%
go up.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.030 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what exactly is the
difference between refined salt

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:90%
versus unrefined salt?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.430 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, salt is
the second major constituent

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.240 align:middle line:90%
in our body next to water.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So we need adequate amounts
of salt at all times

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:84%
to maintain optimal energy
production and optimal

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.190 align:middle line:90%
function of ourselves.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So when we're salt
deficient, our cells

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to function
well, and we're not

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:90%
going to have enough energy.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And we can get salt one
of two ways-- refined

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.562 align:middle line:84%
salt or unrefined
salt. Now refined

00:02:54.562 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:90%
salt we're all familiar with.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.650 align:middle line:84%
That's the little
thin white crystals

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:84%
seen in all the
restaurants, and they pour

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.230 align:middle line:90%
through the small little holes.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And unrefined salt is larger,
and it's got some color to it.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.070 align:middle line:84%
The color and the larger
size is due to the minerals

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:90%
that are in salt.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:90%
All salt has minerals in it.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And it depends if the salt
manufacturing companies

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:90%
are going to refine it or not.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
When they refine it,
they remove the minerals,

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and they refer to those
minerals as impurities.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.780 align:middle line:84%
And they bleach it white, and
they call that refined salt.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.765 align:middle line:84%
I call that a unhealthy
salt. That's sodium

00:03:27.765 --> 00:03:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and chloride with some
toxic chemicals in it,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
such as ferrocyanide
and aluminum silicate.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
Unrefined salt is
a better choice.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.400 align:middle line:84%
It's got a full complement
of minerals in it,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.870 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't have
toxic additives to it.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Why do you think
they're refining salt?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
It seems like you
can get natural salt

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:90%
with the minerals in it.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.140 align:middle line:84%
It seems like you're just
taking all kinds of extra steps,

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.778 align:middle line:84%
and it's costing you more
money and time to refine it.

00:03:51.778 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:90%
What's the purpose behind that?

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
one of the purposes--

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.610 align:middle line:84%
like, they refine everything
because it lasts forever.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And it can stay on
the shelves forever.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.160 align:middle line:84%
There's no expiration date
of any refined product.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is the
salt manufacturers have--

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
they think that we think it's
a pure substance because it's

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
white and there's
no color to it.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tell my patients
avoid the white salt

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:84%
and get the salt that has
some color to it because that

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.790 align:middle line:90%
means it has minerals in it.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What about the
iodine added to refined salt?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.188 align:middle line:90%
Are they still doing that?

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Oh,
they're still doing that.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.513 align:middle line:84%
That was done in the early
1920s to help cure the goiter

00:04:26.513 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
epidemic that was occurring
in the midwestern United

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.960 align:middle line:90%
States around the Great Lakes.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.353 align:middle line:84%
And when the government
found that most of the people

00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
were deficient in
iodine, they had

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to get
iodine in for a population.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.930 align:middle line:90%
And so salt is one of the ways.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:84%
You can put iodine into refined
salt, and you get iodized salt.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And that was an effective
public health miracle

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.540 align:middle line:84%
back then because it
cured the goiter epidemic.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:84%
However, it caused people to
have more mineral deficiencies

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
and imbalances because
we took the minerals out

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.300 align:middle line:90%
of that refined salt.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.810 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So talk about what
happens when we consume sodium.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, we need
over a hundred grams of sodium

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:90%
at any one time in our body.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, we need over a
hundred grams of chloride

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:90%
at any one time in our body.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So what happens when
we consume sodium?

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
It's used for hundreds
of different reactions.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
It's used to make energy
molecules in the body.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
It's used to transport iodine
into the cells of the body.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:90%
We need sodium to survive.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.410 align:middle line:84%
Our cells need
sodium to survive,

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and they need a fair amount
of sodium to survive.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:84%
We have no stores of
salt. We have no stores

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.860 align:middle line:90%
of sodium nor chloride.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.412 align:middle line:84%
If we don't get adequate
amounts in, we'll be deficient.

00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
from testing thousands

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:84%
of people over many years, most
people are deficient in salt.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.180 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: The unrefined
salt, I'm a big fan.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
It contains so many of
the life-giving minerals.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:90%
What are some of those minerals?

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.903 align:middle line:84%
And how many minerals do you
look for in unrefined salt?

00:05:47.903 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
unrefined salt

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.160 align:middle line:10%
has over 80 minerals in it.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:10%
And these minerals are
all needed by our body.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.500 align:middle line:10%
And magnesium-- there's zinc.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.320 align:middle line:10%
There is boron.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.230 align:middle line:10%
There's over 80 essential
minerals in that substance

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:10%
that we need.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Refined salt has
no minerals in it.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.690 align:middle line:84%
It's got sodium and chloride
with some toxic additives

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.810 align:middle line:84%
to it as well and iodine
synthetically added to it.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Now the iodine in refined
salt is not a great way

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.760 align:middle line:90%
to get iodine in the body.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
Studies have shown
only about 10%

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.380 align:middle line:84%
of the iodine in refined
salt is absorbed.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a great way
to put iodine in a body.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
If we were going to do iodine,
like you and I talked about

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.100 align:middle line:84%
in the other episodes,
we should take it orally

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.930 align:middle line:90%
as a separate supplement.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I'm thinking about
salt, and pH comes to mind.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And the individuals that are
using refined versus unrefined,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.460 align:middle line:84%
have you noticed any
differences in pH changes?

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.840 align:middle line:84%
So my daughter, Jessica, in
her sixth grade science project

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.050 align:middle line:84%
was developing her
own science project.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And she had known about my
work with iodine and salt.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.720 align:middle line:84%
And she designed a
whole science project

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
to look at the pH difference
between refined and unrefined

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:90%
salt.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So she put a certain amount
in two glasses of water,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.800 align:middle line:90%
and we measured the pH.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And what we found
was the refined salt

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:90%
acidified the water product.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And the unrefined salt
alkalinized and normalized it,

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:90%
raised the pH of it.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we eat poor foods
and refined foods and foods

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
that are unhealthy for
us, they usually acidify,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.225 align:middle line:90%
and they lower pH.

00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.600 align:middle line:84%
When we eat
healthier foods, they

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.020 align:middle line:84%
raise our pH to more healthy
pH and alkalinize us.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.477 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how can a low
salt diet raise blood pressure?

00:07:22.477 --> 00:07:24.810 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, if you
recall from our doctor school

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.170 align:middle line:84%
training, when we
lower the salt intake,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.380 align:middle line:84%
the kidney and adrenal glands
have compensatory hormones

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.020 align:middle line:84%
they release, such as
renin and aldosterone,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.700 align:middle line:84%
that go up because
the body needs

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.950 align:middle line:84%
salt. Every cell in
the body needs salt.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's a crucial substance.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.818 align:middle line:84%
There's all these
hormones that are

00:07:40.818 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:84%
geared towards
maintaining adequate salt

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.750 align:middle line:90%
levels in our body.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So if we lower our salt intake,
these compensatory hormones

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
go up to try and help us
absorb more salt from our diet.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.643 align:middle line:84%
And they constrict
the blood vessels.

00:07:52.643 --> 00:07:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So it raises blood pressure
because our fluid levels

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.180 align:middle line:84%
will go down as the body tries
to hold on to salt that it has.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So as conventional medicine
doctors, what do we do with it?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.180 align:middle line:10%
We give them anti-renin and
anti-aldosterone hormones,

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.820 align:middle line:10%
which are commonly
prescribed today

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:10%
as blood pressure medicines.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.680 align:middle line:10%
So for many blood pressure
patients, I put them on salt

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:10%
and see their blood
pressure come down.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
And they're able to come
off their ACE inhibitors

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and aldosterone drugs
that they're taking.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Have you seen
changes in hormone levels

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.610 align:middle line:84%
with unrefined versus
refined salt intake?

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Absolutely.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So unrefined salt supplies all
those minerals for the body.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:90%
It makes the body healthier.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
Refined salt just has
sodium and chloride.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.788 align:middle line:84%
It drops the pH, makes
the body more acidic.

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:36.330 align:middle line:84%
That stresses the body, and you
get all these stress hormones

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:90%
being produced.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.907 align:middle line:84%
And we don't like
to be in stress

00:08:38.907 --> 00:08:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and have stress hormones
because it gives us

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.690 align:middle line:90%
anxiety and fatigue.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big difference
between unrefined

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.460 align:middle line:90%
and refined salt hormonally.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What are the
benefits of magnesium

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.690 align:middle line:90%
in unrefined salts?

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
magnesium is a mineral

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:90%
that we need huge amounts of.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.850 align:middle line:84%
We don't have
stores of magnesium.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
So we need to get it
in on a daily basis

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to maintain optimal
magnesium levels.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Magnesium's used in hundreds
of different reactions

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
in the body, including making
our energy source, ATP.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So magnesium is one of the
constituents in unrefined salt.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not in refined salt. I
check red blood cell magnesium

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.510 align:middle line:84%
levels in every
patient that I see.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And I find magnesium levels low
in a large amount of people,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.750 align:middle line:90%
about 50% of people out there.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways you can get
it in is using unrefined salt.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a good source and an
absorbable source of magnesium.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.570 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So how
much unrefined salt

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
should someone consume
on a regular basis,

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:90%
on a daily basis?

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.693 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Assuming
someone doesn't

00:09:38.693 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:84%
have kidney failure or severe
congestive heart failure,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.670 align:middle line:84%
most people need at least a
teaspoon of unrefined salt

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.560 align:middle line:90%
beyond what's already in food.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:10%
If you sweat a lot,
if you work out

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.050 align:middle line:10%
a lot, if you're highly
active, if you're

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:10%
a nervous, busy person, they
generally will need more salt.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:10%
So somewhere between a
teaspoon and two teaspoons

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.672 align:middle line:10%
for most people is enough.

00:09:58.672 --> 00:10:00.130 align:middle line:84%
If they really work
out a lot, they

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:84%
might need three,
four teaspoons a day.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.112 align:middle line:84%
But one of the markers
that people can go by

00:10:05.112 --> 00:10:07.570 align:middle line:84%
is if you're getting leg and
foot cramps or cramps anywhere

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:84%
else in the body,
you need more salt

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.752 align:middle line:90%
until those cramps go away.

00:10:11.752 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: If they're
taking iodine,

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.068 align:middle line:84%
should they take that
same amount of salt?

00:10:16.068 --> 00:10:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So iodine,
as we talked about

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:84%
in the other episodes,
can cause the body

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:84%
to release these toxic
halites that are so

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:90%
ubiquitous in our environment.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The halite family consists
of iodine, fluoride, bromide,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:90%
and chloride.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:90%
Now chloride is part of salt.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
In the early 20th
century, there was

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
a lot of medicines
that had bromide in it,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.842 align:middle line:84%
such as Bromo-Seltzer, and
there were many others.

00:10:38.842 --> 00:10:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Today, there's
still some medicines

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
that have bromide in it, such
as antidepressant medications.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.122 align:middle line:84%
And we can still see
bromide toxicity today.

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:48.580 align:middle line:84%
But in the old days when there
was more bromide being used,

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.680 align:middle line:90%
people would get bromide toxic.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So one of the ways
conventional medicine helped

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.688 align:middle line:84%
the body get rid of bromide
when these people would show up

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:84%
in emergency rooms
with hallucinations

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.630 align:middle line:84%
and mental distress is they
would salt the bromide out.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They would give them
IVs of salt water.

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's called salting
the bromide out.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.822 align:middle line:84%
So when I put
patients on iodine,

00:11:07.822 --> 00:11:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I know they're going to
release bromide and fluoride,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.900 align:middle line:84%
and they have to get
it out of their body.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.567 align:middle line:84%
So they don't get sick releasing
those larger amounts of bromide

00:11:14.567 --> 00:11:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and fluoride, I have them
use salt, about a teaspoon

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:90%
or two a day with it.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
If somebody reacts to iodine
from taking it as a supplement

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%
and they get--

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.020 align:middle line:84%
such as a detox reaction,
they don't feel good with it,

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I always tell them stop
the iodine for a week.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.530 align:middle line:84%
Take two teaspoons
of salt a day.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you have
good hydration.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
You drink half your body
weight in water in ounces.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And then try the
iodine a week later.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.268 align:middle line:84%
The vast majority can take it
without problems at that point.

00:11:39.268 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if someone was
taking iodine and unrefined

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.840 align:middle line:84%
salt, would you recommend
they put the unrefined salt

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:90%
on their food?

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Or should they take
it with the iodine?

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: A teaspoon of
unrefined salt on your food

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.120 align:middle line:90%
is going to be a little much.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.620 align:middle line:84%
So what I tell people to do, I
don't care how you get it in.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.467 align:middle line:90%
You can eat it.

00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
Put it on your food.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:90%
You can put it in your water.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.220 align:middle line:90%
I put it in my water bottles.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't taste it.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It's an acquired taste,
takes a couple of days

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.050 align:middle line:90%
to get used to it.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.260 align:middle line:90%
Then you don't taste it.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.837 align:middle line:84%
But however they
want to get it in.

00:12:04.837 --> 00:12:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They don't necessarily have to
take it the same time as iodine

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.880 align:middle line:84%
during the day, but the
same time period, they

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
should be taking
salt with iodine.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: It almost
sounds like Big Pharma

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
and the conventional
medicine conglomerate

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.120 align:middle line:84%
has purposely instigated
this whole salt dilemma.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
It almost reminds me
of if you have a fever,

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.160 align:middle line:84%
take something to
reduce your fever

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:84%
and not let your body naturally
take care of whatever it

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.787 align:middle line:90%
needs to take care of.

00:12:31.787 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you think
there's some sort

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
of conspiratorial
thing going on here?

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, think about it.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking
in unrefined salt

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
or now they're saying everybody
needs to be on a low salt diet,

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that would contribute
to or could contribute

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.300 align:middle line:84%
to a lot of the
chronic illnesses

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.010 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of the
degenerative diseases

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:53.020 align:middle line:84%
that we may be
suffering from today.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.087 align:middle line:90%
And people believe it.

00:12:55.087 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I don't
think most doctors are

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.212 align:middle line:90%
part of that conspiracy theory.

00:12:58.212 --> 00:13:00.040 align:middle line:84%
I think most doctors
don't know about salt,

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and they remember
what we learned

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:03.130 align:middle line:84%
in medical school,
which was probably

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
about one minute on salt,
that a low salt diet's better

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and salt causes blood
pressure problems.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.230 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, I don't think
there's a conspiracy theory.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.420 align:middle line:84%
I think there's more
ignorance in that sense.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.338 align:middle line:84%
But I think if
doctors can learn--

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:18.130 align:middle line:84%
look at physiology and
look at biochemistry

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.920 align:middle line:84%
and go back and look at
the biochemical pathways

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.340 align:middle line:84%
and think about what a low salt
diet will do to the hormone

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.675 align:middle line:84%
production from the
kidneys and the adrenals,

00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
they'll come to the
realization that we

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:90%
don't need a low salt diet.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just going to raise
blood pressure and cause

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.350 align:middle line:84%
doctors to start prescribing
angiotensin-converting enzyme

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
ACE inhibitors and
anti-aldosterone medications

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and anti-renin medications,
which are the most common blood

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.492 align:middle line:84%
pressure medications
being prescribed today.

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So what is the best
type of unrefined salt people

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:90%
can get?

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.610 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So I've tested
Celtic's brand sea salt

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
from Selina's, I've tested
Redmond's real salt,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and I've tested Himalayan
salt four times each.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:84%
They've all tested
clean from toxins.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.480 align:middle line:84%
They've all had good
mineral content.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So I tell patients, whatever
tastes better on your food,

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
you could use that
type of salt for it.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.668 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: You
mentioned water intake.

00:14:08.668 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really big
about water intake

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
because most people don't
even drink water anymore.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:90%
They're drinking coffee.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.070 align:middle line:90%
They're drinking tea.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:90%
They're drinking energy drinks.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And some people even
say, I don't drink water

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.410 align:middle line:90%
because it doesn't taste good.

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:84%
So how does that come into play
when you're putting somebody

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
on unrefined salt?

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And couldn't unrefined salt
actually help with dehydration?

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So our
body's 70% water.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Our brain is 80% water.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.140 align:middle line:84%
If we don't take in
adequate amounts of water,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:37.280 align:middle line:90%
we're not camels.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:90%
We don't store water.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.940 align:middle line:90%
We'll be dehydrated.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
people generally

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.535 align:middle line:90%
don't take in enough water.

00:14:42.535 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:90%
They're drinking other things.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
They're drinking juice
with too much sugar in it,

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.790 align:middle line:84%
which acts as a diuretic
and pulls water out of you.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
They're drinking now
these large coffees.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And a cup of coffee
today is much different

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:84%
than a cup of coffee
10, 15 years ago was.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.292 align:middle line:90%
It's much larger in size.

00:14:59.292 --> 00:15:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So the caffeine can
pull water out of you

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.480 align:middle line:90%
and make you dehydrated.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And the coffee can
be worsened if you're

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.903 align:middle line:84%
putting a lot of sugar in it
and further dehydrating things.

00:15:07.903 --> 00:15:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So I do think people are
more dehydrated today

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.840 align:middle line:90%
than they were in the past.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
first things I ask

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
my patients in the
initial history

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.443 align:middle line:90%
is, how much water do you drink?

00:15:16.443 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And I ask, what
else do you drink?

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And I go through
the list of coffee,

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:23.080 align:middle line:84%
soda, tea and what they're
putting in these things.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage them to
take their weight in pounds,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.360 align:middle line:84%
divide by two, and drink that
many ounces of water a day

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:90%
as a minimum.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Again, if they're
exercising or they're busy,

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.240 align:middle line:90%
they'll need more water.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Now salt and water
go hand in hand

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
here because the body
can't hold on to the water

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
if there's not enough
salt. It's all the water.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And so you definitely need
salt to hold that water in.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And they definitely
need enough water

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:90%
just to hydrate their body.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.790 align:middle line:90%
So I call this the basics.

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.353 align:middle line:84%
This is just doing the basics
with people is water and salt.

00:15:51.353 --> 00:15:53.020 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: I mean, if
you think about it,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:57.250 align:middle line:84%
salt is like one of the
most inexpensive treatment

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.680 align:middle line:90%
modalities out there.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Unrefined salt
doesn't cost much money either.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's so much
healthier for the body.

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.495 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very cheap
good thing to have.

00:16:07.495 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Have you seen
prescription medications

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that people are taking
interact with the salt

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
balance within the system?

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.168 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, the
problem is the blood pressure

00:16:16.168 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:90%
medicines, the diuretics.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And they cause the body
to release minerals,

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:84%
and they release salt.
And that's how they work.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So they deplete
the body of salt.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
And it does lower the blood
pressure because everything

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.310 align:middle line:90%
lowers down with that.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:32.808 align:middle line:84%
But it's just blocking
the hormonal releases.

00:16:32.808 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not the right
thing to do with people.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Many times they need
salt unless they

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.190 align:middle line:84%
have severe congestive heart
failure or renal failure,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:90%
kidney failure.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Have you
had a dramatic case

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.710 align:middle line:84%
that you could talk
about briefly of somebody

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.487 align:middle line:84%
who was very salt deficient and
then completely changed around?

00:16:48.487 --> 00:16:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you do a
holistic approach as well.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.465 align:middle line:84%
But something you can
pinpoint it was the salt.

00:16:53.465 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So I
have a patient, Bob,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.370 align:middle line:90%
who's 89 years old.

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:90%
This man is in great shape.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
He works out like a fiend.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
He's built. And
I always tell him

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
he looks like he's 30 to 40
years younger than his age.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.599 align:middle line:84%
And he came to see me
last week with anxiety.

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.359 align:middle line:84%
And his daughter was
with him, and she said,

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:16.359 align:middle line:84%
well, we took him to the
urgent care last night,

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.859 align:middle line:84%
and they told him
nothing was wrong.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:19.359 align:middle line:84%
I said, did they
draw blood work?

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:21.970 align:middle line:90%
So she's fishing in her purse.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.430 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, have
you been taking your salt?

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.410 align:middle line:10%
He goes, you know, I forgot
that the last two weeks.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:10%
So she fishes out the lab slip,
and his sodium level was 129.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that's below the
reference range for sodium.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.610 align:middle line:84%
That's a really
dangerous level of salt.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.478 align:middle line:84%
And if it drops much lower than
that, you can get seizures.

00:17:39.478 --> 00:17:41.020 align:middle line:84%
You can get arrhythmias
of the heart.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:90%
You can die from it.

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Now his level was
up much higher that.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.950 align:middle line:84%
It was 141 about a
month before that.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a perfect
example of older people.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:84%
They can drop their salt
and water levels really

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.460 align:middle line:90%
fast when they change things up.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.130 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at that, and I said
to him, you're salt deficient.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I think that's creating all
this hormonal response to it

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:90%
and giving you the anxiety.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, let's give you a
hydration IV with salt water.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
You start upping
your salt. I'd like

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
you to take a tablespoon of salt
a day for the next few days,

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.850 align:middle line:90%
because he drank a lot of water.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And call me tomorrow and let
me know how you're doing.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I called him when I got
to work the next morning.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.373 align:middle line:84%
He said after the IV,
he felt much better,

00:18:20.373 --> 00:18:21.790 align:middle line:84%
took that salt
throughout the day.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.440 align:middle line:90%
All the anxiety was gone.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And his plan for me was just to
take more salt in-- that's all

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.090 align:middle line:90%
I told him to do--

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:29.410 align:middle line:90%
and to maintain it.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What is your opinion
on salt in the adrenal glands?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.335 align:middle line:84%
And does that affect the
amount of cortisol production?

00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:37.372 align:middle line:84%
How does that affect
the adrenal glands?

00:18:37.372 --> 00:18:38.830 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So
the adrenal glands

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
release hormones to control
our salt intake in the body.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:84%
Conversely, salt helps--
adequate amounts of salt

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.890 align:middle line:84%
will settle down
adrenal hyperactivity.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:84%
So there's no
question when people

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.175 align:middle line:84%
get in a nervous,
anxious state, it's

00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:53.300 align:middle line:90%
called a sympathetic state.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.575 align:middle line:84%
The adrenal glands are releasing
cortisol and epinephrine

00:18:56.575 --> 00:18:58.520 align:middle line:90%
to help us through the state.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.243 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fight
or flight syndrome.

00:19:00.243 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say take that
salt because it sometimes

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
can settle it down.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
But better yet, maintain optimal
salt levels all the time.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And many times you won't end
up into that fight or flight

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:90%
state.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And when you do, it
won't be quite as bad,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.923 align:middle line:84%
and you just take a
little bit of salt

00:19:13.923 --> 00:19:15.542 align:middle line:90%
to pull yourself out of it.

00:19:15.542 --> 00:19:17.500 align:middle line:84%
I've seen that occur many
times in my patients.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, how often
do you see adrenal burnout

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.783 align:middle line:90%
or adrenal exhaustion?

00:19:21.783 --> 00:19:23.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
unfortunately,

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
in our busy, stressful
world, a lot of times.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
And I always-- first thing I
go to with adrenal problems

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.323 align:middle line:84%
is salt and make sure they
have adequate amounts of salt

00:19:31.323 --> 00:19:33.365 align:middle line:84%
because that takes the
pressure off the adrenals.

00:19:33.365 --> 00:19:35.440 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
release so many hormones,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.970 align:middle line:90%
and they can settle down.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.157 align:middle line:90%
They have time to heal.

00:19:38.157 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: So when the adrenals--

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:84%
when you start seeing
adrenal burnout

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.380 align:middle line:84%
symptoms or adrenal
exhaustion, how

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.640 align:middle line:84%
does that affect the hormone
production in the body?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.880 align:middle line:84%
Pregnenolone, estrogen,
and progesterone.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well,
what happens is the--

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.160 align:middle line:84%
so pregnenolone and DHEA
are adrenal hormones.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.800 align:middle line:90%
And these help build tissue up.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.395 align:middle line:84%
And cortisol and
epinephrine help to--

00:20:02.395 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:90%
they're catabolic hormones.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.103 align:middle line:90%
They help to break tissue down.

00:20:05.103 --> 00:20:07.270 align:middle line:84%
What happens when we're in
a chronic stressful state

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
is we just get these stressful
hormones being released,

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.007 align:middle line:84%
and tissue gets broken
down much faster.

00:20:12.007 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And we get an under production
of the hormones that help build

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:90%
things back up in the body.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:84%
So we want to restore that
balance of getting the adrenals

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:90%
settled down.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's no conventional
medicine that'll do that.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.702 align:middle line:84%
It's usually-- it's only natural
therapies that'll do that.

00:20:26.702 --> 00:20:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's doing the basics at
first-- drinking enough water,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
getting in enough salt, getting
the hormonal system rebalanced,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.240 align:middle line:90%
correcting nutrient imbalances.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin C is really
important here.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
The highest concentration
of vitamin C

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.850 align:middle line:90%
is in the adrenal glands.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And we can't
manufacture vitamin C.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.760 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the enzyme to
convert glucose into vitamin C.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
So we have to take it through
our food or supplement with it.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Our vitamin C levels in our food
have gone down over the years.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.470 align:middle line:90%
So it's tough.

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And vitamin C is used up
in detoxification reactions

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.920 align:middle line:10%
So I think people need to
supplement with vitamin C

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:10%
all times.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.280 align:middle line:10%
Around 3,000 to 5,000
milligrams a day

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.980 align:middle line:10%
is enough to saturate the
red and white blood cells.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.420 align:middle line:10%
And the only side effects
with vitamin C is diarrhea.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.580 align:middle line:84%
So if they get that, they
just lower the dose down.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.622 align:middle line:84%
But I think vitamin C is
a really important thing

00:21:15.622 --> 00:21:18.650 align:middle line:84%
for adrenal stabilization,
just as salt and water is

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:19.820 align:middle line:90%
part of that, too.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.362 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Have you
seen somebody that

00:21:21.362 --> 00:21:24.380 align:middle line:84%
might have been salt
deficient and you give them

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:25.610 align:middle line:90%
the unrefined salt?

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And let's say it balanced the
adrenals out for high blood

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.000 align:middle line:90%
pressure.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
there's a correlation

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.073 align:middle line:84%
between the adrenals
and high blood pressure.

00:21:36.073 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So when the
adrenals get stressed out,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:90%
they release these hormones--

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.960 align:middle line:84%
cortisol epinephrine
and things--

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.320 align:middle line:84%
and other hormones that cause
the blood pressure to go up.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
And you can give them
anti-hypertensive medications

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.610 align:middle line:90%
that lower the blood pressure.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.620 align:middle line:84%
But you're not treating
the underlying cause.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.380 align:middle line:84%
The underlying cause is
adrenal hyperactivity.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
treated many times

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:02.090 align:middle line:84%
with helping people slow their
lives down, meditate, exercise,

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:06.508 align:middle line:84%
drinking water, salt, vitamin C,
a holistic approach to things.

00:22:06.508 --> 00:22:08.300 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So for
treatment of the adrenals,

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.150 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned vitamin
C, mentioned iodine,

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:15.687 align:middle line:84%
of course, multiple times,
water, salt. Anything else

00:22:15.687 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
that you would add
into that treatment

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.805 align:middle line:90%
program for the adrenals?

00:22:18.805 --> 00:22:20.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: So it depends
on what the problem is.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
But I find adrenal
glandulars very

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.570 align:middle line:90%
helpful from neonatal cows.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
That's an old time
remedy that doctors

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.440 align:middle line:84%
used to use when there
was a glandular problem.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.170 align:middle line:84%
They would use a
neonatal glandular.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And I use neonatal glandular
or neonatal adrenal glandulars

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
for my patients.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.870 align:middle line:84%
There's other supplements
that can be used for adrenals.

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:84%
But generally, if
they do the basics,

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.490 align:middle line:84%
they don't need a
lot of supplements.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.440 align:middle line:84%
The body's designed
to heal itself,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
and the body's designed
to function optimally

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.658 align:middle line:84%
if it has the optimal raw
materials that it needs.

00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:54.200 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: That was
a great statement.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.520 align:middle line:90%
The body is designed.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:84%
We have a self-healing
mechanism.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:90%
We are designed to heal itself.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.480 align:middle line:84%
It's just that-- not
addressing the symptoms

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.747 align:middle line:90%
but addressing the root cause.

00:23:03.747 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: We're not
designed to be sick.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not designed
to be fatigued.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
We're not designed to
be anxious all the time.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.632 align:middle line:84%
We're designed to be healthy
at all stages of life.

00:23:11.632 --> 00:23:13.340 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Talk about
salt in the thyroid.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.867 align:middle line:84%
How does salt work
with the thyroid?

00:23:15.867 --> 00:23:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, it works
through the adrenal glands.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And the adrenal
glands and the thyroid

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
work together to maintain
optimal energy and balance.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And people can get problems
with the thyroid glands

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
from the adrenals, and
they can get problems

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.240 align:middle line:84%
from their adrenals
from the thyroid gland.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes that's
hard to figure out.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.290 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know which
is causing the problem.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's where I come into
play to try and figure it out.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to treat a
patient with adrenal problems

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
with thyroid hormone
because that can make

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.390 align:middle line:90%
that adrenal problem worse.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to help them fix the
adrenal problem first, then

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:90%
treat them with thyroid hormone.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's where a
good holistic doctor

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:90%
can work with the patient.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Does salt detoxify
anything else from the body?

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you talked about
it helping detox bromine

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:90%
and fluoride.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Anything else that
you've noticed?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:03.920 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Yes.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.830 align:middle line:84%
The detoxification
pathways are really

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:08.360 align:middle line:84%
tied to enough
sodium in the body

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.120 align:middle line:84%
because they're
all run by sodium.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's not only the
bromide and fluoride.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Salt, you need the sodium atom
to get iodine into the cells

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and to get iodine to
work for detoxification.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.380 align:middle line:84%
All this stuff is
intertwined with one another.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:84%
We need optimal levels of
all the essential elements

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.050 align:middle line:84%
in the body, and
salt is one of them.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:31.660 align:middle line:90%
Iodine's another one.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.690 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What you
think about salt baths?

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: I have patients
use salt baths all the time

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:40.160 align:middle line:84%
for detoxification, for
muscle aches and pains.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a gentle way to help
detox and help pull things out

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.505 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: And what kind of salt
do you recommend for the baths?

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:49.880 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Epsom salts,
the old tried and true remedy,

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.680 align:middle line:90%
work.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.390 align:middle line:84%
And they work great
for wounds, to help

00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:90%
to pull debris out of wounds.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I have my patients use a
lot of Epsom salts, which

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.538 align:middle line:84%
is very high in magnesium,
very high in sulfur.

00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: So if I'm
watching the show

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.890 align:middle line:84%
and I want to know if I
have a salt deficiency, what

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.550 align:middle line:84%
would be some of the signs
that I might be able to notice

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:14.120 align:middle line:84%
like runny nose or
anything that I might

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.890 align:middle line:84%
be suffering from that may
indicate that I have a salt

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:17.780 align:middle line:90%
deficiency?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, the key sign
that you have a salt deficiency

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.648 align:middle line:84%
is if you get a leg
cramp or a foot cramp

00:25:21.648 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:90%
or a cramp anywhere in the body.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.640 align:middle line:84%
You are salt efficient
till proven otherwise,

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and you need more
salt in the body.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.300 align:middle line:84%
Another sign is if
you're dehydrated.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.425 align:middle line:84%
Now sometimes people don't
know they're dehydrated.

00:25:31.425 --> 00:25:35.210 align:middle line:84%
But if your skin is sunken
in, your tongue's dry,

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
you have ridges on your nails,
that's chronic dehydration.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.245 align:middle line:90%
You need salt and water.

00:25:40.245 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You need the salt to
hold the water in,

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.080 align:middle line:84%
but you need more water to
correct that dehydrated state.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Let's move on.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.620 align:middle line:84%
I know you also
use ozone therapy

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
as part of your holistic
treatment approach,

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.840 align:middle line:84%
maybe not in all patients
but maybe in some.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And people hear all the time,
oh, ozone is bad for you.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Ozone, the ozone layer,
we have ozone in the air

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:04.400 align:middle line:84%
that you're breathing today or
a high ozone alert sometimes.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
What is the benefit of using
ozone in a holistic practice?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, ozone is O3.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:84%
We can contrast
that with O2, oxygen

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.740 align:middle line:90%
that we're breathing right now.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:84%
O3 is when three oxygen
atoms combine to form ozone.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:24.560 align:middle line:84%
O2 is oxygen as we refer to it
that we're breathing right now.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Ozone is formed in
the atmosphere when

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.410 align:middle line:84%
lightning and electrical
discharge comes across the sky

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and combines three oxygen
atoms together into O3.

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So after lightning and
a thunderstorm hits,

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.720 align:middle line:84%
we get that smell in the
air, that clean smell.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.310 align:middle line:90%
That's an ozone smell.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So the best medical
device to detect

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.760 align:middle line:84%
whether ozone's
being made or not

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:90%
is right here on our bodies.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the human nose.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:53.150 align:middle line:84%
So ozone was first
discovered in the 1800s when

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:57.118 align:middle line:84%
a doctor was running electrical
discharge over some water,

00:26:57.118 --> 00:26:58.160 align:middle line:90%
and he smelled something.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And he described
what he smelled.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.363 align:middle line:84%
And they figured out
a few years later

00:27:01.363 --> 00:27:03.080 align:middle line:84%
that was ozone is
what he was smelling.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.380 align:middle line:84%
So you can have
ozone manufactured

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.570 align:middle line:84%
by running electrical
discharge over an oxygen flow.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:11.630 align:middle line:10%
So for doctors to
use ozone, they're

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.250 align:middle line:10%
going to have an oxygen tank.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:16.010 align:middle line:10%
It can be hooked up to
a little machine where

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.860 align:middle line:10%
electrical discharge is
run across the oxygen

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:10%
as it's flowing through a tube.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And what comes on the other
side of that is ozone.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And ozone has been used
in medicine for close

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:27.170 align:middle line:90%
to a hundred years.

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.638 align:middle line:10%
And it was used in the United
States a hundred years ago.

00:27:30.638 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And then when the
Flexner report came out--

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.680 align:middle line:90%
I think it was in 1930s--

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.510 align:middle line:84%
where the AMA was saying, we're
going to allow these therapies

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.802 align:middle line:84%
and we're not going to allow
these therapies to be done

00:27:39.802 --> 00:27:42.278 align:middle line:84%
in the US, ozone was
specifically singled out

00:27:42.278 --> 00:27:44.570 align:middle line:84%
as a therapy not to allow,
even though there was really

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:45.370 align:middle line:90%
no reason for that.

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.752 align:middle line:90%
It was a safe therapy.

00:27:46.752 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:90%
Doctors were using it wildly.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:84%
There were no reports
of problems with it.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.960 align:middle line:84%
Now the United States is
decades behind other countries

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:90%
who have been using ozone.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Cuba uses it as their main
therapy for almost anything

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.720 align:middle line:90%
because it's cheap.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.553 align:middle line:84%
They don't have enough
money to put everyone

00:28:01.553 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:90%
on antibiotics who get sick.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So they use ozone to treat
a lot of their infections.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:84%
There's no bacteria,
virus, parasite, fungi

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:90%
that's resistant to ozone.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Ozone can be used
for infections.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.100 align:middle line:84%
When you put ozone
in the human body,

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.580 align:middle line:84%
it converts into O2 or
oxygen very quickly.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's a good way
to oxygenate tissues.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.430 align:middle line:84%
We know cancer cells don't
like oxygen environments.

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.927 align:middle line:84%
They like to live in a
non-oxygen environment.

00:28:24.927 --> 00:28:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you can get ozone
around cancer cells,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.360 align:middle line:84%
that's one way as an
anti-cancer therapy.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we use ozone for
hundreds of things in the body.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.040 align:middle line:90%
It creates stem cell production.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.455 align:middle line:90%
It stimulates repair cells.

00:28:38.455 --> 00:28:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It helps people produce energy.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.880 align:middle line:84%
We think the human body
might produce ozone.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.603 align:middle line:90%
We're not quite sure of that.

00:28:44.603 --> 00:28:46.270 align:middle line:84%
But ozone also
stimulates the production

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.330 align:middle line:84%
of hydrogen peroxide
in the body, which

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:50.830 align:middle line:84%
we know every white blood cell
releases when it's in contact

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.340 align:middle line:90%
with a foreign invader.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So you can enhance that whole
process with using ozone.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.550 align:middle line:84%
There are so many uses
of ozone in medicine

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.790 align:middle line:84%
that I ended up writing a
book on that called "Ozone--

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.440 align:middle line:90%
The Miracle Therapy."

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: How is
ozone administered?

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:84%
What are the different ways to
administer ozone to somebody?

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, you can
administer ozone topically

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.690 align:middle line:10%
and put it on as oils on the
skin, ozonated olive oil.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.060 align:middle line:10%
You can administer ozone
through the ears, where

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.883 align:middle line:10%
we put a stethoscope
on a patient

00:29:17.883 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:10%
and hook the other end up
to an ozone machine, which

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:10%
blows the gas through the ears.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.820 align:middle line:84%
You can administer ozone with
injections into the body.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.560 align:middle line:90%
You can do it IV.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:27.557 align:middle line:90%
There are a bunch of--

00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:28.390 align:middle line:90%
you can it rectally.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.770 align:middle line:90%
You can do it vaginally.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:84%
Many ways to get
ozone into the body.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
We use it as a good helpful
therapy in our office.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.130 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yeah.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:84%
Besides ozone, what are some
of the other favorite things

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.660 align:middle line:90%
that you use for the body?

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.570 align:middle line:84%
How do you determine
or how do you

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.820 align:middle line:84%
create that holistic
treatment plan

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.987 align:middle line:90%
for each individual patient?

00:29:46.987 --> 00:29:49.403 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Well, I create
it by starting off doing what

00:29:49.403 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:90%
I was taught in medical school.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's taking a history, listening
to patients, asking questions,

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.027 align:middle line:84%
trying to get an idea
of where things are,

00:29:58.027 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:84%
how they're functioning
and what's happening

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:90%
and what their story is.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Then doing a physical exam and
seeing what I see on the body

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and confirming or denying
what I think is going on.

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Then ordering
laboratory tests to,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:84%
again, help me make
a firm diagnosis

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.680 align:middle line:84%
or point me in a
different direction.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And then trying to put the
whole picture together.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.113 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think that I'm--

00:30:19.113 --> 00:30:20.530 align:middle line:84%
as we said before
in another show,

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:21.988 align:middle line:84%
I'm not treating
a laboratory test.

00:30:21.988 --> 00:30:23.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm treating patients here.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
So once you do that, then
you can try and figure out,

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
what does the body
need to right itself?

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:33.580 align:middle line:84%
The human body was well designed
to function optimally even

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.660 align:middle line:90%
into old age.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I think if we can help it get
rid of toxins that are in it,

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.067 align:middle line:84%
help it supply the nutrients
that are deficient, and maybe

00:30:41.067 --> 00:30:43.150 align:middle line:84%
give it a little boost
occasionally with something

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
like ozone or B12 shots, that
people can really function well

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.510 align:middle line:90%
and get their health back.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:53.080 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: What have you
seen and how have you

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:84%
seen patients transform
when you start

00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:00.400 align:middle line:84%
working on healing their
gut and then also healing

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.150 align:middle line:84%
their liver in conjunction
with the thyroid

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.695 align:middle line:90%
in your holistic health program?

00:31:05.695 --> 00:31:07.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN:
There's no question

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.765 align:middle line:84%
people are not
going to be healthy

00:31:08.765 --> 00:31:09.890 align:middle line:90%
if their gut's not healthy.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.900 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be healthy
if their thyroid's not healthy

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:90%
and their liver's not healthy.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:18.257 align:middle line:90%
So again, doing the basics--

00:31:18.257 --> 00:31:20.840 align:middle line:84%
taking history, doing a physical
exam, ordering the lab tests,

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.150 align:middle line:84%
putting it all together,
having them eat better,

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.620 align:middle line:90%
having them drink water.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:27.260 align:middle line:84%
Oxy-Powder's been a great help
for patients for constipation.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.500 align:middle line:90%
My mother's on it, by the way.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.010 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't
stand alone, and it

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.320 align:middle line:84%
should be used as part of a
holistic treatment regimen.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't stand
for doing the basics.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.330 align:middle line:84%
The basics are drinking
water, eating a clean diet,

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.400 align:middle line:84%
getting enough salt
in, and taking iodine.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.860 align:middle line:84%
I think those are really the
basic things people can do.

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's
definitely-- people need

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.000 align:middle line:84%
to detox and need to clean out
things every once in a while

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and especially in
our world we live in.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And some people have
overgrowth of bad gut bacteria

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and bad yeast
overgrowths and things

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.400 align:middle line:84%
like that that you can help
rebalance to a better health.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And then if they eat a good
diet and through the water

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.720 align:middle line:84%
and the salt and the
iodine and so on,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.273 align:middle line:84%
they can maintain
it at that point.

00:32:10.273 --> 00:32:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what a
holistic treatment regimen

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.597 align:middle line:90%
should provide for people.

00:32:13.597 --> 00:32:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, I totally agree.

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.970 align:middle line:90%
It's that full body approach.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.570 align:middle line:84%
How many people do you think
have sensitivity to gluten?

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BROWNSTEIN: Oh, it's huge.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge amount.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.020 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
that at breakfast today.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I would say the number one
sensitivity out there is dairy,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.590 align:middle line:90%
and number two is gluten.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And I would estimate over
80% for both of them.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.830 align:middle line:84%
But dairy seems to trump
gluten as a bigger problem.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's the way
we're handling these foods.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.170 align:middle line:84%
There's something wrong because
we didn't have all this problem

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.280 align:middle line:90%
50 years ago.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.540 align:middle line:90%
This problem is now.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So either there's something
wrong with the plants

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.640 align:middle line:84%
as regard to gluten
or perhaps it's

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.230 align:middle line:84%
the glyphosate or
the Roundup they're

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:84%
putting on the plants that's
somehow reacting to us

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.790 align:middle line:90%
and causing us gluten problems.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Or it's the
genetically bred plants

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.360 align:middle line:84%
that produce more
gluten that has just

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.010 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmed our system.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.320 align:middle line:84%
In regards to
cow's milk, I think

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.120 align:middle line:84%
it's just the super
pasteurization of milk

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.340 align:middle line:84%
has totally changed
the protein structure,

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.350 align:middle line:90%
and our bodies can't handle it.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.300 align:middle line:84%
And I check antibody levels for
these on every new patient that

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.100 align:middle line:90%
comes in.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.413 align:middle line:84%
I'm amazed at how many people
have sensitivities to these.

00:33:17.413 --> 00:33:18.830 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the
most common things

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.270 align:middle line:84%
I do is tell people to
avoid gluten and dairy.

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.365 align:middle line:84%
And they really
need to avoid it.

00:33:23.365 --> 00:33:24.990 align:middle line:84%
They're producing
too much inflammation

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.110 align:middle line:90%
when they eat that stuff.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.980 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Yeah, there's
blood in dairy products.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.050 align:middle line:90%
There's vaccine residue.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.480 align:middle line:84%
There's antibiotic
residue in milk.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And then what are
the cows eating?

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.360 align:middle line:84%
They're eating
genetically modified food.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.930 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, if you take all of
that and you put it in the cow,

00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:41.760 align:middle line:84%
what do you expect going
to come out of the cow?

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.520 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's just--

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>BROWNSTEIN: And the
cows are stressed out,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and the cows have a
lot of stress hormones.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.220 align:middle line:90%
That's ending up in the milk.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:90%
And the milk is dirty.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why they have to super
pasteurized it because they're

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.560 align:middle line:90%
not processing it correctly.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.140 align:middle line:84%
They used to process that
milk with iodine right

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.220 align:middle line:90%
from the start.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And the government has
lowered the amount of iodine

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.650 align:middle line:84%
they can put in the milk, and
now it's all contaminated.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.195 align:middle line:84%
So they have to
superheat it, which

00:34:03.195 --> 00:34:05.070 align:middle line:84%
changes the protein
structure, which makes it

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:90%
a bad substance for our bodies.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.889 align:middle line:84%
So it's just-- we have
a big mess on our hands.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to the point of
eating organically, supporting

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:18.150 align:middle line:84%
organic farmers, eating
food without pesticides,

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:84%
shop appropriately, and
use our dollars wisely

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.540 align:middle line:84%
so we can make a
change with things.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.380 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: One more time I'd
like to mention your book.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brownstein's book,
"Salt Your Way to Health."

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.719 align:middle line:84%
Highly recommend you
go get this book.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brownstein, what can other
people do to find out more,

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.810 align:middle line:90%
read more of your information?

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Where can they go to study
more of your research?

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:47.550 align:middle line:10%
>>BROWNSTEIN: They can go to my
website, www.drbrownstein.com.

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:49.449 align:middle line:10%
I have 15 books there.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.020 align:middle line:10%
And all I write
about is what works.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:10%
And I see it work
in my practice,

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.030 align:middle line:10%
and I get excited about it.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:10%
And I try to educate
people so that they

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.620 align:middle line:10%
can make a better
choice and they

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.140 align:middle line:10%
can make appropriate choices.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have to be
railroaded into taking drugs

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.485 align:middle line:90%
that they don't need.

00:35:03.485 --> 00:35:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>>EDWARD: Thank you so much
for coming on the show today.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.190 align:middle line:84%
