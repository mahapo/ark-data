00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: For
millions of people,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.120 align:middle line:84%
the most terrifying
moment in their life

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.640 align:middle line:84%
is when they're given
a cancer diagnosis.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.710 align:middle line:84%
The blood drains from
your brain and the world

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.220 align:middle line:84%
becomes a haze of
fear and confusion.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.170 align:middle line:84%
This is what Dr. James Forsythe
was dealing with as one

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
of the nation's
first oncologists.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.090 align:middle line:84%
After watching the cure rate
stuck at an abysmal 2% to 3%

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.340 align:middle line:84%
among stage IV cancer
patients, Dr. Forsythe

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.800 align:middle line:84%
began looking for
answers and found them.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.865 align:middle line:84%
I spoke with him at his
offices in Reno, Nevada.

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
It's so good to
be here with you.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I've heard a lot about
you from different sources

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:84%
through the last
couple of years.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting the way
your name keeps coming up.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.410 align:middle line:10%
But one of the things--
the part of your story

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.590 align:middle line:10%
that I find so
amazing is that you've

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:10%
had to really fight for not
only your rights, but the rights

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:10%
of other doctors to
even be able to present

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:10%
the patient with options;
because when it comes

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.870 align:middle line:10%
to cancer, there don't
seem to be a lot of options

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.402 align:middle line:10%
if you're shoved down
the narrow, normal route.

00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:37.860 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe you can talk a
little bit about what happened.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 align:middle line:84%
You are an oncologist,
but talk a little bit

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
about how you came to understand
that the traditional route

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.760 align:middle line:84%
of chemotherapy and
radiation just simply

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.552 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to be
enough for your clients.

00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:49.093 align:middle line:10%
>>JAMES FORSYTHE,
M.D., H.M.D.: Well,

00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:10%
thank you, Regina, very much.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.620 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps a few words
about my background

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:10%
might be in order at this point.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:10%
I did my undergraduate
work at UC Berkeley,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:10%
so I was born a
radical, I guess.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
I followed that up with medical
school at UC San Francisco,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.400 align:middle line:84%
was there during the
Haight-Ashbury heyday

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:90%
in the Summer of Love.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Actually was a participant in
the Haight-Ashbury free clinic

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
for drugs with my
classmate, David Smith,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
who became head of addiction
medicine in the United States.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
After that, I was running out
of money in medical school,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
so I joined the army
and became commissioned

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.650 align:middle line:84%
in the army as a
second lieutenant

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:90%
during my senior year.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And then was lucky enough to
get my training and internship

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.977 align:middle line:84%
on the Presidio at
Letterman Army Hospital.

00:02:37.977 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.268 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Which was a
beautiful facility at the time.

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:43.550 align:middle line:90%
It has now been demolished.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:84%
From there, the Vietnam
war was breaking out

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and I was not real anxious
to go over to Southeast Asia.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't quite sure of
what specialty I wanted,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.800 align:middle line:84%
so I decided that pathology
would be a good choice

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:84%
because it would lend itself for
any subsequent choices I made.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So I entered a
pathology residency

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.060 align:middle line:84%
at Tripler Army Hospital,
Honolulu, Hawaii,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.090 align:middle line:84%
which was not a hardship
tour incidentally.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
But from there, became
a certified pathologist

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.230 align:middle line:84%
and then was shipped to
Fort Bragg, North Carolina,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.060 align:middle line:84%
where I was assistant chief of
pathology at the army hospital

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And for two years,
I worked there

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
doing research and teaching and
was part of the 82nd Airborne

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.240 align:middle line:90%
paratrooper unit.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
From there, I did get
orders to Vietnam.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And after arriving in Vietnam
during Tet number two in 1969,

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.750 align:middle line:84%
without having a
weapon or anything

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.720 align:middle line:84%
and having to spend the first
couple weeks in a bunker.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
We were being shelled
by mortars from outside

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
of Long Binh, which was a
few miles north of Saigon,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.446 align:middle line:84%
and finally got out all right
without having any bruises.

00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Was shipped up to my
final destination, which

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
was Chu Lai, which was in
the southern part of ICOR,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.090 align:middle line:84%
right on the South China Sea--
a beautiful, beautiful venue.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I understand there's a
Hilton Hotel there now-- where

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.000 align:middle line:84%
I became head of the
laboratory there, and then

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
another surgical
hospital, which was

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
about 15 miles
away in the jungle.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.750 align:middle line:84%
So during that time, I was
head of malaria control, blood

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
banking, tropical medicine,
forensic pathology, et cetera.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:90%
And I had some close calls.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
Went down on a
helicopter at one point

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.720 align:middle line:84%
when we were treating
refugees at an offshore island

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
and, unfortunately,
witnessed the death

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
of the only nurse that was
killed during active duty.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.140 align:middle line:84%
She was hit by a rocket
that came to our base

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
and blew up on the ward
she was working on.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And that was quite a
traumatic experience.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
After coming back
from Vietnam, I

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
decided I wasn't ready to
do pathology all my life,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:84%
I was more of a
people person; so, I

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.860 align:middle line:84%
entered an internal medicine
residency in San Francisco.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And then after completing
training there for two years,

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I went on into a
cancer fellowship.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Why did
you choose cancer?

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.533 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: You
know, I was always

00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:84%
interested in
hematology and oncology.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:90%
It was a natural bent.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.100 align:middle line:84%
The doctors in San Francisco
that I admired the most

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.000 align:middle line:84%
were in that specialty, and
it was just interesting.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.770 align:middle line:84%
I felt it was going to be
widening and broadening

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the word
oncology was foreign to me

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.952 align:middle line:84%
when I actually entered the
subspecialty because we really

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:52.410 align:middle line:84%
didn't hear about
it in med school.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
There were hardly any
chemotherapy drugs

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.250 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't even give
boards in oncology at that time.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:90%
So, it was very new.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And I had people in my class
in the fellowship program that

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
later on became the
rock stars of oncology

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
basically, in leadership around
the country in major programs,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and responsible for many of the
newer developments in oncology.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.500 align:middle line:84%
So I was in a very elite class,
and I completed my training

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.880 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And then decided to go into
practice in San Francisco

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:84%
with a small group
of oncologists,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:90%
which I did for several years.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And during that period of
time, I was working downtown

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and the AIDS epidemic
started breaking out,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
but we weren't really aware
that it was AIDS at the time.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And we were seeing young
men die of strange diseases

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.850 align:middle line:84%
that we absolutely knew
nothing about what caused it.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
There weren't the tests
available at that time to know

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.870 align:middle line:84%
how to test the immune system,
they just weren't available.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So we were always guessing as
to what was going on and almost

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.532 align:middle line:84%
always wrong because we
never could put it together.

00:07:08.532 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't until the
early '80s, as you know,

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.155 align:middle line:84%
that the HIV epidemic was
fully defined, both in France

00:07:14.155 --> 00:07:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and the United States, in
New York and San Francisco.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.520 align:middle line:84%
So I practiced there
a few years, decided--

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.330 align:middle line:84%
living in Marin County,
doing the bridges

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and going to eight or
10 hospitals a day.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.412 align:middle line:84%
If I had tried to even find
parking in San Francisco-

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:33.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
most stressful part.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: -was not for me.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And I just said I'm
not going to live

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.390 align:middle line:84%
a long time if I
had to keep that up.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:90%
I liked Reno.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:90%
I always liked Tahoe.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:90%
We went skiing there.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I had a condo up at
the lake at that time.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:84%
So I decided I'm
going to go to Reno.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
They didn't have any
oncologists here in town,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.380 align:middle line:90%
so it was an open field.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Las Vegas had only
two oncologists at the time.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
They tried to get me to go down
there, but I preferred Reno.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.590 align:middle line:90%
I prefer the seasons.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.480 align:middle line:84%
So, I became the
first oncologist here,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:84%
started all three cancer
wards here in Reno.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was head of the
VA cancer program.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I was also
an associate professor

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.310 align:middle line:84%
of medicine with
the medical school.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what
I'm hearing here

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:84%
is you've been in
this field essentially

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.637 align:middle line:90%
since the term was coined.

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you
have seen every trend

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:90%
that has come and gone.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And so now that
we have you placed

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and ID'd, and you're in the
field of oncology solidly,

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.690 align:middle line:84%
you've started your centers,
let's start at a turning

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.559 align:middle line:84%
point in your life,
which was the woman

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.900 align:middle line:84%
with the brown
recluse spider bite.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.855 align:middle line:90%
I love that story in your book.

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:44.730 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yeah.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.320 align:middle line:10%
I use that in my Take
Control Of Your Cancer book

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.230 align:middle line:10%
because it was so
dramatic and so meaningful

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.940 align:middle line:10%
to me, because it really made
the lights go on in the attic

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:10%
and realize that the
things I was doing,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:10%
which weren't that dramatic in
terms of the response rates I

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.742 align:middle line:10%
was getting, were not enough.

00:09:03.742 --> 00:09:04.700 align:middle line:90%
And the immune system--

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Tell the
story about the woman.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: The woman-- and
we won't use any names here--

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.400 align:middle line:84%
but she was a woman
in her mid '60s, who

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.840 align:middle line:84%
was a ranch lady who owned
a big ranch in Alturas,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.830 align:middle line:84%
California, which was
just north of Susanville.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
She had been under my
care for about three years

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.480 align:middle line:84%
for a malignant
melanoma, black mold

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.660 align:middle line:84%
tumor that had
gone to her liver.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.165 align:middle line:84%
And I was using the best
chemo that we had at the time.

00:09:32.165 --> 00:09:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that
would be stage IV?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Stage III?

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
Stage IV disease.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And usually patients with
stage IV disease with melanoma,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
even at that time, barely
made it six months to a year;

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.965 align:middle line:84%
so, I felt quite
fortunate that she

00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:45.970 align:middle line:90%
was living up to three years.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
But I knew her time was
coming to an end shortly.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, it so happened
that on the ranch,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
she put on a pair of boots she
hadn't worn in many months.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And, lo and behold, there was
a nest of brown recluse spiders

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
in one of the boots
and she got stung.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, she had a horrendous
reaction on her leg.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.155 align:middle line:84%
The leg swelled up, it
was red, it was inflamed.

00:10:08.155 --> 00:10:09.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It can be lethal.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Cellulitis.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And she was so sick that we had
to hospitalize her and put her

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
on multiple antibiotics and
blood thinners and so on.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Before going into the
hospital that she had

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.260 align:middle line:84%
had documented liver scans,
which showed multiple lesions

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
on her liver consistent with
her metastatic melanoma.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Well after the
hospitalization, which

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
took about two to three
weeks to clear her up,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.090 align:middle line:84%
decided to repeat some of her
scans and see where we were.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And, lo and behold,
the liver scan now

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.367 align:middle line:84%
was completely negative and
her liver function tests

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:90%
were negative.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.440 align:middle line:90%
So I was just amazed by it.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
I just presumed that the
fact she hadn't had any chemo

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
during that period, that it
had to be the infection that

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
was revving up
her immune system.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And the tremendous response
she had to the spider venom

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.934 align:middle line:84%
was now responsible for
perhaps curing her cancer.

00:11:05.934 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Kicking her immune
system into high gear--

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Kicking it up.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Revving it up.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: -on some level.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:10.443 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:11:10.443 --> 00:11:14.325 align:middle line:84%
And that just really turned
on a lot of lights for me.

00:11:14.325 --> 00:11:17.200 align:middle line:84%
It made me think
that there's got

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
to be a better way, a more
natural way of treating

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:90%
cancers.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Also at that time, I
was seeing patients

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
from naturopaths and
homeopaths in the community.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I was the only guy
that would communicate

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.700 align:middle line:84%
with these doctors,
who were considered

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.100 align:middle line:84%
fringe doctors and
some people thought

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
of them as quackery doctors,
but they were getting some very

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.970 align:middle line:90%
interesting and good results--

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Even with
cancer patients?

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: -with
their cancer patients.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't fit
my paradigm that I

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
had learned you have to do
surgery, then radiation, then

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:90%
chemo.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.480 align:middle line:90%
And that's all there was.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So I said in order for me to
push the envelope and do this,

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to become
boarded in homeopathy as well

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
as straight
conventional medicine.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
So I did that.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
I took my training at
the British Institute

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.400 align:middle line:84%
of Homeopathy, which is
a correspondence course.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.230 align:middle line:84%
After two years, we took very
extensive tests, both oral

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.560 align:middle line:84%
and written, and I got my degree
in homeopathy and my boards

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.290 align:middle line:90%
in homeopathy.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.640 align:middle line:90%
So now I was under two boards.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
That allowed me to
push the envelope

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:84%
and to think out of the
box, and to do things

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
that-- I tried to be quite
transparent in the community

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.620 align:middle line:84%
so other doctors knew
what I was doing.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, naturally I
lost some referrals,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
I lost some friendships, I lost
some status in the community

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:84%
just because I had
wandered outside of

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.780 align:middle line:84%
the straight and narrow box
and the way of doing things

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.490 align:middle line:90%
in oncology.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.030 align:middle line:84%
Because if you didn't
do things by protocol,

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.260 align:middle line:84%
by recipe exactly
that way, you were

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.620 align:middle line:84%
considered to be a
little bit of a maverick.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That hasn't changed.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.760 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: It really
hasn't changed, no.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: All these years
later, it hasn't changed.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:01.620 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to jump forward for
a moment in this story to just

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
one thing to get
people's attention really

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:90%
strong and clear right now.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.075 align:middle line:84%
And that is give us
the survival rates.

00:13:11.075 --> 00:13:12.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's the five
year rate that you use,

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
the five year survival
rate of stage IV cancer as

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.035 align:middle line:84%
per the use of the
normal strategy,

00:13:19.035 --> 00:13:21.326 align:middle line:84%
which you just talked about,
which is chemo, radiation,

00:13:21.326 --> 00:13:22.754 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, and surgery.

00:13:22.754 --> 00:13:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes, Regina.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.630 align:middle line:84%
This did happen later on when I
started seeing articles pop up

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
in the conventional oncology
literature that was showing

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.770 align:middle line:84%
the survival rates of five years
of chemotherapy for adult stage

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.430 align:middle line:84%
IV cancers, and comparable
studies that were done

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
in Australia at the
same time showing

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:90%
in the range of a 2.1% to 2.3%.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
That means 2 out of 100
patients alive at five years.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
Now that just turned my head
completely around and I said I

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:90%
cannot be part of this.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And I remembered the fact that
Richard Nixon declared his War

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:84%
on Cancer in 1972
and this was supposed

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.185 align:middle line:84%
to cure all cancers
within a matter of--

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 40 years ago.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: -10 or 20 years.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.020 align:middle line:84%
But at that time
they-- at this time

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:15.210 align:middle line:84%
now, there's been
over $110 billion

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.610 align:middle line:84%
thrown at the cancer industry,
and yet the survival rate

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.580 align:middle line:90%
is not any better.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:84%
This article that
I'm referring to

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.534 align:middle line:84%
came out in 2004 in the
American Journal of Oncology.

00:14:26.534 --> 00:14:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
shouldn't expect there's

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.400 align:middle line:84%
been a huge shift in
the last eight years?

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:30.740 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: There hasn't.

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.948 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: There has not been.

00:14:31.948 --> 00:14:33.240 align:middle line:90%
Eight, nine years even.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And now, just so that we
have everyone's attention,

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.500 align:middle line:84%
what is the latest
stat that you have

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:84%
for your clinic and other
alternative integrated oncology

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.470 align:middle line:90%
clinics?

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.827 align:middle line:84%
What is the five year
survival rate right now?

00:14:49.827 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
to be honest with you,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only alternative
doctor in the country that I'm

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.720 align:middle line:84%
aware of that actually keeps
track of and keeps numbers

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:84%
and does what we call
outcome based studies.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.847 align:middle line:84%
By outcome based,
I mean what happens

00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:84%
to the patient from the
day you start treating him

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
until whatever
their survival is.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Is it three years?

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:90%
Four years?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Five years?

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it just six months?

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
So in my present study,
I have 450 patients,

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
actually closer to
500 at this point.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:84%
My last meeting, which
was several months ago

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.280 align:middle line:84%
that I presented the data at,
showed a 72% overall survival

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:36.140 align:middle line:84%
rate of adult stage IV
cancers of all types.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.450 align:middle line:90%
So that--

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just wanted you
to put this into perspective

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.390 align:middle line:84%
because it always is
shocking and horribly

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.860 align:middle line:84%
disappointing to me
to hear the stories

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that people like yourself
tell about what you've

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
had to go through just to fight
for the right to help people

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.959 align:middle line:90%
like us.

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And look at the difference
in the survival rates,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.947 align:middle line:84%
a 70% difference in
the survival rates.

00:15:56.947 --> 00:15:57.780 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hoping to
do is get to five years

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and compare what I
have at five years

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:84%
using my combination of
conventional and alternative

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
medicine, so-called
integrative oncology,

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:90%
and see how that compares.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.122 align:middle line:90%
I know we're going to beat 2%.

00:16:15.122 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:90%
There's no question about it.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Beat 2%?

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.194 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I would think so.

00:16:18.194 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:84%
You're at what, the three
year mark right now?

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: We're at almost
the three year mark, yes.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.435 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Three year
mark and you're at 72%.

00:16:23.435 --> 00:16:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So we
have to check back

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.156 align:middle line:84%
with you in a couple of
years and see where you are.

00:16:27.156 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:90%
It's sounding pretty good.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:90%
You're going to beat the 2%.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And to be fair,
we do have to match the time.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And also, we're not
padding our statistics

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:40.340 align:middle line:84%
with cancers that are easy
to treat like prostate

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and breast are considered
the easier cancers to treat.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.170 align:middle line:90%
We have all comers.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:90%
We have colorectal.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.010 align:middle line:90%
We have sarcomas.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.460 align:middle line:90%
We have pancreas.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:90%
We have gallbladder cancers.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.394 align:middle line:84%
We have numerous very
difficult cancers to treat.

00:16:53.394 --> 00:16:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And now during
this whole time-- and we'll

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.268 align:middle line:84%
get this part out of
the way because when

00:16:57.268 --> 00:16:58.870 align:middle line:84%
we start talking
about what people

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.960 align:middle line:84%
can do to help themselves
and about screening, testing,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:84%
what you start with when
someone comes in-- for all

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.456 align:middle line:84%
of your good work, the FDA
keeps coming after you.

00:17:10.456 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:84%
You have spent,
we spoke about it

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
off camera, a lot of
money in legal fees

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.030 align:middle line:84%
to be able to just continue
offering your services.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And in your book, it said
over a 15 year period,

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:84%
you've had something like
20 different investigations.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Almost like clockwork
they'll come after you again.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
an uncommon thing

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:84%
for those who dare to go outside
of the conventional medicine

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.879 align:middle line:90%
box, is it?

00:17:31.879 --> 00:17:32.670 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: No.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.210 align:middle line:84%
You do set yourself up
for the slings and arrows

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
of outrageous fortune,
as Shakespeare would say.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be willing to
do that and take those chances.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I did
beat the FDA in court

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:84%
on the case that occurred
in 2005, where they actually

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
raided my home and my business
with several dozen agents

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.030 align:middle line:84%
from different parts of
the federal government,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:06.860 align:middle line:84%
including the FBI, the FDA,
ICE, Immigrations, Customs.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And the investigation started
at that time, ended up

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.600 align:middle line:84%
in a grand jury
indictment; which

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
as you know, a grand jury
can indict a ham sandwich,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:90%
as they say.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You bet.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.575 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
You can't provide

00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:21.330 align:middle line:90%
any defense in those hearings.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And then prior to trial, they
had an epiphany and said,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:84%
well, Dr. Forsythe must know a
lot about human growth hormone

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
because he's treated
a lot of patients,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.190 align:middle line:84%
so they had me write a national
protocol, which they signed off

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.690 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.200 align:middle line:84%
The prosecutors and the
federal judge signed off on it,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:90%
the FDA signed off.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So now I was holding
the national protocol

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.230 align:middle line:84%
for human growth hormone
deficiency syndrome,

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and so I thought the
whole thing was over.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, it wasn't.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to still
do some things to me

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:90%
without going to trial.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Number one, put me on
a two year probation.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:03.380 align:middle line:84%
Plus charge me over $100,000
for investigative fees.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.296 align:middle line:84%
And we simply told
the prosecutor no,

00:19:06.296 --> 00:19:08.420 align:middle line:84%
we're going to go to trial
and let the jury decide.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.480 align:middle line:84%
I felt very confident because
the drug that I was using,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.620 align:middle line:84%
the human growth hormone
drug from Israel, was

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
said by the FDA
to be unapproved;

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:84%
whereas it was in their own
orange book of approved drugs

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.670 align:middle line:90%
and had been since 1996.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And it was also on their
internet as being approved.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.340 align:middle line:84%
So they hadn't even
taken the time or trouble

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:90%
to check their website.

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So it was quite
amusing, so the judge

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:41.091 align:middle line:84%
threw out that particular part
of the indictment right away.

00:19:41.091 --> 00:19:42.590 align:middle line:84%
But the other part
of the indictment

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.090 align:middle line:84%
was even more
interesting because it

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
was that I was using an
unrecognized form of medicine,

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.950 align:middle line:84%
namely anti-aging medicine,
which the FDA does not

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:90%
like the term anti-aging.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Age management is OK,
but anti-aging is no-no.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.290 align:middle line:90%
And here's another funny story.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:07.741 align:middle line:84%
The prosecutor when
he got up at my trial

00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:09.490 align:middle line:84%
and looked at the jury,
he says, you know,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.050 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Forsythe practices
anti-aging medicine.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.330 align:middle line:90%
He said, we all get old and die.

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:84%
I looked at my
attorney, I said, Kevin,

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:90%
I think we've won this case.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Because this guy was so
far behind the curve,

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why would we treat
any diseases of aging.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:25.614 align:middle line:90%
I mean really.

00:20:25.614 --> 00:20:27.571 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right, which
is chronic degeneration,

00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:28.145 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:20:28.145 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yeah.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.027 align:middle line:84%
Basically strokes,
cancer, heart disease--

00:20:31.027 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But, you know
what's interesting--

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.320 align:middle line:84%
and again, we were talking
about this off camera-- you

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.200 align:middle line:84%
can give every other
kind of hormone,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:84%
any hormone besides that, can
be prescribed to a patient.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing
that kind of hits

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:50.340 align:middle line:84%
central to all of that,
HGH, human growth hormone--

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.860 align:middle line:84%
I think you said you're one
of the only doctors that

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.000 align:middle line:84%
can actually prescribe
human growth hormone?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
Since my trial, yes.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm the only one that
can legally prescribe it,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.770 align:middle line:84%
even though 20,000 or 30,000
doctors throughout the country

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:90%
are doing it under the radar.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But we always learned
in med school,

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.680 align:middle line:84%
as you just mentioned,
Regina, that we

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.060 align:middle line:84%
were taught that if
you have any hormone

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:84%
deficiency in the body, thyroid,
sex hormones, adrenal hormones,

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.129 align:middle line:84%
you can replace
those with impunity.

00:21:18.129 --> 00:21:19.420 align:middle line:90%
And you're supposed to do that.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:90%
It's part of good medicine.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And the whole
business of treating

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:27.260 align:middle line:84%
menopause now with
bioidentical hormone therapies

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.200 align:middle line:84%
and andropause, or the male
equivalent of menopause,

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
with testosterone
and DHA and so on,

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
treating the low
adrenal function

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:43.150 align:middle line:84%
with adrenal cortical hormones,
all those things have evolved

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:90%
and are part of modern medicine.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But why not HGH then?

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.370 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: But HGH
was completely a no-no

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:51.520 align:middle line:84%
from the FDA, and remains
that way still today,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
even though my trial set
precedent to the opposite.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to be
an expert witness

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:04.570 align:middle line:84%
in many cases around the
country just to provide support

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.730 align:middle line:84%
to the doctors who are
under fire from the FDA.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it
would almost make

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:84%
you think they didn't want you
live a long and fruitful life

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:10.580 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.454 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
if you're cynical, yes,

00:22:12.454 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
they don't want us
to not be able to use

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:84%
all those expensive
big pharma drugs

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.190 align:middle line:84%
as we age for osteoporosis,
heart disease, hypertension,

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:20.690 align:middle line:90%
cholesterol.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: When HGH is
cheap and really kind

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:24.650 align:middle line:84%
of cuts to the core
of a lot of that.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:25.525 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yeah.

00:22:25.525 --> 00:22:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And people with HGH
who get replaced

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.570 align:middle line:84%
don't get all these degenerative
diseases as rapidly.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we think it does
increase longevity as well,

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.390 align:middle line:84%
although we don't have the
time studies yet to prove that.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:40.371 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:22:40.371 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going back on
the track of oncology,

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
things-- that's why

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.540 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to talk
about or stats rates

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:84%
right up front so people
understand this-- now,

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
this whole persuading
of the mass human psyche

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.270 align:middle line:84%
that there's really
only one way to go

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:02.680 align:middle line:84%
has been stepped up
through the advertising

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.100 align:middle line:84%
industry and the media
and so forth as well.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I read in your
book that I hadn't known before

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:84%
was that I think-- clarify it
if I'm wrong-- that the United

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.620 align:middle line:84%
States and New Zealand are the
only countries that are allowed

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.059 align:middle line:90%
to advertise pharmaceuticals.

00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: That's correct.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's correct?

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:19.543 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:23:19.543 --> 00:23:20.919 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every other ad
is pharmaceuticals here.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.130 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And
think about those ads.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Would you, as an
intelligent human being,

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:84%
ever take half the
drugs they advertise

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:33.387 align:middle line:90%
when they list 10 or 12.

00:23:33.387 --> 00:23:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Rectal
bleeding, depression.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Cancer.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Death.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.170 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Possibly suicide.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:38.900 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Suicide.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:84%
You'd be nuts as
a patient, you'd

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.310 align:middle line:84%
be nuts as a doctor to
prescribe any of them

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because there's so many horrible
things that can happen to you.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, death from FDA
approved drugs is supposedly

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.910 align:middle line:84%
the fifth to six leading cause
of death in the United States.

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:53.826 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, indeed.

00:23:53.826 --> 00:23:55.580 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk
about the effects,

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
the toxic and poisonous effects
of using, in an unwise fashion,

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.620 align:middle line:84%
using the traditional
cancer protocols

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:84%
such as radiation
and chemotherapy.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And then, how you go
about identifying what's

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:90%
needed in a body.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.720 align:middle line:84%
But first, let's talk about what
actually happens to most people

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:16.630 align:middle line:84%
when they go in, they get
their diagnosis normally.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.367 align:middle line:84%
Not with you, but with a
normal oncologist or HMO.

00:24:20.367 --> 00:24:21.200 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was on that side of
the fence for many years,

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.490 align:middle line:90%
so I speak with some authority.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.230 align:middle line:84%
But you can kill patients on
the first round of chemotherapy,

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:84%
and it has been done many
times, believe it or not,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.110 align:middle line:84%
just by giving the full
dose of chemotherapy

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.240 align:middle line:84%
because patients can
develop severe cytopenias.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.710 align:middle line:84%
That means their blood counts
drop out; white count is low,

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:44.400 align:middle line:84%
the platelets are low,
the red count is down.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So they can get
bleeding problems,

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.500 align:middle line:84%
they can get severe
sepsis or infections,

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.330 align:middle line:84%
pneumonias, and not recover from
those because their body is so

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.700 align:middle line:84%
depleted after the
bombardment with full dose

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.430 align:middle line:90%
toxic chemotherapy.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of the protocols
that come out initially

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:84%
are overweighted to the side
of overdoing, overdosing

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.530 align:middle line:90%
the drugs.

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
For instance, a
drug like Xeloda,

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
which is an oral
form of 5-FU chemo,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.370 align:middle line:84%
was supposed to be given
two weeks out of three

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:84%
in this enormous dose that no
patients could ever tolerate.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.870 align:middle line:84%
They would get what's called
hand-foot syndrome, where

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:90%
they'd get red palms and soles.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.950 align:middle line:90%
They'd get chronic diarrheas.

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:90%
They'd get skin rashes.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.650 align:middle line:84%
They'd get all kinds
of horrendous things,

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.670 align:middle line:90%
including chemo brain.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:36.796 align:middle line:84%
And they finally had to lower
the dose to about 1/3 to 1/2

00:25:36.796 --> 00:25:38.420 align:middle line:84%
as much as they were
giving originally.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:84%
And then instead of giving
it two weeks out of three,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:46.370 align:middle line:84%
it's now every other week, which
is a lower form of giving it.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:47.340 align:middle line:90%
So things like that.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And then there are drugs
that have come out,

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.340 align:middle line:84%
very expensive
drugs like Iressa,

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:56.000 align:middle line:84%
which I mentioned in my
book, a drug for lung cancer,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.540 align:middle line:84%
nonsmall cell lung cancer
that was costing patients

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.179 align:middle line:84%
out of pocket sometimes $25,000
a year for one pill a day.

00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: One pill a day.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.460 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And
Iressa was found

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
after being out
five years, Regina,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.860 align:middle line:84%
to be no better
than a placebo drug,

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.210 align:middle line:84%
so it was taken off the
market for lung cancer.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.462 align:middle line:84%
It's still out there,
but no one uses it.

00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:19.045 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Someone
made a lot of money.

00:26:19.045 --> 00:26:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yeah.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:25.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But the point is that
there are no set protocols too,

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.780 align:middle line:90%
and that part is interesting.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.330 align:middle line:90%
You can go to one oncologist.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.970 align:middle line:84%
They'll have one
set of protocols

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.620 align:middle line:90%
for you and one treatment plan.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Another oncologist will have
a completely different one,

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.420 align:middle line:84%
meaning there is
nothing sure, there's

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:84%
nothing standardized even
about these therapies.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:44.280 align:middle line:84%
Unless you're with one HMO
that says this is how it goes,

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.130 align:middle line:90%
period.

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:45.710 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Right.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting thing, and
I do mention this in my book

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
as well, that if you
go to these meetings

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.980 align:middle line:84%
where you have 100
or 200 oncologists,

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.650 align:middle line:84%
they'll give you a test case
and you have a keypad in front

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.270 align:middle line:84%
of you and you're all
supposed to be answering

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:84%
what the correct treatment
is, never any consensus.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:04.880 align:middle line:90%
Never any consensus.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.480 align:middle line:90%
It might be 30-70.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:90%
It might be 40-60.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't agree.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.480 align:middle line:90%
And you think, my gosh.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.855 align:middle line:84%
Here's oncologists, they're
all going by the book--

00:27:15.855 --> 00:27:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: There should
be something standard.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:18.242 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:27:18.242 --> 00:27:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: -they should
all be on the same page.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:21.116 align:middle line:90%
But they're not.

00:27:21.116 --> 00:27:23.756 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.756 --> 00:27:26.500 align:middle line:84%
It just tells you that
there's no consensus there.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the pressure
is on them, though.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.600 align:middle line:84%
How does this kind
of chain of events

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.670 align:middle line:84%
happen that people are shunted
off into a particular protocol

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.470 align:middle line:90%
with a particular set of drugs?

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
the insurance companies,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
the Medicare, Medicaid,
they have for every cancer--

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:84%
let's say if you
had breast cancer,

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.490 align:middle line:84%
there'd be a certain
list of drugs

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.950 align:middle line:84%
that a doctor, I, as an
oncologist, could offer you.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:84%
If I went outside that list, it
would be considered off label.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.490 align:middle line:84%
You might end up having
to pay for it yourself.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:27:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I could still give
it to you, Regina,

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:84%
but you'd probably have
to pay for the drug,

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and they get terribly expensive,
out of your own pocketbook.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of it's
financially driven,

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's definitely driven
kind of back backward

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.180 align:middle line:84%
by the pharmaceutical
industry it sounds like.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.055 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yeah.

00:28:15.055 --> 00:28:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Big pharma, of
course, and they don't

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.540 align:middle line:84%
know because when we do
chemo sensitivity testing,

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.050 align:middle line:84%
many drugs will pop up as
being effective for your breast

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.624 align:middle line:90%
cancer that aren't on any list.

00:28:24.624 --> 00:28:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.581 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Or they might
be just for colon cancer.

00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:29.210 align:middle line:90%
They might be for kidney cancer.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.727 align:middle line:90%
Yet they work for your cancer.

00:28:31.727 --> 00:28:32.560 align:middle line:90%
You see what I mean?

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.143 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:33.143 --> 00:28:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: So you'd
never find that out

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:37.060 align:middle line:84%
in conventional
oncology because you're

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:41.040 align:middle line:84%
beholden to the recipe that
is written by the insurance

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:41.640 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's go into
the way you do it.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So somebody arrives
at your office

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.454 align:middle line:84%
and you do a really key
test right off the bat.

00:28:49.454 --> 00:28:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Right.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And that's where our current
study is at the present time.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:84%
We'll call it 480 patients
at the 33 month period,

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.414 align:middle line:90%
again aiming for five years.

00:29:00.414 --> 00:29:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing
we do, first of all,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.380 align:middle line:84%
our patients are several
different varieties.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.430 align:middle line:90%
Some are virginal.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:07.730 align:middle line:90%
They've never had any chemo.

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
They want nothing
to do with chemo.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They've read all
the bad reports.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:84%
They've seen relatives
go through hell

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.950 align:middle line:84%
with their chemotherapy
and have all kinds

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.900 align:middle line:90%
of adverse toxicities.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Or they've been through the
whole range of chemotherapies,

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.120 align:middle line:84%
maybe two or three or
four rounds of chemo

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.170 align:middle line:84%
with different
protocols, and they've

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.610 align:middle line:84%
gotten ravaged with
different side effects

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and they say no more.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.800 align:middle line:90%
They just don't want anymore.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.567 align:middle line:84%
Or you have certain
religious sects

00:29:34.567 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:84%
like Seventh Day Adventists,
and some of the Mennonites,

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.580 align:middle line:84%
and the Hutterites and so on
throughout the country that

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
don't want conventional
therapy at all.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.970 align:middle line:84%
They'll go for
alternative therapy,

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:90%
they don't want full dose chemo.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's a whole variety
of patients we see,

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.160 align:middle line:84%
but mostly it's the
ones that have already

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.390 align:middle line:84%
been through chemo;
it has failed them.

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:58.330 align:middle line:84%
They've become disillusioned
with the chemo.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.590 align:middle line:84%
They've suffered a lot of toxic
side effects, neuropathies.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.790 align:middle line:84%
They might have
an enlarged heart.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
They might have liver
or kidney damage.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.650 align:middle line:84%
They might have rashes
that are horrendous.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:11.560 align:middle line:90%
Chemo brain frequently happens.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Which is what?

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:13.287 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:30:13.287 --> 00:30:14.120 align:middle line:90%
What is chemo brain?

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.994 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Chemo
brain occurs frequently

00:30:15.994 --> 00:30:19.110 align:middle line:84%
in breast cancer patients who've
been on six months of chemo

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:84%
following a biopsy of a stage
II or III breast cancer;

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.150 align:middle line:84%
and it generally
manifests itself

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:84%
in the form of cognitive
defects, memory losses,

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.190 align:middle line:84%
depression, a lack
of motivation,

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:90%
sometimes suicidal thoughts.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a
pleasant thing, and it

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:43.120 align:middle line:84%
can last for many
months or years

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.900 align:middle line:90%
after the chemo is completed.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So these people
have ended up on your doorstep

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:54.197 align:middle line:84%
and you analyze them for a
particular genetic marker?

00:30:54.197 --> 00:30:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: What
I do is tell them

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.680 align:middle line:84%
that what you have
done up to this point

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.030 align:middle line:90%
has been a guessing game.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.260 align:middle line:84%
The oncologist,
while well meaning--

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not trying to deride
oncologists in general

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:09.630 align:middle line:84%
because that's what they've
been trained to do-- but they're

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.430 align:middle line:84%
guessing from the
last conference

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.040 align:middle line:84%
they went to, from
the last article

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.623 align:middle line:84%
they've read in the
medical literature

00:31:15.623 --> 00:31:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that these two drugs are going
to work best for this patient

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:84%
just because she has a stage
IV breast cancer or a stage IV

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:90%
colorectal cancer.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.780 align:middle line:84%
When we do our
genetic testing, which

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.231 align:middle line:84%
is called the Chemo
Sensitivity Genetic Testing,

00:31:32.231 --> 00:31:33.980 align:middle line:84%
and there are three
labs in the world that

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.480 align:middle line:84%
do this very high level,
very high-tech testing.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm a pathologist by training,
but it's way above my pay grade

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I always tell them
because, even though I've

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.870 align:middle line:84%
run a dozen labs,
including three in Vietnam,

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:84%
this is way above a routine
pathologist's expertise.

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.500 align:middle line:84%
They have to harvest the cancer
cells from the blood sample

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.640 align:middle line:84%
we give them from your
body, and they isolate

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.810 align:middle line:84%
the circulating tumor
cells-- CTCs we call them--

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.770 align:middle line:84%
and then they're able to augment
those cells, in other words,

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.340 align:middle line:84%
proliferate them, grow
them in larger numbers,

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and then break them
down genetically.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And because of the
Human Genome Project,

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:12.106 align:middle line:90%
we know what all your genes do.

00:32:12.106 --> 00:32:13.730 align:middle line:84%
We can know if they
are over-expressed,

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.820 align:middle line:84%
under-expressed,
or they're mutated.

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And from that information,
we can tell what

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.580 align:middle line:84%
drugs, what supplements
and what hormones.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's a triple
advantage we're getting.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.572 align:middle line:84%
We're getting the
best drugs for you,

00:32:24.572 --> 00:32:26.030 align:middle line:84%
we're getting the
best supplements,

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and we're getting
the best hormones.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
marking for that person.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:30.040 align:middle line:90%
You know exactly.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.610 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And it's
specific for your breast

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.960 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not for any
other breast cancer.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:84%
Because your profile will
look entirely different

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.042 align:middle line:84%
than any other patient
with breast cancer.

00:32:38.042 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this has
been going on in Germany

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.570 align:middle line:90%
for quite a while, hasn't it?

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: It has been
for the last 10 years or so.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.021 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This
profiling and very low

00:32:45.021 --> 00:32:47.390 align:middle line:84%
dose targeted chemotherapy
as well, as I recall.

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.250 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, that's
the other part of our equation.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.820 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you about
that in a few seconds.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's follow through on this
story of the Chemo Sensitivity

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:90%
Testing.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:84%
It takes a couple weeks
to get the results.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.330 align:middle line:84%
They fax it back to us
or email it back to us.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Right away, I sit down
and write a protocol

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.410 align:middle line:84%
from my knowledge as
40 years in practice

00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:11.930 align:middle line:84%
as to what-- say they're
20 drugs out there

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:90%
that look good for you.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.090 align:middle line:84%
They do grade the drugs as
to the degree of efficacy,

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:20.800 align:middle line:84%
so I'm only looking for
drugs that are at least 80%

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.930 align:middle line:90%
effective.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.460 align:middle line:84%
No drug is ever 100%
effective; otherwise, we'd

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.230 align:middle line:90%
all be using it.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:30.106 align:middle line:84%
So if we get to 80% or
85%, that's probably max,

00:33:30.106 --> 00:33:31.980 align:middle line:84%
so we're never going to
get better than that.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.390 align:middle line:84%
But we have the two best
drugs in that range,

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.400 align:middle line:84%
plus we have all those
another dozen supplements.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.730 align:middle line:84%
So as an old military
guy, I tell them

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I like to hit the target with
rockets and with grenade bombs,

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.840 align:middle line:84%
with mortar fire
and smart bombs,

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.870 align:middle line:84%
and whatever it takes to
knock that target out.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to
hit it in such a way

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:55.710 align:middle line:84%
that the cancer cells are not
going to become resistant,

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:57.810 align:middle line:90%
which a cancer can do overnight.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Cancer cells are smart.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.600 align:middle line:84%
They know how to become
resistant to drugs,

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.520 align:middle line:84%
especially if you
use just one drug.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So I tell them that we're
now beyond the guessing games

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.434 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking about a
specific treatment that's

00:34:11.434 --> 00:34:13.809 align:middle line:84%
going to help you for sure,
and I can look you in the eye

00:34:13.809 --> 00:34:15.267 align:middle line:84%
and tell you this
is going to help.

00:34:15.267 --> 00:34:17.035 align:middle line:84%
It's not a guessing
game anymore.

00:34:17.035 --> 00:34:19.410 align:middle line:84%
Besides, I'm going to give
you that packet of supplements

00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that you're going
to take every day.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.159 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to recommend
certain dietary

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.659 align:middle line:90%
changes for you, alkalinization.

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do some detox
procedures on you that

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.460 align:middle line:84%
are going to help you
and cleanse your body.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do everything I can
to fortify your immune system,

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:84%
because I tell them, we
know from the AIDS epidemic

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:middle line:84%
in the early '80s that if your
immune system is dysfunctional,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.239 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to do well
because your immune system are

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:48.719 align:middle line:84%
your inherent fighters; they're
intrinsic to your system.

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.139 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones
that keep the viruses,

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:53.670 align:middle line:84%
the parasitic infections,
the bacterial infections,

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.260 align:middle line:90%
and the malignant diseases away.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.132 align:middle line:84%
They're out there
fighting for you.

00:34:58.132 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:84%
If your immune system
isn't working right,

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get
some bad things happen

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:07.590 align:middle line:84%
to you, like the AIDS patients
do who got Kaposi sarcomas, CNS

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:13.930 align:middle line:84%
lymphoma, anal and genital
cancers, cervical cancers,

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.350 align:middle line:90%
the list goes on and on.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So now you have
everybody detoxing,

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.390 align:middle line:84%
you have them on supplements,
homeopathic remedies,

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.110 align:middle line:84%
you have them-- now,
let's talk about low dose,

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.285 align:middle line:90%
highly targeted chemo.

00:35:24.285 --> 00:35:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yeah.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the second part
of the equation that

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.010 align:middle line:84%
makes most sense to
me, because we already

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.930 align:middle line:84%
have now the prescription,
the formula for what's

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:35.680 align:middle line:84%
going to make you
better, but do we

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.350 align:middle line:90%
want to give it in full dose?

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.537 align:middle line:84%
We always give that
option to patients

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:41.370 align:middle line:84%
because I'm under
conventional boards still,

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I have to ask them, do you want
to take what I'm giving you

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:47.810 align:middle line:84%
and go to your regular
oncologist and get full dose?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.790 align:middle line:84%
I don't get any
patients that want that.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I don't
think I've had any.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.360 align:middle line:84%
At least I can't
remember one, and I've

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:90%
done 1,000 patient studies.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.610 align:middle line:84%
So I say the next
best option is to do

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.380 align:middle line:84%
low dose insulin potentiated
nontoxic therapy,

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.720 align:middle line:84%
where we take
advantage of the fact

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:09.850 align:middle line:84%
that a cancer cell is a cell
that has many more insulin

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:13.140 align:middle line:84%
receptors than a normal cell
does; and because of that,

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
it avidly takes sugar
out of the environment.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.540 align:middle line:90%
That's how the PET scan works.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain how the PET
scan works, which lights up

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.760 align:middle line:84%
cancer anywhere in the
body because you're

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.544 align:middle line:84%
giving a radio tag
sugar molecule.

00:36:24.544 --> 00:36:25.710 align:middle line:90%
So that makes sense to them.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:90%
They can understand that.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:84%
When we give insulin
with the chemotherapy,

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.480 align:middle line:84%
we're basically doing a
Trojan horse phenomena.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.380 align:middle line:84%
We're tricking the
cancer cell into thinking

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.171 align:middle line:84%
that sugar is coming
along, whereas they're

00:36:38.171 --> 00:36:40.060 align:middle line:90%
getting hit by low dose chemo.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is more effective
because it's getting right

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:45.881 align:middle line:84%
into the cancer cell and it's
leaving the normal cells alone.

00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So they're not getting hair
loss, nausea and vomiting.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:48.925 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what
I was going to ask,

00:36:48.925 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
the side effects are
reduced, if not--

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: The side
effects are minimal.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Really minimal.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.750 align:middle line:84%
So unless they've had
a lot of prior chemo

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.679 align:middle line:84%
where their bone marrow
is already shot down,

00:36:58.679 --> 00:37:00.970 align:middle line:84%
we still have to monitor
their blood counts, of course,

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:04.320 align:middle line:84%
but they're not going to
get this horrific cytopenias

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.340 align:middle line:84%
that you'd see with
full dose chemo.

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:07.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And
our effects have--

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.640 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't have
believed this when

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I was doing conventional
chemo-- but we

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.700 align:middle line:84%
can see a response, a
dramatic 90% response

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.094 align:middle line:84%
in their tumor in
a four-week period.

00:37:20.094 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:84%
In that short of
a period of time.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.010 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And in your book, you
talk about the fact

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that when people are
told they have cancer,

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.050 align:middle line:84%
when they're confronted
with this, a lot of them

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:34.000 align:middle line:84%
are just like deer
in the headlights.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.230 align:middle line:90%
They can't hear the words.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a white noise that takes
over the brain that's fear.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Absolute fear.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.690 align:middle line:84%
And to sit with
someone like you that's

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.030 align:middle line:84%
saying we now can see exactly
what's going on and I can help.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.570 align:middle line:90%
You have very high compliance.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:49.987 align:middle line:90%
And that makes a big difference.

00:37:49.987 --> 00:37:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Very high.

00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And cancer patients, in
general, are very compliant.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.180 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to die.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:58.969 align:middle line:84%
They want to see their kids
graduate, kids get married.

00:37:58.969 --> 00:38:00.510 align:middle line:84%
They want to see
their grandchildren.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:84%
They have a lot to live for
and they are very compliant,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
empower themselves.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.140 align:middle line:84%
The things we're doing empower
them to be better patients

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:13.890 align:middle line:84%
because we do instruct them:
you've got to do your own diet.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
your own master.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.852 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take charge
of your own health now.

00:38:18.852 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
do these supplements.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.760 align:middle line:84%
You're going to do
these dietary things

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.310 align:middle line:84%
because your body
wants to get better.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Your body strives to be healthy.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.530 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to help it along.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And by giving a low
dose chemo, you're

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.450 align:middle line:84%
not really knocking out
their immune system.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.110 align:middle line:84%
You're basically,
because of the therapies

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.740 align:middle line:84%
we give with the IPT, or
insulin potentiating therapy,

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:42.480 align:middle line:90%
are immune boosting therapies.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:44.960 align:middle line:84%
We use high dose C.
We use Poly-MVA .

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.520 align:middle line:90%
We use L-glutathione.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.330 align:middle line:84%
We use our FIT protocol, which
is the Forsythe Immune Therapy

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.360 align:middle line:90%
IV.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.680 align:middle line:90%
We use peroxide.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And we can do these
all because I'm

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.907 align:middle line:84%
under the homeopathic boards,
where these are all allowed.

00:38:57.907 --> 00:38:59.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you just
said something a little bit

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.220 align:middle line:84%
ago, they're very compliant and
they will follow instructions.

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.590 align:middle line:84%
They'll follow instructions
with another doctor as well.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But the issue is, the doctors
are not informed and educated

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.250 align:middle line:84%
as to what creates the
cancer to begin with.

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.150 align:middle line:84%
So some very simple things that
you would say to a client such

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.440 align:middle line:84%
as you have to knock off
on the simple carbohydrates

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and sugars, for
example, that's not

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:22.600 align:middle line:84%
a piece of information
someone would get.

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So what happens if
you go in, you're

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.280 align:middle line:84%
being bombarded with
chemo and radiation

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and you're given no information
about the dietary changes that

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.160 align:middle line:84%
may have certainly
assisted in your getting

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.747 align:middle line:84%
into that situation
to begin with.

00:39:34.747 --> 00:39:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, you've
hit upon an excellent point

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.760 align:middle line:84%
here, because the
conventional oncologist either

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.055 align:middle line:84%
doesn't want to talk about the
physiology and biochemistry

00:39:44.055 --> 00:39:47.530 align:middle line:84%
of the body and how it works,
and the fact that low sugar

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.810 align:middle line:84%
diets are extremely essential
because you're starving

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.640 align:middle line:84%
the cancer when you're
on a low sugar diet.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.200 align:middle line:90%
You want to starve the cancer.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.470 align:middle line:84%
You want your body
be at an alkaline pH

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.130 align:middle line:84%
because cancers favor
an acid pH in your body.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.540 align:middle line:84%
As cancer grows, it
creates acid because it's

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:06.630 align:middle line:84%
destroying tissues, it's
creating lactic acid.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.680 align:middle line:84%
So your body is acid
when you're sick.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Not only with cancer, with
infectious diseases as well.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, aren't
almost all chronic diseases

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.275 align:middle line:90%
based in an acid environment?

00:40:20.275 --> 00:40:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Absolutely.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.120 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Whether it's
arthritis or anything?

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:23.953 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:40:23.953 --> 00:40:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Your body tends to
be acid, creating

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.910 align:middle line:84%
an alkaline environment
in your body

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:30.339 align:middle line:90%
prevents the growth of cancer.

00:40:30.339 --> 00:40:30.880 align:middle line:90%
We know that.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.810 align:middle line:84%
There are clinics devoted
only to pH balancing,

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:34.950 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.830 align:middle line:84%
There are clinics
devoted only to dieting,

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:39.730 align:middle line:84%
like the Gerson Clinic
or the Gonzalez Clinic.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.570 align:middle line:90%
So you see the whole spectrum.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:45.600 align:middle line:84%
We're trained in our clinic
to embody the whole approach,

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.100 align:middle line:84%
the holistic approach, where
we're using all of these things

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.933 align:middle line:90%
to a certain degree.

00:40:48.933 --> 00:40:52.070 align:middle line:84%
And even the detox procedures
where we're using colonics.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.800 align:middle line:84%
We're using things
like the BioMat,

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.089 align:middle line:90%
which emanates infrared.

00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:57.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's one
of my favorite things.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.400 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk to you
about that in a moment.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.220 align:middle line:90%
So let's go back to alkalinity.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.870 align:middle line:84%
What can an individual that's
listening to this right now

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.840 align:middle line:84%
do to just make
sure that they have

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.410 align:middle line:84%
a more alkaline
environment themselves.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.176 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
you can certainly

00:41:14.176 --> 00:41:17.000 align:middle line:84%
eat foodstuffs that are
naturally alkaline producing,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.390 align:middle line:84%
like the green powders, the
green organic vegetables, wheat

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:26.070 align:middle line:84%
grass, rye bread, barley, algae,
and a number of other things.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:30.461 align:middle line:84%
Eating broccoli, the
healthy vegetables.

00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:31.960 align:middle line:84%
There's so many
things you could do.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.654 align:middle line:84%
You could do alkaline
water on a regular basis.

00:41:34.654 --> 00:41:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean there are
some people that say, oh,

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.194 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't make
any difference,

00:41:38.194 --> 00:41:39.300 align:middle line:90%
alkaline water doesn't.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.800 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is,
you're saying it

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.430 align:middle line:84%
does if you can find a
way to take alkalines.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.980 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: But if you
can't afford the equipment

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.650 align:middle line:84%
to put it on your faucet
and bring the pH up,

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.290 align:middle line:84%
you could do bicarbonate
in water daily.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:90%
You can do--

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A little
bit of baking soda.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.566 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
Alka-Seltzer Cold.

00:41:54.566 --> 00:41:55.200 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.690 align:middle line:90%
And that's not very expensive.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Alka-Seltzer Cold,
a couple pills a day

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.034 align:middle line:90%
will alkalinize you too.

00:42:00.034 --> 00:42:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:01.190 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.773 align:middle line:84%
So there are ways
to take care of that

00:42:02.773 --> 00:42:05.590 align:middle line:84%
without getting into exotic
machinery and so forth.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, you were hitting
upon heat and using heat

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.352 align:middle line:84%
to be able to bring up
the core body temperature,

00:42:11.352 --> 00:42:12.810 align:middle line:84%
the temperature of
the cells, which

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:16.014 align:middle line:84%
also is unfriendly to
certain viruses and cancers.

00:42:16.014 --> 00:42:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And you just
mentioned the BioMat,

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's partly
how I know of you.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I've been sleeping on one of
those for the last six years.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.960 align:middle line:84%
And I found out about
it through someone else.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.134 align:middle line:84%
And basically had a
nasty chest infection

00:42:27.134 --> 00:42:28.050 align:middle line:90%
that wouldn't go away.

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And within 48
hours, it was gone.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So of course I'm out on rooftops
shouting to everybody about it.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, you also came
into contact with that

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.310 align:middle line:84%
through a mutual person
named Suzette that we know.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:42.000 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk
about how that's

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.840 align:middle line:84%
being utilized in
your cancer protocols

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and what you're seeing
by way of effects.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.790 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, yes.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.520 align:middle line:84%
The protocol we use is called
the Forsythe Immune Therapy,

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.770 align:middle line:84%
which encompasses
the whole product.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not just one simple thing.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it's
dietary, it's supplements.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.356 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Supplements.

00:43:00.356 --> 00:43:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Its oxygenation.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Alkalizing.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.428 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Alkalization.

00:43:03.428 --> 00:43:05.010 align:middle line:90%
It's detoxification.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the BioMat comes in,

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because we feel we're
detoxing the body as we sleep.

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:12.210 align:middle line:84%
And sure, you can go
in an infrared sauna,

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.062 align:middle line:84%
but then you're sitting in a
sauna sweating for 1/2 hour

00:43:15.062 --> 00:43:15.770 align:middle line:90%
or an hour a day.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:20.120 align:middle line:84%
And most people, their
time is so tight these days

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.720 align:middle line:84%
with everything that's
going on, and our culture

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:26.084 align:middle line:84%
is so fast paced, it's
so nice to have something

00:43:26.084 --> 00:43:28.000 align:middle line:84%
where you can just go
to bed and lay on a mat,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.350 align:middle line:84%
and while you're sleeping,
you're getting treated.

00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:32.934 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
happens with the BioMat.

00:43:32.934 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:84%
While you're sleeping,
you've got a heating element.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.005 align:middle line:84%
Plus you've got
far infrared rays.

00:43:37.005 --> 00:43:39.850 align:middle line:84%
You've got negative ions
coming up six to eight inches

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.110 align:middle line:90%
through your body.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's healing.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.480 align:middle line:84%
It's stimulating
the immune system.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.920 align:middle line:90%
It's helping your pain.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So it's got so many
advantages, very comfortable.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.360 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it's addicting.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.818 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
get used to that--

00:43:51.818 --> 00:43:53.516 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I can vouch for that.

00:43:53.516 --> 00:43:54.705 align:middle line:84%
It is, and you just
want to get in bed.

00:43:54.705 --> 00:43:55.192 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Once
you get used to it,

00:43:55.192 --> 00:43:57.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't want to go-- you
hate to even leave home

00:43:57.610 --> 00:43:58.370 align:middle line:90%
to go to a hotel.

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, it seems
to have this very tonic

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:03.736 align:middle line:84%
and soothing effect on the
nervous system as well.

00:44:03.736 --> 00:44:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And, as you're saying,
it does reduce--

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.734 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people who
have had pain reduced with it.

00:44:07.734 --> 00:44:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But this subtle effect
outside of the detoxification

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.790 align:middle line:84%
of the cells and raising
of the cellular temperature

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and working on that level,
what about more subtle aspects

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.050 align:middle line:84%
of that kind of technology
and other things that

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:25.430 align:middle line:84%
bring about this deeper
sense of rest within the body

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.600 align:middle line:90%
and within the nervous system?

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.080 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, I think
that certainly helps that.

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.909 align:middle line:84%
I think people sleep better
when their body is being healed,

00:44:35.909 --> 00:44:37.200 align:middle line:90%
and your body is being treated.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.170 align:middle line:84%
You're being given
therapy while you sleep,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:84%
which is amazing because
most of the time, people

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:46.492 align:middle line:84%
consider sleep a waste of their
time, nothing is happening.

00:44:46.492 --> 00:44:48.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
that's a technology--

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.780 align:middle line:84%
that particular technology
came out of Japan and Korea.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.295 align:middle line:84%
And in Japan, I think
it's been maybe what, 15,

00:44:54.295 --> 00:44:57.480 align:middle line:84%
20 years that that
technology has been used.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's a little book
that I came in contact

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.240 align:middle line:84%
with years ago called The
Fourth Treatment, which

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:05.830 align:middle line:84%
was using this in addition
to traditional cancer

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.030 align:middle line:90%
treatments in Japan.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And so, what are
you seeing, again,

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:14.290 align:middle line:84%
just encapsulating it, what are
you seeing by way of effects

00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:17.380 align:middle line:84%
along with the chemo
and the other treatments

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.842 align:middle line:84%
you're doing with that
particular heat therapy.

00:45:19.842 --> 00:45:22.300 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, we've
noticed that our survival rates

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.480 align:middle line:84%
are going up since we've
started incorporating that

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.560 align:middle line:90%
as part of our FIT therapy.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.420 align:middle line:84%
There's no question about our
patients are doing better.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:84%
They're complaining
less of pain.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.860 align:middle line:84%
Their quality of
sleep is better.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.660 align:middle line:84%
And I feel their immune
function is better as well,

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.410 align:middle line:84%
because we do test the immune
function of our patient.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:42.390 align:middle line:84%
We test B and T cell function
and natural killer cell

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:43.240 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.340 align:middle line:84%
We do notice their immune
function is improved.

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's fabulous.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: So it has
some very positive benefits

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:53.369 align:middle line:84%
and it's a very reasonable
price for what you're getting.

00:45:53.369 --> 00:45:54.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I think so too.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I've been sold on that.

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.350 align:middle line:90%
All my friends have.

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:59.350 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to push it on
my family and everyone.

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.482 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody is
into alternatives.

00:46:01.482 --> 00:46:02.690 align:middle line:90%
But, yeah, I agree with that.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.814 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And it's
a part of energy medicine.

00:46:04.814 --> 00:46:08.320 align:middle line:84%
I think we really
underutilize energy medicine.

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:84%
We have the acupuncture
points, we have them ready.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:16.940 align:middle line:84%
The Vohl procedure and
kinesiology and things

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.790 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But this is a form of
energy medicine, I feel.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, now let's talk
about detoxing

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.060 align:middle line:84%
the body of heavy metals
and how that factors in.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Do you see excessive metals
in your blood analysis

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:35.990 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of your
clients, for example?

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Is that common?

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:38.590 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
we do hair analysis.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't do blood analysis.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.770 align:middle line:84%
But hair analysis is
very, very critical

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:45.020 align:middle line:84%
because we're really looking
for a trigger, as opposed

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.580 align:middle line:84%
to conventional oncologists,
who couldn't care less where

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.857 align:middle line:84%
your cancer came from,
to be honest with you.

00:46:49.857 --> 00:46:50.940 align:middle line:90%
That's not their interest.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Their interest is
putting you on the IV

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:55.130 align:middle line:90%
drip with the toxic chemo.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to say that, but
they're not interested at all

00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:59.360 align:middle line:84%
if you have a trigger
in your system.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.150 align:middle line:84%
We are interested
in that, because we

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:05.110 align:middle line:84%
find many patients have
toxicities in their hair

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that are carcinogens like
arsenic, like uranium,

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.407 align:middle line:90%
like cadmium, like antimony.

00:47:12.407 --> 00:47:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So their cancer
could have been environmental?

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.573 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Yes.

00:47:15.573 --> 00:47:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And, for instance, if we
see mercury, nickel, silver,

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.547 align:middle line:84%
and tin, it's almost always
the mouth, the culprit,

00:47:21.547 --> 00:47:22.880 align:middle line:90%
because of your silver amalgams.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:24.671 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we're
going to get into that.

00:47:24.671 --> 00:47:25.490 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: If we see
arsenic, it may be groundwater.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.630 align:middle line:84%
For instance, in this area
here, in Reno, northern Nevada,

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.140 align:middle line:84%
extending all the way up
to Fallon and Fernley,

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.960 align:middle line:84%
towns 50 miles
east of here, there

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:39.640 align:middle line:84%
was a leukemic epidemic where
the EPA came in and found

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:84%
the groundwater was 20 to 30
times as high with arsenic

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.380 align:middle line:90%
as it should be.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.720 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: I remember that.

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And
they have cleaned it up.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.130 align:middle line:84%
They've spent millions of
dollars cleaning their water

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:50.130 align:middle line:90%
supply.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.090 align:middle line:84%
The leukemic epidemic
is now stopped.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.310 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And so you-- how does
that help you to identify,

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean obviously if you have
a particular element out

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:06.020 align:middle line:84%
of balance in your body, you
can start leaching that out.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I mean you can
start detoxifying.

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:11.466 align:middle line:84%
Besides that, how does it help
you know what the source was?

00:48:11.466 --> 00:48:14.010 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, it
helps you in the respect

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.540 align:middle line:84%
that if you clear
up this cancer, then

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.690 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to necessarily
get a second cancer right away.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.030 align:middle line:84%
If you cleared up the
breast cancer here,

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:25.270 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to worry
about three years later

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.730 align:middle line:84%
getting the opposite
breast necessarily

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:29.560 align:middle line:84%
if you're still
holding the trigger.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.070 align:middle line:84%
But by chelating those toxic
metals out of your body,

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.712 align:middle line:84%
you're hopefully going to
prevent that from happening.

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, you just
brought up a good point

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and you touched on
it a moment ago,

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and that is amalgam and its
direct correlation to breast

00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.114 align:middle line:90%
cancer.

00:48:46.114 --> 00:48:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've been reading a bit
about this the last few years.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:49.825 align:middle line:90%
What is your experience?

00:48:49.825 --> 00:48:51.950 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, I do
mention this in my book,

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:54.190 align:middle line:84%
and it's been studied
in Europe extensively.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:59.420 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Rau in Switzerland has noted
that disease in the premolar

00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.370 align:middle line:84%
teeth, especially the upper
teeth, the maxillary teeth,

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.520 align:middle line:84%
there's a high correlation with
breast cancer on the same side

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.370 align:middle line:90%
as the dental problem is.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:09.940 align:middle line:90%
A very high correlation.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just a coincidence
that the dental meridian

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.054 align:middle line:84%
to that side lead right
to the breast meridian.

00:49:16.054 --> 00:49:16.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.330 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: And
so you know you've

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:23.670 align:middle line:84%
got an influence there from the
dental infection to the breast

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.540 align:middle line:90%
cancer developing.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about detection.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And I did do another story
with a dentist in England named

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Allison Adams, and she
talked quite a bit about this

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.640 align:middle line:84%
as well, so people can refer
to that interview for more

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.980 align:middle line:90%
information on it.

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually quite
shocking that it's not just

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.250 align:middle line:84%
breast cancer, it's
other chronic diseases

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.320 align:middle line:84%
as well that have been related
to dental amalgam, which

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.400 align:middle line:90%
is off gassing all of the time.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.150 align:middle line:90%
They leak.

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:58.050 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
standard detection,

00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.920 align:middle line:84%
which they want you
to have if you're

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:05.830 align:middle line:84%
with an HMO-- I keep trying
to say HBO-- with an HMO,

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:08.310 align:middle line:84%
they'll want you to go in
once a year for mammography.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Now what do you consider to be
the safest or the wisest form

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of detection?

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well, I think
mammography is overused.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that with
Obamacare coming in,

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:24.640 align:middle line:84%
I think you're going to see less
and less because they're trying

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.940 align:middle line:84%
to save every dollar they
can to pay for the system.

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.847 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
thermography and other?

00:50:30.847 --> 00:50:32.930 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: So they're
going to probably start

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.600 align:middle line:90%
instead of 40, probably at 45.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.170 align:middle line:84%
They're going to figure
when you reach 65 or 70,

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:40.050 align:middle line:90%
you don't need it anymore.

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:43.720 align:middle line:84%
In other words, they've already
shut off women now over 70,

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:47.450 align:middle line:84%
saying that mammography is at
the discretion or the payment

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:49.540 align:middle line:90%
of the patient themselves.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.459 align:middle line:84%
The system won't
pay for it anymore.

00:50:51.459 --> 00:50:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So we see the direction
that's taking.

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:55.123 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: We
see that direction.

00:50:55.123 --> 00:51:00.470 align:middle line:84%
I think thermography is really
the safest diagnostic modality,

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.950 align:middle line:84%
if you have a good one,
you can trust the person

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:08.140 align:middle line:84%
who's running the thermography
unit because it does take

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.860 align:middle line:84%
certain expertise to be able
to interpret thermograms.

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.580 align:middle line:90%
They're not easy to interpret.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.620 align:middle line:90%
MRI, I think, is very good also.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.150 align:middle line:84%
It's more expensive than
mammography, though.

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But it gives you more
answers, it gives you

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:26.340 align:middle line:84%
more precise answers, and
it delivers no radiation.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But is it
covered by insurance

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.130 align:middle line:84%
or do you have to
pay out of pocket?

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:31.796 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Sometimes if you
have a breast cancer it can be.

00:51:31.796 --> 00:51:34.610 align:middle line:90%
But for screening purposes, no.

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:36.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not covered for screening.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And then I think if
I may, Regina, we

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.710 align:middle line:84%
can get into one
of my pet peeves

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:42.210 align:middle line:90%
is that's overtesting with--

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.205 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I was
just going to ask you.

00:51:43.205 --> 00:51:43.450 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:45.075 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
-radiologic procedures.

00:51:45.075 --> 00:51:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And I feel so
strongly about this

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:52.520 align:middle line:84%
that conventional oncology, as
well as children's oncology,

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:57.590 align:middle line:84%
overuse the use of diagnostic
radiologic procedures

00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:01.220 align:middle line:84%
that deliver enormous amounts
of radiation to the body.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And remember your immune systems
are all B and T cell derived,

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:06.500 align:middle line:90%
lymphocyte derived.

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.680 align:middle line:84%
They're most exquisitely
sensitive to radiation.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you're getting
600 times the dose--

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.410 align:middle line:84%
remember a CAT CT scan is
600 times the radiation

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:19.130 align:middle line:84%
of a plain and
simple chest x-ray.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:22.570 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself lining up for
a chest x-ray 600 times in a row

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and you wondering if you're
getting too much radiation.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.610 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens
with one single test.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.296 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:52:28.296 --> 00:52:28.640 align:middle line:90%
600 times.

00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.140 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: So
think about that.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Think of what that's doing
to your immune fighters that

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.590 align:middle line:84%
are being just
bombarded with radiation

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:41.165 align:middle line:84%
particles when they should be
helping you fight your cancer.

00:52:41.165 --> 00:52:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:42.290 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:43.652 align:middle line:90%
What about PET scans?

00:52:43.652 --> 00:52:46.670 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
PET scans are the worst.

00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.560 align:middle line:84%
There are a
radioactive material,

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.540 align:middle line:84%
which is a sugar derived
radio-tagged material injected

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.760 align:middle line:90%
in your vein.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:58.930 align:middle line:84%
That is worse than a CAT
scan by a figure of 5.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's five times
stronger than a CAT scan,

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.139 align:middle line:84%
say, of your chest
or your abdomen.

00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Goodness.

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:06.386 align:middle line:90%
So, avoid them.

00:53:06.386 --> 00:53:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Avoid them.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:09.760 align:middle line:84%
They're really not
that helpful to you.

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.600 align:middle line:84%
You can find out the same
things from tumor markers

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.620 align:middle line:90%
on your blood.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:21.110 align:middle line:84%
MRIs of the chest, the abdomen,
the back, the extremities

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:22.740 align:middle line:90%
work fine.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:26.415 align:middle line:84%
Most radiologists don't like
to give MRIs of the chest

00:53:26.415 --> 00:53:28.790 align:middle line:84%
and abdomen because there
are moving structures

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:32.150 align:middle line:84%
within those bodies
in your anatomy.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The breathing, the
lungs are still moving,

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.210 align:middle line:90%
the peristalsis is still moving.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:40.670 align:middle line:84%
But still, you're going to
get a pretty good answer.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And besides, you're not
going to get any radiation.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:46.050 align:middle line:90%
And then you can do ultrasounds.

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:49.960 align:middle line:84%
You can do thermography in
other parts of the body.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do these very,
very high radiation producing

00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:55.799 align:middle line:90%
testing.

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.965 align:middle line:84%
And especially if you're
on an experimental protocol

00:53:57.965 --> 00:54:00.920 align:middle line:84%
at a university, they require
you every three months

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:01.800 align:middle line:90%
to have a PET scan.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, goodness.

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Avoid that.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:04.810 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Avoid that.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: All right, good.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.570 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to know about that.

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:08.611 align:middle line:84%
Now I'd like to talk about
supplements, including

00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:12.230 align:middle line:84%
some-- one just kind of
disappeared it seems,

00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that went into
obscurity, which was

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:19.390 align:middle line:84%
the whole trend toward using
Laetrile, B17, years ago.

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:21.240 align:middle line:90%
What happened to Laetrile?

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.270 align:middle line:90%
Was it not effective?

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:25.250 align:middle line:90%
Why was it removed?

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Or has it been removed?

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.290 align:middle line:90%
You don't hear about it anymore.

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:28.998 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: There
are only two states

00:54:28.998 --> 00:54:31.100 align:middle line:84%
that I'm aware of
that allow Laetrile.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.600 align:middle line:90%
Nevada is one.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:34.395 align:middle line:90%
Oklahoma is the second one.

00:54:34.395 --> 00:54:34.895 align:middle line:90%
However--

00:54:34.895 --> 00:54:36.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you use Laetrile?

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.790 align:middle line:90%
B17?

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:38.480 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
Here's the caveat.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.660 align:middle line:84%
It has to be manufactured
in the state for us

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.340 align:middle line:90%
to use it in Nevada.

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.320 align:middle line:84%
There is no manufacturing site
for Laetrile in the state.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:47.940 align:middle line:84%
Now let me tell
you this, though.

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.590 align:middle line:84%
The chemo sensitivity
testing that we do

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:54.550 align:middle line:84%
does light up Laetrile if
it's effective for you.

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So we can get it
through the internet.

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:58.520 align:middle line:90%
We can get it through Mexico.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We could have it
delivered to the patient.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:05.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not necessarily
involved in its transfer.

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:07.700 align:middle line:84%
So it's between the patient
and the distributor.

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.699 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But it still
can be effective?

00:55:09.699 --> 00:55:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: It can be, yes.

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Because Laetrile
blocks the uptake

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.310 align:middle line:90%
of sugar in the cancer cell.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And cancer cells thrive on sugar
and they do it anaerobically.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.680 align:middle line:84%
The Laetrile blocks
that mechanism.

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:23.760 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.130 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:25.921 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to just get
into that because it's

00:55:25.921 --> 00:55:28.240 align:middle line:84%
one of those things that
came up and disappeared.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like Taxol.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.680 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
now what a person

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:37.490 align:middle line:84%
can do on a preventative level
in terms of supplementation.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe even a little
lesser known, more

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.380 align:middle line:90%
exotic supplementation.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.940 align:middle line:84%
We already talked about
things like alkalizing,

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and the BioMat, and the
cruciferous vegetables,

00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:49.860 align:middle line:84%
let's talk about it from more
of a supplemental point of view.

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:50.730 align:middle line:90%
What's out there?

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:51.330 align:middle line:90%
What's new?

00:55:51.330 --> 00:55:51.910 align:middle line:90%
What's old?

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:55.300 align:middle line:84%
What works to keep
our body basically

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.430 align:middle line:90%
in a cancer free state, ideally.

00:55:58.430 --> 00:56:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
of course, that answer

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.160 align:middle line:84%
is going to be answered
many different ways

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.510 align:middle line:84%
by different
alternative doctors.

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:08.010 align:middle line:90%
I have my favorites, of course.

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:11.020 align:middle line:84%
But, again, the
beauty of this test

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.360 align:middle line:84%
is, Regina, that we're
going to find out

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.710 align:middle line:90%
what works for that patient.

00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're just
talking about prevention--

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.536 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, just
prevention only.

00:56:17.536 --> 00:56:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: -a
normal person and you

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.540 align:middle line:84%
have maybe cancer in
your family and you say,

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't want ever
to have to deal

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.520 align:middle line:84%
with that, what
should I be taking.

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I have lists in my book that
I will refer patients to.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But things like Laetrile we
don't use prophylactically

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:40.410 align:middle line:84%
just because there is too many
red flags, so I don't prescribe

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:41.850 align:middle line:90%
that in my office.

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:46.020 align:middle line:84%
However, things like
Resveratrol is good.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.180 align:middle line:90%
Colostrum is good.

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.110 align:middle line:90%
First Mother's Milk is good.

00:56:49.110 --> 00:56:54.670 align:middle line:84%
I like vitamins A,
E C and vitamin D3.

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Those are probably the
best anticancer vitamins.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:02.160 align:middle line:84%
There's Inositol , IP-6, which
builds natural killer cells.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Inositol.

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:04.385 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
IP-6 it's called.

00:57:04.385 --> 00:57:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:11.240 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole list of other
things like green tea extract.

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.719 align:middle line:84%
There's Essiac tea,
or ET we call it.

00:57:13.719 --> 00:57:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: I was
reading in your book.

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:18.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that,
that Essiac was just

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:19.802 align:middle line:90%
Caisse, what was her name?

00:57:19.802 --> 00:57:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Caisse.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Caisse's name
spelled backwards and that

00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:25.050 align:middle line:90%
that's what Flor-Essence is.

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll see
Flor-Essence, an old remedy,

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.300 align:middle line:90%
I think produced by Flora.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.780 align:middle line:84%
You'll see it in
health food stores

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and it just kind of sits on a
shelf and I'd walk passed it.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:37.682 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about Essiac
and Flor-Essence for a moment.

00:57:37.682 --> 00:57:38.890 align:middle line:90%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Flor-Essence.

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:40.280 align:middle line:90%
They're both the same thing.

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And they're both
a group of herbs.

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:47.550 align:middle line:84%
What happened was Nurse Caisse
in Canada was on a ward.

00:57:47.550 --> 00:57:48.550 align:middle line:90%
She was in her late 20s.

00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:51.920 align:middle line:84%
She was attending a lady
who was in her late 60s,

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.850 align:middle line:84%
and saw on her
chest wall evidence

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.730 align:middle line:90%
that she'd had breast cancer.

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:59.710 align:middle line:84%
She had a deformity
there, scars and obviously

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.137 align:middle line:90%
had a bad breast cancer there.

00:58:01.137 --> 00:58:03.220 align:middle line:84%
So she questioned her about
it and she said, well,

00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.350 align:middle line:84%
the French Canadian Indians
brewed up this group of herbs

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.350 align:middle line:84%
for me and I took
it for a while.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And, lo and behold,
within six months

00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.470 align:middle line:90%
my breast cancer went away.

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've
never had a recurrence.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:22.070 align:middle line:84%
So Nurse Caisse, at the time,
spent her life actually trying

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to find these herbs
and reformulate them,

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:30.472 align:middle line:84%
distribute them, and finally got
together a whole group of herbs

00:58:30.472 --> 00:58:31.930 align:middle line:84%
and they're all
listed in the book,

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:34.750 align:middle line:90%
but things like sheep sorrel.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that when she
died, they went to her house

00:58:41.350 --> 00:58:42.870 align:middle line:90%
and burned everything.

00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:45.652 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, geez.

00:58:45.652 --> 00:58:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: But the
horse was out of the barn

00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:48.600 align:middle line:84%
because she had
already published.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:50.683 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to laugh
because it's so awful.

00:58:50.683 --> 00:58:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So the point is you can still
get Essiac tea or Flor-Essence

00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.600 align:middle line:84%
as the herbal tincture, and
all of these other things

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.630 align:middle line:84%
really quite easily,
as you mentioned.

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And so for anyone that
needs to be reminded again

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.180 align:middle line:84%
to go back and watch this
part of the interview

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.310 align:middle line:84%
with a pen and pencil,
write it all down.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:07.690 align:middle line:90%
It's also in your book.

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful book.

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Take Control Of Your Cancer.

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, this
is written really

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:15.705 align:middle line:84%
for the lay person in such a
way that anyone can understand

00:59:15.705 --> 00:59:17.250 align:middle line:90%
and you've done a beautiful job.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And we only have a
minute left, what

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:21.020 align:middle line:90%
is your new book coming out?

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.800 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: My new book is
called the Forsythe Anti-Cancer

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Diet Book, and
I've tried to give

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:28.960 align:middle line:84%
the whole history
of cancer diets

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and all the confusion
that exists.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:33.115 align:middle line:84%
And we go from the Gerson diet,
the Budwig diet, the Atkins

00:59:33.115 --> 00:59:33.615 align:middle line:90%
diet--

00:59:33.615 --> 00:59:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, fabulous.

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.738 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE:
Mediterranean diet.

00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:38.740 align:middle line:84%
And there are many good
recipes in the book as well,

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:42.110 align:middle line:84%
but we just tried to clear
the waters because it's

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:43.482 align:middle line:90%
such a muddled area right now.

00:59:43.482 --> 00:59:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very confused area.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for all
the clarity you bring.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.250 align:middle line:84%
And also, I wanted to
thank you for just having

00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:53.610 align:middle line:84%
the courage of a
Vietnam vet to keep

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:56.560 align:middle line:84%
going out there and fighting
for the rights of other doctors

00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:59.460 align:middle line:84%
so that the rest of us can
have the advantage of all

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:01.540 align:middle line:84%
of these beautiful
integrated medicines

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.760 align:middle line:84%
that have been withheld
from the public for so long.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And on that note,
I want to thank

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.540 align:middle line:84%
you so much for having
us come into your office

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.290 align:middle line:90%
and for your time.

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:09.956 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. FORSYTHE: Well,
thank you, Regina.

01:00:09.956 --> 01:00:10.465 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

01:00:10.465 --> 01:00:12.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If you're
given a cancer diagnosis,

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.850 align:middle line:90%
please do not lose hope.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And do not listen to a diagnosis
that leaves very little hope.

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:18.960 align:middle line:84%
As you've just heard,
there's every reason

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.210 align:middle line:84%
in the world to seek
further options.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.370 align:middle line:84%
If you'd like to connect
with Dr. Forsythe,

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:27.010 align:middle line:84%
you can go to his website
at cancercenter.com.

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:38.834 align:middle line:10%
