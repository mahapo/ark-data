[ Music ]

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:36.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina Meredith: We live
in a time when it's possible

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:38.705 align:middle line:90%
to reverse almost any disease

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.174 align:middle line:84%
without ruining the immune
system in the process

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.776 align:middle line:90%
through invasive treatments.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.745 align:middle line:84%
What's becoming more
evident is that we have

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.013 align:middle line:90%
to begin considering the fact

00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:48.448 align:middle line:84%
that we are bioelectrical
in nature.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.084 align:middle line:84%
If we do not consider
our electromagnetic field

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:54.187 align:middle line:84%
and voltage, we will not
reach our core issues.

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.990 align:middle line:84%
Bryant Meyers has spent
18 years researching all

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.893 align:middle line:84%
of the energy technologies
and aspects of healing,

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.363 align:middle line:84%
which he has chronicled in
his book called, "PEMF --

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.998 align:middle line:90%
The 5th Element of Health."

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.235 align:middle line:84%
He's with us today to help give
us his distilled findings --

00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:09.703 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of distillation.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:12.506 align:middle line:84%
So you are professics --
first -- you are a professor,

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:13.840 align:middle line:90%
first of all, of physics,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.542 align:middle line:84%
so I think that's an important
thing to lay on the table.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.711 align:middle line:90%
So energy is your world.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.478 align:middle line:90%
>> Bryant Meyers: Yes.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.846 align:middle line:90%
And medicine, too.

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:20.747 align:middle line:90%
Energy medicine.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.315 align:middle line:90%
I was --

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- premed
at Georgia Tech,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.484 align:middle line:84%
and I did nutritional
counseling.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
I've always been interested
in health and wellness.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.889 align:middle line:84%
So energy medicine was
kind of a home for me

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:32.158 align:middle line:84%
to combine my passion for
helping people with their health

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.495 align:middle line:84%
and with the energy
technologies, which, as I found,

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.066 align:middle line:84%
the body is primarily a field
of energy and information,

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.868 align:middle line:84%
and then the physical body
is sort of secondary to that.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.303 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's a reflection
of that information.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:44.771 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: It's a reflection
-- yeah, it's all connected.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: This is the big
paradigm shift for people.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And I think just over the
last five years in particular,

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.679 align:middle line:84%
the average person who is
interested in these things,

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.083 align:middle line:84%
which isn't actually the average
person in society as of yet,

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:59.219 align:middle line:84%
but still, there's a
vast number of people

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.723 align:middle line:84%
who have started taking
on the scary notions,

00:02:02.723 --> 00:02:05.492 align:middle line:84%
which is that this actually
isn't physical in nature

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.394 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it on
an atomic level, right?

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:08.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Yeah it's
mostly empty space.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And time
and space doesn't run

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.331 align:middle line:90%
like we thought it did, it's --

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.099 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- not linear.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.601 align:middle line:84%
And so you're -- what
you've done here, I think,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.137 align:middle line:84%
is a beautiful job of
chronicling all the ways

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:21.841 align:middle line:84%
in which we can interface
as a bioelectrical being

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.543 align:middle line:90%
with healing modalities.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Absolutely, yeah.

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:26.213 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So tell us,
first of all, what is PEMF?

00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:27.547 align:middle line:84%
Most people haven't
heard of that.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:28.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.018 align:middle line:84%
I mean, PEMF stands for
pulsed electromagnetic field,

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:32.319 align:middle line:90%
and it's a general word.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.221 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the electromagnetic
spectrum has everything

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:37.024 align:middle line:84%
from radio waves up to
visible light up to x-rays

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:38.658 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:02:38.658 --> 00:02:43.397 align:middle line:84%
But in my book, PEMF, I'm mainly
talking about earth-based PEMF,

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:44.865 align:middle line:84%
which is a lower
-- much lower --

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:47.534 align:middle line:84%
the lower end of the
frequency spectrum,

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.937 align:middle line:84%
and it's the frequencies that
the earth naturally gives us.

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:54.341 align:middle line:84%
So in my book, I talk about
how there's two main pulse

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:55.575 align:middle line:90%
magnetic fields.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:58.045 align:middle line:84%
You have the magnetic field
from the earth itself,

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.213 align:middle line:84%
the geomagnetic field, and
there is a frequency to it.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:02.549 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: You know, if
you look at a compass

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.152 align:middle line:84%
under high magnification,
it does -- it does move.

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just a
big static magnet.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.356 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the
Schumann Resonance which comes

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:13.293 align:middle line:84%
from the ionosphere cavity
which is that 7.83 hertz --

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:15.328 align:middle line:84%
which a lot of people have
kind of heard about --

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:17.464 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- the
Schumann Resonance.

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:18.732 align:middle line:84%
It's like, what's this
-- but, you know --

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, wonderful
experiments have been done

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.270 align:middle line:84%
over the last few
decades on the interface

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.973 align:middle line:84%
with human bioelectrical
functioning, our brains,

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:28.675 align:middle line:90%
our physiology, and so forth --

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:29.643 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:03:29.643 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- in
isolated conditions

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.545 align:middle line:90%
with Schumann frequencies --

00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:33.213 align:middle line:84%
we'll go on to some of
that in a little bit,

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:37.216 align:middle line:84%
so it's been well-documented
what the lack of magnetics --

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:40.454 align:middle line:84%
the effect of lack of magnetics
on our brain and bodies --

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:41.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:42.389 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- is.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, why
are -- why are --

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.692 align:middle line:84%
why have we in the US not
been studying this more?

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.461 align:middle line:84%
Why does it always have
to come out of Russia?

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Everything having to do with
energy medicine seems to come

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.166 align:middle line:84%
out of Russia first, and they've
been very committed to this.

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.267 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:55.469 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's, you know,
our medical system.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.571 align:middle line:84%
In the US, people are
opening up more and more.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:58.905 align:middle line:90%
They're getting frustrated

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.741 align:middle line:84%
with our $3 trillion year
medical system, which just kind

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.411 align:middle line:84%
of focuses on -- again, we've
got great emergency care,

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:06.913 align:middle line:84%
don't get me wrong, for
broken bones and stitches,

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:08.915 align:middle line:84%
but when it comes
to chronic diseases,

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.885 align:middle line:84%
even the medical institution
has said that 70 percent

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.321 align:middle line:90%
of all illnesses, our --

00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.822 align:middle line:84%
or all healthcare costs
are preventable diseases.

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:17.524 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:19.292 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: So the shift

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:21.862 align:middle line:84%
in the US now is more
towards prevention,

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:26.032 align:middle line:84%
and people are opening up to
more natural healing modalities.

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:28.702 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, energy
medicine like PEMF was

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:31.571 align:middle line:84%
on the Dr. Oz show, you know,
energy medicine's been featured

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.407 align:middle line:84%
on Oprah, so people are,
like, getting exposed --

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:36.209 align:middle line:84%
you know, the doctors
that show, you know,

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.145 align:middle line:84%
they're actually starting
to talk about, you know,

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:40.881 align:middle line:84%
energy medicine and some of
these type of modalities.

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Dr. Oz
show specifically talked

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.652 align:middle line:90%
about PEMF for pain relief.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.654 align:middle line:84%
You know, that was the
whole basis, you know,

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.323 align:middle line:84%
and that really helped
educate people on, wow,

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:53.593 align:middle line:84%
there's a natural way to help
relieve pain besides taking,

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:84%
you know, pills that just
basically suppress the symptoms,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.797 align:middle line:90%
don't really fix the problem --

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:59.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.033 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- and they got all
these side effects that you hear

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the commercials --

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.501 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, yeah.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.903 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- you know.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:04.237 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We all have a giggle
at that if you watch television.

00:05:04.237 --> 00:05:08.108 align:middle line:84%
Okay. I would like to put this
in a really large context,

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
because as everyone here
is pretty much on board

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.113 align:middle line:84%
with the notion that there
is an energy component

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.782 align:middle line:84%
to our functioning
and our being,

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:18.218 align:middle line:90%
let's look at the cosmic picture

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:21.454 align:middle line:84%
and how we can even
exist within the cosmos.

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:22.722 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.824 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's -- that's
always been fascinating to me,

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:28.028 align:middle line:84%
you know, and in physics, you
know, even like Stephen Hawking

00:05:28.028 --> 00:05:30.730 align:middle line:84%
and some of these top physicists
ponder these questions,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.798 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that conditions
are fine-tuned

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.302 align:middle line:84%
in this universe
for life, you know.

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:38.405 align:middle line:84%
And this goes back to -- I mean,
this actually boils down to some

00:05:38.405 --> 00:05:40.140 align:middle line:84%
of the fundamental
constants, like the strength

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.443 align:middle line:84%
of the electromagnetic force,
the ratio of the proton

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:45.245 align:middle line:84%
to the electron,
the strong force --

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.913 align:middle line:84%
you know, all the
forces are fine-tuned.

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:48.648 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if they were
just off by a little,

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:51.952 align:middle line:84%
atoms wouldn't even exist, or
everything would exist as helium

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:54.754 align:middle line:84%
or hydrogen, and none of the
hydrogen elements would form.

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:57.991 align:middle line:84%
So it's like -- it's almost
like this bubble universe

00:05:57.991 --> 00:06:01.795 align:middle line:84%
that we're in, you know,
is fine-tuned for life.

00:06:01.795 --> 00:06:02.996 align:middle line:90%
It's an anomaly.

00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:05.365 align:middle line:84%
When you look at just all
the possible universes

00:06:05.365 --> 00:06:08.835 align:middle line:84%
that could exist, it's like
conditions had to be just right.

00:06:08.835 --> 00:06:11.404 align:middle line:84%
And then within the
solar system,

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:15.542 align:middle line:84%
the sun has to be just the right
type of sun, and the planet,

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.778 align:middle line:84%
if it's a hospital planet
-- hospitable planet,

00:06:18.778 --> 00:06:21.281 align:middle line:84%
has to be just the right
distance from the sun, you know,

00:06:21.281 --> 00:06:22.349 align:middle line:90%
called the "Goldilocks zone."

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:22.916 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like --

00:06:22.916 --> 00:06:24.317 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.452 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- not too hot, not
too cold form the -- you know.

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:26.486 align:middle line:90%
So they call it -- actually,

00:06:26.486 --> 00:06:28.154 align:middle line:84%
physicists call it
the Goldilocks zone.

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:31.224 align:middle line:84%
So our planet is in
this exact right zone.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:33.493 align:middle line:84%
We only have one star,
you know, the sun.

00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:35.428 align:middle line:84%
Because if you had two
stars, which have the stars

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:84%
in our universe are
in binary systems --

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.998 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:06:37.998 --> 00:06:39.065 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- you can't
get life from that

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.900 align:middle line:84%
because things get
too hot and too cold.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.137 align:middle line:84%
So we have, at the cosmic
level, the universal level,

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.238 align:middle line:90%
conditions are just right.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.574 align:middle line:84%
At the planet -- at
the solar system level,

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:48.975 align:middle line:90%
things are just right.

00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:52.445 align:middle line:84%
And then, within planet Earth,
our planet, again, is fine-tuned

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.748 align:middle line:84%
for life as far as, you
know, we've evolved

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:57.683 align:middle line:84%
with the oxygen levels and all
the elements needed for life.

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.654 align:middle line:84%
So to me, that's the big picture
is seeing that, you know,

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:03.156 align:middle line:84%
health wise, it's like,
what elements are,

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.324 align:middle line:90%
you know, needed for health?

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:04.891 align:middle line:90%
And --

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.259 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:07.861 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- you know, and
it seems that the universe is

00:07:07.861 --> 00:07:10.797 align:middle line:84%
in our favor to give
us the conditions for life.

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.866 align:middle line:84%
But now that we're here on
this planet that's hospitable

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:16.236 align:middle line:84%
for life, okay, well,
what ideally do we need?

00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:18.838 align:middle line:84%
Well, it turns out what we need
is what the earth gives us,

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:19.973 align:middle line:84%
because we've evolved
on the earth --

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:20.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Duh.

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:21.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- for,
you know -- yeah.

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.575 align:middle line:90%
It -- I mean --

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What a
startling surprise.

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:24.778 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: It's like, ah, yeah.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:25.979 align:middle line:84%
Right. But it's like -- but
people don't realize the food

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.281 align:middle line:84%
that we're eating, the
water that we're drinking,

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.983 align:middle line:84%
the unnatural lights
that we're getting --

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:31.117 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- the stale
air from forced air heat

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:34.354 align:middle line:84%
and air conditioning and
just being in the city air,

00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:36.723 align:middle line:84%
we're really not getting
those essential elements.

00:07:36.723 --> 00:07:38.291 align:middle line:90%
And the earth PEMF in my book,

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:40.527 align:middle line:84%
that's why I call it the
fifth element of health,

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:42.595 align:middle line:84%
we're now finding, is
an essential element,

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:46.299 align:middle line:84%
just like most people know they
need food and water and oxygen

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.268 align:middle line:84%
and sleep, you know,
and sunlight --

00:07:48.268 --> 00:07:50.503 align:middle line:84%
not everybody knows you
need sunlight, but you do --

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:53.039 align:middle line:84%
but there's that fifth element
that people don't realize

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:54.407 align:middle line:84%
that the earth's
magnetism is essential.

00:07:54.407 --> 00:07:55.342 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: We need that pulse.

00:07:55.342 --> 00:07:56.509 align:middle line:90%
We need that magnetism.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, that magnetism.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.878 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:00.714 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, we could really
esoteric on this conversation

00:08:00.714 --> 00:08:02.582 align:middle line:84%
and get out to the
consciousness component

00:08:02.582 --> 00:08:04.351 align:middle line:84%
of how these elements
even combine

00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:05.485 align:middle line:90%
to create whatever it is --

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:06.586 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:07.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- that we
and everything else

00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.789 align:middle line:84%
in this solar system and
cosmos and beyond is.

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:11.157 align:middle line:90%
And we might get to --

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.859 align:middle line:84%
hopefully, we'll get a little
bit to the consciousness --

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:13.993 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: We should, yeah.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:14.761 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- element
on a very personal level

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:16.062 align:middle line:90%
at the very least.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:19.499 align:middle line:84%
But first, we were talking
off camera, and you were --

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.335 align:middle line:84%
we were discussing the fact
when it comes to these elements

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:24.104 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the
periodic table,

00:08:24.104 --> 00:08:28.141 align:middle line:84%
that we are a reflection
of supernova dust.

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:29.843 align:middle line:90%
Not just stardust, but --

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:30.343 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.177 align:middle line:90%
There --

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.178 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- supernova dust.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:32.879 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- actually
is a difference.

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Explain that.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.381 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Because, you know, in
the early primordial universe,

00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:37.717 align:middle line:84%
you know, hydrogen and
helium, you know --

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.953 align:middle line:84%
so basically, 90 percent
of our body is stardust,

00:08:39.953 --> 00:08:42.822 align:middle line:84%
and it's because hydrogen
is not really stardust

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's existed since
the beginning, and helium,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.992 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of lithium.

00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.194 align:middle line:84%
But all the heavier
elements have to come

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:50.530 align:middle line:84%
from the pressure created
from the gravitational forces

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.265 align:middle line:90%
to create nuclear fusion

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:55.668 align:middle line:84%
to create the heavier elements
all the way down to iron.

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So -- and we have
a lot of elements

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.204 align:middle line:90%
in our body know down to iron.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:09:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, we have oxygen
and carbon and, you know --

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.776 align:middle line:84%
there's several elements
between --

00:09:02.776 --> 00:09:06.246 align:middle line:84%
basically, iron is numbered
26 on the periodic table.

00:09:06.246 --> 00:09:08.882 align:middle line:84%
But an interesting thing
happens at iron: When you get

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:11.484 align:middle line:90%
down to iron, all of a sudden,

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:15.388 align:middle line:84%
the nuclear fusion reactions are
no longer exothermic; meaning,

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:18.858 align:middle line:84%
it's not favorable to combine
elements heavier than iron.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.561 align:middle line:84%
So because of the
energy required,

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.197 align:middle line:84%
you only get those
elements heavier than iron

00:09:24.197 --> 00:09:25.565 align:middle line:90%
from a supernova explosion.

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.268 align:middle line:84%
There's really no other
way to create them, I mean,

00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:32.439 align:middle line:84%
as far as in the -- even the
heaviest stars can't do this.

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:35.909 align:middle line:84%
Even those massive giant stars
can only go down to iron.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.143 align:middle line:90%
They need that explosion --

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:37.911 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- that energy

00:09:39.145 --> 00:09:40.413 align:middle line:84%
from that explosion creates
those elements heavier

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:90%
than iron.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.348 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:45.518 align:middle line:84%
We have, you know, I forget
exactly how many, but there's,

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:48.721 align:middle line:84%
you know, at least around 10
or 20 elements in our body

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:52.926 align:middle line:84%
that we really need -- example,
you know, chromium and cobalt

00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:55.462 align:middle line:84%
for B12, and, of course,
we need iron and --

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:56.396 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Copper, zinc.

00:09:56.396 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- you
know, there's --

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.133 align:middle line:84%
yeah, some of those heavier
elements than number 26,

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:00.967 align:middle line:90%
you know, we need those.

00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:03.336 align:middle line:90%
So those are supernova elements.

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:04.938 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, we've
all kind of heard, oh,

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.072 align:middle line:90%
we're made of stardust.

00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:08.007 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're also made of
supernova dust which --

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.543 align:middle line:84%
so we've come from this
big stellar explosion.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:13.847 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, you know,
without getting too --

00:10:13.847 --> 00:10:17.317 align:middle line:84%
I like to talk about, you
know, the sun reference to the,

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:19.953 align:middle line:84%
you know, to savior mythologies
and that kind of thing --

00:10:19.953 --> 00:10:20.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:22.188 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- but the sun has --

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.624 align:middle line:84%
all these stars have given their
life to give us these elements.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.325 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:10:25.325 --> 00:10:26.125 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And if you go --

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:28.795 align:middle line:84%
again, if you go into some
of the ancient teachings,

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.565 align:middle line:84%
the very ancient teachings, it
will say that the suns of all

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:36.769 align:middle line:84%
of the universes of all the
solar systems simply are an

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:43.276 align:middle line:84%
expression of much more divine
creative processes and powers,

00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:47.213 align:middle line:84%
and that's just a small physical
expression of those very things

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:51.784 align:middle line:84%
which have the ability to
create massive, massive projects

00:10:51.784 --> 00:10:52.919 align:middle line:90%
such as solar systems.

00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:53.887 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:54.988 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:10:54.988 --> 00:10:56.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so you
realize that is a --

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:57.156 align:middle line:90%
that is a quality

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:59.425 align:middle line:84%
of intelligence that's
just showing itself

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:02.629 align:middle line:84%
in its densest way as
this life-giving thing.

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:03.463 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:11:03.463 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It's pretty awesome

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.331 align:middle line:84%
when you start looking
at the sun.

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: I know.

00:11:06.266 --> 00:11:07.267 align:middle line:84%
The sun is a -- so
-- but it's --

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:08.668 align:middle line:84%
and it's nice to
reflect that, you know,

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
we're made of this
kind of stardust --

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- you know, like
from suns or supernovas so.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.341 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It is.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.609 align:middle line:84%
And I want to ask you something
that's just maybe slightly off

00:11:16.609 --> 00:11:17.844 align:middle line:90%
topic, but maybe not.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.078 align:middle line:90%
You were talking about iron.

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:22.715 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we -- our blood,
which that is the staff

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:24.484 align:middle line:90%
of life, is iron rich.

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:25.818 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.987 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: But I heard a few
years ago from an individual

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.890 align:middle line:84%
that studies these things, that
we're starting to move more

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.458 align:middle line:90%
into a copper-based blood.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.762 align:middle line:84%
Have you seen any evidence of
that or heard any such thing?

00:11:35.762 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: I haven't really --
I'm not familiar with that --

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.631 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Not yet, okay.

00:11:38.631 --> 00:11:39.966 align:middle line:84%
I just thought I'd
toss it out there.

00:11:39.966 --> 00:11:42.669 align:middle line:84%
But these things are mutable
with consciousness as well,

00:11:42.669 --> 00:11:45.305 align:middle line:84%
and due to the response
to our environment.

00:11:45.305 --> 00:11:47.407 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we are being
bombarded with,

00:11:47.407 --> 00:11:48.841 align:middle line:90%
you know, radiation among --

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:50.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:50.877 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- other things,
which I'm going to talk

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:52.245 align:middle line:90%
about in later shows.

00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are very, very
heavy elements that don't belong

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.150 align:middle line:84%
in the human body, but
Patrick Flanagan was telling me

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.954 align:middle line:84%
that radiation can actually
operate as a superconductor.

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:02.221 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:03.756 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And so it can
actually begin working with DNA

00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:06.326 align:middle line:84%
in a very interesting
new and hopeful way --

00:12:06.326 --> 00:12:07.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.127 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- So not to
be afraid of any of it.

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:08.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.229 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's the key.

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:12.098 align:middle line:84%
And the fear is going to come
up in this story as well.

00:12:12.098 --> 00:12:13.399 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.968 align:middle line:84%
And then iron is also the
basis of magnetite, which --

00:12:14.968 --> 00:12:15.768 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.036 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- of course, is

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.571 align:middle line:84%
like a little biologic
antenna that helps give us --

00:12:18.571 --> 00:12:20.807 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That helps the
birdies find their way home.

00:12:20.807 --> 00:12:21.541 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- you know
-- find their home --

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:22.475 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's right.

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:23.509 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- and
also it tunes us

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.044 align:middle line:84%
into this energy of
this earth energy.

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:28.581 align:middle line:84%
So we -- it actually amplifies
that to -- I mean, several --

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.085 align:middle line:84%
I mean, hundred thousand
fold versus other elements.

00:12:32.085 --> 00:12:34.821 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very conductive
to these fields.

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:35.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.558 align:middle line:84%
What about the notion
-- you were saying here,

00:12:38.558 --> 00:12:41.628 align:middle line:84%
I have it written down, that
life here is really dependent

00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:90%
on an oxygen-rich environment.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.598 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're becoming
oxygen deprived.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:46.265 align:middle line:90%
The planet's --

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:47.266 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.101 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- becoming
oxygen deprived.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.469 align:middle line:90%
So what is your take on that?

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:50.336 align:middle line:90%
How --

00:12:50.336 --> 00:12:51.371 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Well, yeah.

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:52.572 align:middle line:84%
That's another --
you know, there's --

00:12:52.572 --> 00:12:53.606 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Another challenge.

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:54.907 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- one
of the challenges --

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:56.409 align:middle line:84%
all of the elements I talked
about, from food to water,

00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:57.744 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're all getting --

00:12:57.744 --> 00:12:59.912 align:middle line:84%
we're getting challenged on
all levels from the quality

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:02.548 align:middle line:84%
of our food, the quality of our
water, the amount of oxygen.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:06.419 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, we should have
around roughly 20 percent oxygen

00:13:06.419 --> 00:13:09.422 align:middle line:84%
in our atmosphere and about
79 percent or so nitrogen,

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:11.824 align:middle line:84%
and only a little bit of
carbon dioxide in the other.

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
But you go -- I forget
the exact number,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.329 align:middle line:84%
but in downtown large
cities, it drops to something

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:90%
like 13 percent or 14 --

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.365 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I heard it
was around 11 at 12.

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:20.299 align:middle line:90%
I read that --

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.668 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: And if
it gets down --

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:23.636 align:middle line:84%
well, if it gets down that low,
that becomes a crisis point.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.172 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a certain level
where it's called hypoxia,

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.374 align:middle line:84%
where the body's not
getting enough oxygen.

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:31.077 align:middle line:84%
And it definitely
causes some problems.

00:13:31.077 --> 00:13:32.078 align:middle line:90%
Because guess what?

00:13:32.078 --> 00:13:34.981 align:middle line:84%
Oxygen is the main
electron acceptor

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.382 align:middle line:90%
in the Krebs cycle so --

00:13:36.382 --> 00:13:37.583 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's our
primary nutrient.

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.352 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: It's a primary
nutrient to create ATP,

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.788 align:middle line:84%
which is that -- really
that currency for energy

00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:44.223 align:middle line:84%
at the physical --
again, it's a physical level.

00:13:44.223 --> 00:13:45.425 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like a little --

00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:47.527 align:middle line:84%
you know, if it's like a
rechargeable battery, ATP,

00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:49.929 align:middle line:84%
and we need -- we expend
our whole bodyweight

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:53.433 align:middle line:84%
in ATP every day, and it's a
very high-energy phosphate bond

00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:55.168 align:middle line:90%
that gives us life and energy.

00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:58.871 align:middle line:84%
Without oxygen, we revert
to the anaerobic cycle,

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:03.176 align:middle line:84%
which only cranks out like
two ATP molecules per turn,

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.744 align:middle line:90%
where you get 38.

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.646 align:middle line:84%
It's like two miles per
gallon versus, you know,

00:14:06.646 --> 00:14:08.414 align:middle line:90%
38 miles per gallon, you know.

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:12.819 align:middle line:84%
So it's -- that's 19 times more
energy from oxygen, you know --

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.754 align:middle line:90%
"aerobic" means with oxygen.

00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, and most
people aren't breathing either.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.491 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: They're
not breathing, yeah.

00:14:18.491 --> 00:14:19.726 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we're
sitting around all day,

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:21.060 align:middle line:90%
our bodies are inactive

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:24.497 align:middle line:84%
and stagnant pools,
and we don't breathe.

00:14:24.497 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And then we have an
oxygen-deprived environment

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.268 align:middle line:84%
on top of it, which is why
in your book you must --

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:33.106 align:middle line:84%
it must be that you write about,
if you're going to exercise,

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:35.141 align:middle line:90%
get outdoors, get near trees,

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:36.943 align:middle line:84%
get near anything
natural you can find,

00:14:36.943 --> 00:14:38.311 align:middle line:84%
but be outdoors when
you're moving.

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:39.679 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.147 align:middle line:84%
I see people jogging, like,
down on Main Street in the city.

00:14:41.147 --> 00:14:42.415 align:middle line:90%
It's like what?

00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're breathing
all that carbon monoxide.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.652 align:middle line:84%
Which, by the way, carbon
monoxide binds to hemoglobin

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:48.321 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't let go.

00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:49.922 align:middle line:90%
Meaning, your body almost has

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.591 align:middle line:84%
to create new hemoglobin
once that happens.

00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:55.294 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's --
you know, oxygen binds

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.096 align:middle line:84%
to hemoglobin then
releases into the cells.

00:14:57.096 --> 00:14:58.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:14:58.264 --> 00:14:59.532 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Carbon
monoxide doesn't, so, yeah,

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:01.601 align:middle line:84%
you want to get away from
-- you don't want to be --

00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, when you're jogging,
you're really taking a lot

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.739 align:middle line:84%
of the air, so if you're, like,
in New York City, you know,

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:09.575 align:middle line:84%
jogging down -- I've seen
people, like, down main streets,

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.043 align:middle line:84%
like, jogging where
there's all this car --

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:13.379 align:middle line:84%
and you definitely want
to get out in the woods --

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:14.213 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That might -- yes.

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:15.148 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- and breathe in.

00:15:15.148 --> 00:15:16.549 align:middle line:84%
Not only are you
getting, you know,

00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:18.818 align:middle line:84%
less of the carbon monoxide, but
you're getting more -- more --

00:15:18.818 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and all the other
pollutants, too, in the city --

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.054 align:middle line:90%
but you're getting that --

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:24.457 align:middle line:84%
more of that oxygen-rich,
life-giving.

00:15:24.457 --> 00:15:27.226 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
the earth PMFs are using

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:29.228 align:middle line:90%
like a PMF therapy device,

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:31.597 align:middle line:84%
enhances oxygen utilization
and absorption.

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:32.431 align:middle line:90%
So --

00:15:32.431 --> 00:15:32.999 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Which is really --

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: So --

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:35.401 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- again,
that is really key.

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.303 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that you could
even begin to chronicle all

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:40.039 align:middle line:84%
of the chronic diseases
that are a result

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:42.542 align:middle line:84%
of having low oxygen
levels in the blood.

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:43.376 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Well, I
mean, you could --

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I mean, everything.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.411 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: You could --
Dr. Otto Warburg showed

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.313 align:middle line:90%
that low oxygen led to cancer --

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:48.114 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, yeah.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:49.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- and, you know,

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:51.217 align:middle line:84%
we talk about the
cellular voltage aspect,

00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:53.052 align:middle line:84%
there's a connection
with oxygen there, too.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:90%
So -- but --

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.055 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So when you're
talking about the elements

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:57.256 align:middle line:90%
of life, it's a little different

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.991 align:middle line:84%
than when some other
people are talking about it.

00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:03.196 align:middle line:84%
You talk about the elements
of elements, magnetics

00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:05.731 align:middle line:84%
and energy sources, but you
talk about liquid water.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.066 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I don't -- you know,
I read that and I thought,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.202 align:middle line:84%
what do you mean
by "liquid water"?

00:16:09.202 --> 00:16:11.137 align:middle line:84%
Because we naturally
assume that water is liquid.

00:16:11.137 --> 00:16:12.939 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked about
oxygen a bit.

00:16:12.939 --> 00:16:14.473 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about liquid water.

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:16:15.842 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, liquid water, I kind of
emphasized that because the

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.213 align:middle line:84%
of Goldilocks zone and kind
of for conditions to be right

00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
on the planet for life typically
revolves around liquid water,

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.886 align:middle line:84%
or, you know, some
science fiction novels talk

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:29.622 align:middle line:84%
about maybe H2S, you know,
hydrogen, because, you know,

00:16:29.622 --> 00:16:32.124 align:middle line:84%
sulfur's related to oxygen,
so you can have like a --

00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:34.527 align:middle line:84%
maybe some other planet
has a liquid hydro --

00:16:34.527 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, H2S which
is a sulfur-based.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.232 align:middle line:84%
But whatever -- wherever
there's life, though,

00:16:39.232 --> 00:16:41.267 align:middle line:84%
there's probably
something similar to water.

00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:42.602 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:16:42.602 --> 00:16:44.971 align:middle line:84%
Because you need the water
-- you know, everything --

00:16:44.971 --> 00:16:47.707 align:middle line:84%
it kind of ties everything
together in the body.

00:16:47.707 --> 00:16:50.643 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, your body's
70 percent water, and --

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:52.044 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:16:52.044 --> 00:16:53.813 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- most people are
undergoing chronic dehydration.

00:16:53.813 --> 00:16:55.948 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, there's a
book -- great book called,

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.050 align:middle line:84%
"The Body's Many Cries for
Water," which really goes

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.753 align:middle line:84%
through this doctor's
-- it's Batmanghelidj --

00:17:00.753 --> 00:17:02.154 align:middle line:90%
I can never pronounce his name.

00:17:02.154 --> 00:17:05.558 align:middle line:84%
It's this long, long name -- but
he was a doctor that spent time

00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:07.492 align:middle line:84%
in a prison camp, and he
found that he could heal --

00:17:07.492 --> 00:17:09.628 align:middle line:84%
he had nothing to heal
people with but water.

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:11.163 align:middle line:84%
And all he did was
give people water

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:12.131 align:middle line:90%
and their ulcers would go way,

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:13.665 align:middle line:84%
their heart problems
would go away.

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.401 align:middle line:84%
That's all he had,
right, was water.

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:16.769 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:18.738 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So just drinking
more good water, and, you know,

00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:22.375 align:middle line:84%
that means either really good
spring water or like I do

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:23.709 align:middle line:90%
like water ionizers, but --

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:24.676 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes, I have one, too.

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:25.711 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- but you have

00:17:25.711 --> 00:17:27.079 align:middle line:84%
to have good whole
house filtration --

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.281 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:28.915 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- or good
filtration in front of it.

00:17:28.915 --> 00:17:29.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:17:29.982 --> 00:17:31.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Because a
lot of the ionizers,

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:32.418 align:middle line:84%
I don't really trust their
small little filters,

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:34.854 align:middle line:84%
so I still recommend people
get some really good --

00:17:34.854 --> 00:17:37.023 align:middle line:84%
like a whole house type
of filtration system or --

00:17:37.023 --> 00:17:37.657 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: I agree.

00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:38.991 align:middle line:90%
I agree with that.

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:40.426 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: But quality of
water and drinking more water.

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:44.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, ulcers, you know, pains
-- aches and pains, headaches.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:45.932 align:middle line:90%
Headaches are a dehydration --

00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:46.599 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, exactly.

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:47.566 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- issue.

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:49.402 align:middle line:84%
So, you know -- so,
yeah, we need --

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.137 align:middle line:84%
we definitely need
to drink more water.

00:17:51.137 --> 00:17:55.074 align:middle line:84%
And again, you know, relating
back to my book on PMF therapy,

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:57.743 align:middle line:84%
PMF therapy, or magnets
in general,

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.812 align:middle line:84%
lowers the surface
tension of water.

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.347 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you put
water on a magnet --

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:02.481 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.416 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- especially
a pulse magnetic field,

00:18:03.416 --> 00:18:04.917 align:middle line:84%
it will lower the
surface tension,

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:05.952 align:middle line:90%
make the water wetter --

00:18:05.952 --> 00:18:07.153 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:07.153 --> 00:18:08.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- so that
the body can, you know --

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:10.723 align:middle line:84%
so the body can absorb
it better, you know.

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:12.391 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not -- you know,
you want to make sure --

00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:14.493 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you ever drank,
like, some water and you felt

00:18:14.493 --> 00:18:15.928 align:middle line:84%
like it just sit
in your stomach.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:17.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, like bottled
-- a lot of bottled water.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.699 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Some of the cheap
bottled waters, yeah, it --

00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:22.335 align:middle line:84%
but if you get, like, a good
ionized water, a really good --

00:18:22.335 --> 00:18:23.936 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Essentia water and
those kinds of waters --

00:18:23.936 --> 00:18:25.104 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, some of the --

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.305 align:middle line:90%
yeah, you know, some

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:84%
of the really low surface
tension waters, I mean,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.775 align:middle line:84%
they just feel like your
body's absorbing them.

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.578 align:middle line:84%
So you want a good water
that has a, you know,

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:37.049 align:middle line:84%
has the properties of, ideally,
slightly alkaline if possible,

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:38.651 align:middle line:90%
negative ORP if possible.

00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:39.418 align:middle line:90%
I mean, some of those things.

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:40.453 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:18:40.453 --> 00:18:41.654 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: It gets
a little technical,

00:18:41.654 --> 00:18:43.289 align:middle line:84%
but it's basically more
electrons in the water has

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:46.425 align:middle line:84%
like an antioxidant,
energy effect, you know.

00:18:46.425 --> 00:18:48.527 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So why don't we go
-- we have our first chart.

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:49.729 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted
to add one thing --

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:51.097 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:18:51.097 --> 00:18:52.198 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- another thing
you write about in the book is

00:18:52.198 --> 00:18:54.700 align:middle line:84%
that the primary --
the studies have shown

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:59.271 align:middle line:84%
that our primary longevity
factor is good pulmonary health.

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:01.407 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Have that
heart pumping,

00:19:01.407 --> 00:19:02.375 align:middle line:84%
have lots of oxygen
moving through the body --

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:03.743 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:19:03.743 --> 00:19:05.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- which is moving
the waters and evaporation.

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:08.214 align:middle line:84%
It keeps the fluids from being
stagnant pools basically.

00:19:08.214 --> 00:19:09.048 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:10.416 align:middle line:90%
According to one study, I mean,

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:12.585 align:middle line:84%
this was like a longitudinal
study over a large population

00:19:12.585 --> 00:19:14.353 align:middle line:90%
of people over time, they found

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:15.688 align:middle line:84%
that was the number
one indicator

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:18.124 align:middle line:84%
for a long life was vital
capacity, which basically,

00:19:18.124 --> 00:19:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is just saying, how much air
can you breathe in naturally

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.095 align:middle line:84%
without trying to
force it in one breath.

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:24.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:24.997 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So it's
like your lung volume.

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.365 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:27.767 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: You know, and people
that are athletes that are,

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:31.303 align:middle line:84%
you know, typically have a much
deeper -- larger lung volume --

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.638 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:19:32.638 --> 00:19:33.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- they can just
take in more air per breath,

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.409 align:middle line:84%
which means their
breathing rate can go slower,

00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:38.778 align:middle line:84%
their heart rate can go slower,
so that's why you notice people

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:40.012 align:middle line:90%
that are in really good shape,

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:42.681 align:middle line:84%
their resting heart rates
can be, you know, 50 --

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:43.449 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah, very low.

00:19:43.449 --> 00:19:44.517 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- very low.

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:46.786 align:middle line:84%
And you'll notice their
breathing is slow,

00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:47.453 align:middle line:90%
which guess what?

00:19:47.453 --> 00:19:48.821 align:middle line:90%
Relates to the mind.

00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, that slow relaxed
breathing then trains the mind

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.525 align:middle line:90%
into a relaxed state, too.

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:53.726 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So it all --
you know, the breathing --

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.362 align:middle line:84%
you know, we've all
heard this with yoga

00:19:56.362 --> 00:19:58.798 align:middle line:84%
and meditation how breathing can
induce the relaxation response,

00:19:58.798 --> 00:19:59.365 align:middle line:90%
and, of course --

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.199 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- meditation, too.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.804 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, just that overall
lung capacity, will just,

00:20:04.804 --> 00:20:06.372 align:middle line:84%
you know, and ways
to increase it --

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:07.506 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:08.741 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- of course,
are through, you know,

00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:11.477 align:middle line:84%
deep breathing or breathing
techniques, exercise,

00:20:11.477 --> 00:20:13.212 align:middle line:90%
you know, yoga, meditation.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.348 align:middle line:84%
PMF does help with, you know,
absorbing more oxygen as well.

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:19.318 align:middle line:84%
There's certain --
but, yeah, absolutely.

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:20.152 align:middle line:90%
Just, in fact --

00:20:20.152 --> 00:20:21.353 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absorption of oxygen.

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:22.521 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- a simple way
for people to just walk

00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:24.256 align:middle line:84%
for exercise, you don't
even have to do --

00:20:24.256 --> 00:20:26.392 align:middle line:84%
when you go out for a walk
-- again, out in the words

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:29.161 align:middle line:84%
or on the -- you know, away from
pollution -- just do some --

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:30.162 align:middle line:84%
practice some conscious
breathing --

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:30.663 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Deep breathing.

00:20:30.663 --> 00:20:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.398 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- while
you're walking.

00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:33.699 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do when I --

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.834 align:middle line:84%
you know, if I don't do any
rigorous cardio in a day.

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.168 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And it can
be something so simple.

00:20:36.168 --> 00:20:39.672 align:middle line:84%
Many -- many years ago, my
ballet teacher always taught us

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:43.809 align:middle line:84%
when we were really working
out, she said, "Okay, darlings,

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:46.679 align:middle line:84%
breathe in to two" [Sniff
sniff] "and out to two."

00:20:46.679 --> 00:20:47.313 align:middle line:90%
[Sniff sniff]

00:20:47.313 --> 00:20:48.514 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Right.

00:20:48.514 --> 00:20:49.882 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And, you know,
something that simple.

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:51.951 align:middle line:84%
And so even applying that with
running or walking is a form

00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
of conscious breathing without
getting into anything, you know,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.921 align:middle line:90%
too yogic, so to speak.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.056 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:57.056 --> 00:20:58.224 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Let's take a
look at our first image,

00:20:58.224 --> 00:21:00.693 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
we're looking at in terms

00:21:00.693 --> 00:21:02.628 align:middle line:90%
of all the elements of life --

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:03.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:21:03.162 --> 00:21:03.929 align:middle line:90%
I used to --

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.231 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- and health.

00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:06.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- I used to do
nutritional counseling, and,

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:07.766 align:middle line:84%
like, my business card was
literally a picture like this

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.702 align:middle line:84%
where I would tell people,
put the right stuff in

00:21:09.702 --> 00:21:10.736 align:middle line:90%
and take the garbage out.

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.837 align:middle line:90%
So the right --

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:13.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's
look at it over here --

00:21:13.038 --> 00:21:14.373 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So the right
stuff is all the elements.

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:17.776 align:middle line:84%
So we have food, you know,
which is like the element earth.

00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:19.979 align:middle line:84%
I kind of use the classical
system of the elements

00:21:19.979 --> 00:21:21.514 align:middle line:84%
because it gives
a nice metaphor.

00:21:21.514 --> 00:21:22.648 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:24.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Because earth
is like, you know, food.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.417 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's a solid.

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:27.853 align:middle line:84%
And I talk about these elements
as the phases of matter.

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:29.588 align:middle line:84%
Not the elements on
the periodic table.

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:30.789 align:middle line:90%
That's why people say, oh,

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.625 align:middle line:84%
the ancients didn't
understand the elements,

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.895 align:middle line:84%
because we know now there's
92 elements on earth,

00:21:35.895 --> 00:21:38.030 align:middle line:84%
and they're all saying
is only four.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.465 align:middle line:84%
Well, how many states
of matter are there?

00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:42.401 align:middle line:84%
There's four: Solid,
liquid, gas, and plasma.

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.169 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:44.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: So that relates

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.971 align:middle line:84%
to food is earth,
water is liquid --

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:46.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we
just spoke with that.

00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:47.573 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:21:47.573 --> 00:21:48.507 align:middle line:90%
Sunlight is fire.

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:50.009 align:middle line:84%
That's the -- and
then fresh air,

00:21:50.009 --> 00:21:51.477 align:middle line:84%
we just talked about
that, is air.

00:21:51.477 --> 00:21:53.846 align:middle line:84%
And then the fifth element
they talk about, like,

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:56.682 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient systems, even
like in the Greek systems,

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:59.885 align:middle line:84%
more like the mystery schools
that talk about the ether.

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:00.452 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't like --

00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:01.787 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:01.787 --> 00:22:02.922 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- the masses would
only get the four elements

00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:04.523 align:middle line:84%
but then initiates would
get the fifth element.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:07.026 align:middle line:84%
But the ether is like
the cosmic, you know,

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:10.062 align:middle line:84%
the background and, you know, I
kind of relate that in my book

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:12.164 align:middle line:84%
to more of the energetic
component.

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:14.099 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's maybe --
again, maybe a little --

00:22:14.099 --> 00:22:17.069 align:middle line:84%
not quite as a direct connection
as the other four elements,

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:19.471 align:middle line:84%
but I think it makes
sense here on planet Earth

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:21.407 align:middle line:84%
that that fifth element,
you know,

00:22:21.407 --> 00:22:24.910 align:middle line:84%
it's like this infused
magnetic field, is, in a way,

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.980 align:middle line:84%
kind of like the ether or
the background energy that,

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.481 align:middle line:84%
at least for us here
on planet Earth --

00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:32.051 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: That is almost
a carrier of information --

00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:33.319 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, it is.

00:22:33.319 --> 00:22:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- it's a field

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:36.922 align:middle line:84%
in which information
can be exchanged

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:38.257 align:middle line:90%
on all different levels.

00:22:38.257 --> 00:22:39.191 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:39.758 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the Schumann
Resonance --

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:40.826 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:42.027 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- and the
earth frequencies,

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.296 align:middle line:84%
it is like the fundamental
heartbeat of the earth,

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:45.731 align:middle line:90%
and it's -- it is like --

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:49.001 align:middle line:84%
you know, all our cells are
entrained to that frequency.

00:22:49.001 --> 00:22:50.336 align:middle line:90%
So it's very important.

00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:51.904 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then we have
positive thinking, which --

00:22:51.904 --> 00:22:54.173 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Yeah, I just
-- you know, you can --

00:22:54.173 --> 00:22:56.809 align:middle line:84%
I just kind of loosely threw
in some of the higher aspects,

00:22:56.809 --> 00:22:59.878 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
obviously, you really need

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:01.213 align:middle line:90%
to have the right mindset.

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:05.484 align:middle line:84%
Because even the stubborn
medical system knows the placebo

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:08.187 align:middle line:84%
effect is a reality
they can't get around.

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:10.923 align:middle line:84%
And it's because if people
will believe a sugar pill,

00:23:10.923 --> 00:23:14.426 align:middle line:84%
for example, is insulin, even
a diabetic will create --

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:17.563 align:middle line:84%
this has been shown -- a
diabetic will create insulin.

00:23:17.563 --> 00:23:20.032 align:middle line:84%
You know, placebos have
been shown to be, I mean,

00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:22.368 align:middle line:84%
something like almost
60 percent as --

00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:25.437 align:middle line:84%
or 70 percent as strong as
morphine as a painkiller.

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:26.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:23:26.505 --> 00:23:27.906 align:middle line:84%
And we've talked about
that on shows.

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:29.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So we know that the
mind -- so whenever you do --

00:23:29.308 --> 00:23:32.878 align:middle line:84%
enter a natural healing or just
a preventative medicine road,

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:35.547 align:middle line:84%
you have to have the
positive expectation

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:38.017 align:middle line:84%
that the body knows
how to heal itself --

00:23:38.017 --> 00:23:39.385 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:40.386 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- if you give it
all the elements that it needs.

00:23:40.386 --> 00:23:40.919 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:23:40.919 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:90%
And then --

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: And that's
fundamental --

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:43.656 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- prayer
and meditation,

00:23:43.656 --> 00:23:44.490 align:middle line:90%
which is -- that's that --

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:45.457 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers -- yeah, connecting --

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:46.025 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- interface
with beyond.

00:23:46.025 --> 00:23:47.159 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:47.993 align:middle line:84%
It's connecting to the
source, it's connecting

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.228 align:middle line:90%
to the -- you know, whatever --

00:23:49.228 --> 00:23:49.928 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: The largest
field of intelligence and --

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:50.696 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Exactly.

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:51.864 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- possibility.

00:23:51.864 --> 00:23:53.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Consciousness,
that pure awareness,

00:23:53.232 --> 00:23:55.334 align:middle line:84%
that pure consciousness that
-- and it is that connectedness

00:23:55.334 --> 00:23:57.269 align:middle line:84%
that connects all
and the god within

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:59.071 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you
want -- you know --

00:23:59.071 --> 00:24:00.205 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, you
could say, without that,

00:24:00.205 --> 00:24:02.007 align:middle line:90%
none of this is here anyway.

00:24:02.007 --> 00:24:02.775 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:03.909 align:middle line:90%
So that's important, too.

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:06.612 align:middle line:84%
And that, in a way,
is that consciousness

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:08.514 align:middle line:84%
that really creates
all things --

00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:09.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:10.816 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- at the level
-- even in quantum physics,

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:12.217 align:middle line:90%
they've kind of run into that --

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:13.052 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They have.

00:24:13.052 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- that discovery.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.721 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- Bernard Haische
and some of the others,

00:24:15.721 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and certainly most people know
the work of Bruce Lipton just

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:22.061 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the consciousness
affects on the field at large.

00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:22.828 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, yeah.

00:24:22.828 --> 00:24:23.929 align:middle line:90%
I love Bruce Lipton, yeah.

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.297 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:27.199 align:middle line:84%
And we also need to look at
the fact, because we're going

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.768 align:middle line:84%
to be going into PMF and some
of the other technologies

00:24:29.768 --> 00:24:31.270 align:middle line:90%
in a moment, that the earth

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.339 align:middle line:84%
and the brain are
operating essentially

00:24:33.339 --> 00:24:34.840 align:middle line:90%
at the same frequency.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.974 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yes.

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:36.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And we have
another image for that.

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:37.376 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:24:37.376 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:90%
So this is an important image.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.714 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of, in a way,
like, to me, the main --

00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:43.849 align:middle line:84%
this image is the main
metaphor for my book.

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.218 align:middle line:84%
It's the body/mind/earth
connection.

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:49.321 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, in this
image, you'll see this --

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:53.525 align:middle line:84%
like, I just used 0 to 30
hertz just because some

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:56.362 align:middle line:84%
of the studies have shown
this to be the primary range.

00:24:56.362 --> 00:24:59.631 align:middle line:90%
And basically, the human --

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.000 align:middle line:84%
I like to call it the
body/mind/earth connection.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.269 align:middle line:84%
You know, we hear a lot about
the body/mind connection.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:05.971 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's a little
bigger than that.

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And you can even extend
it into the cosmos, too,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:84%
but for all practical purposes,
here on the earth we have --

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.912 align:middle line:84%
again, I talked a little bit
about the earth, the Schumann

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:16.482 align:middle line:84%
and the geomagnetic frequencies
that come from the earth.

00:25:16.482 --> 00:25:18.517 align:middle line:84%
And roughly -- they're
roughly 0 to 30 hertz.

00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:21.053 align:middle line:84%
Again, when you take some
of the lower harmonics

00:25:21.053 --> 00:25:23.789 align:middle line:84%
and there's some other
frequencies that come about.

00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:26.759 align:middle line:84%
And the higher harmonics of the
Schumann, like 14.2 and it goes

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:30.496 align:middle line:84%
up to about 30, and after 30 it
really -- it really tapers off.

00:25:30.496 --> 00:25:34.600 align:middle line:84%
So for all practical purposes,
0 to 30 hertz is the frequency

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.702 align:middle line:84%
of life on this planet,
this particular range.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:38.837 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that is
our general functional --

00:25:38.837 --> 00:25:39.905 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: It's our
functional --

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.039 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- frequency
of our brainwaves.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.141 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- our
brainwaves, and this is --

00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:42.975 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean, when
you get above that,

00:25:42.975 --> 00:25:44.042 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at gamma waves --

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: You're
getting gamma waves --

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.612 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- and Buddhist
monks and so forth.

00:25:46.612 --> 00:25:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But we -- when we're asleep and
awake, we function from 0 to 30.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.448 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, from 0 to 30.

00:25:49.448 --> 00:25:51.016 align:middle line:90%
From low deltas of close to -- -

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:52.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right?

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:52.885 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- you
know, .5, you know;

00:25:52.885 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:90%
high beta goes 15 to 30 hertz.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.821 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: That's right, yeah.

00:25:55.821 --> 00:25:57.189 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So our brain
-- and it's interesting --

00:25:57.189 --> 00:26:00.392 align:middle line:84%
the 7.83, if we were really
tuned to the earth and vibrating

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:03.829 align:middle line:84%
at 7.3 like we really
should be, we would be right

00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:05.664 align:middle line:90%
at the lowest end of alpha.

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:06.331 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:07.399 align:middle line:90%
Which is a really --

00:26:07.399 --> 00:26:08.367 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: We would
be like a deeply --

00:26:08.367 --> 00:26:09.067 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- relaxed,
beautiful --

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:09.635 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- relaxed --

00:26:09.635 --> 00:26:10.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- creative.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.938 align:middle line:84%
When you're in alpha,
you can learn better,

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:13.939 align:middle line:90%
you can create more --

00:26:13.939 --> 00:26:14.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: To meditative
state as well.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.774 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Meditative state.

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:16.809 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In a high
meditative state.

00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:18.177 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:26:18.177 --> 00:26:21.113 align:middle line:84%
So that is the earth -- that
fundamental note of the earth.

00:26:21.113 --> 00:26:23.415 align:middle line:84%
And now, here's another
interesting with the projected.

00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:25.451 align:middle line:84%
And this is based on
what's called SQUID,

00:26:25.451 --> 00:26:27.920 align:middle line:84%
is superconducting quantum
interference device.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.123 align:middle line:84%
It's basically a very sensitive
magnetic field detector.

00:26:31.123 --> 00:26:33.025 align:middle line:84%
We can actually detect
the fields

00:26:33.025 --> 00:26:35.394 align:middle line:84%
around the human body
up to 15 feet away.

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:36.829 align:middle line:84%
Okay. This is --
people don't realize.

00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:38.664 align:middle line:84%
No, that's actually
science now detecting --

00:26:38.664 --> 00:26:40.232 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Constantine
Karakoff's work,

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:42.267 align:middle line:84%
and we can find an interview
with him in the archives

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:43.335 align:middle line:84%
that CMN
would have done.

00:26:43.335 --> 00:26:44.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.272 align:middle line:84%
So what someone like Dr.
Zimmerman and this Dr. Seto

00:26:47.272 --> 00:26:51.376 align:middle line:84%
in Japan found that both the
reiki healers -- because they --

00:26:51.376 --> 00:26:53.212 align:middle line:84%
reiki was good to measure
because they have --

00:26:53.212 --> 00:26:56.548 align:middle line:84%
typically, a reiki master will
have a stronger projection,

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:57.783 align:middle line:90%
so it's easier to detect.

00:26:57.783 --> 00:26:58.984 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:00.786 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: But they would
find that the, oh, wow,

00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:05.057 align:middle line:84%
these reiki healers are actually
emitting 0 to 30 hertz in a --

00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:06.792 align:middle line:84%
but it wasn't just
one frequency.

00:27:06.792 --> 00:27:08.894 align:middle line:84%
It was like scanning
up and down.

00:27:08.894 --> 00:27:11.096 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of like when you're
getting like a reiki healing,

00:27:11.096 --> 00:27:12.898 align:middle line:84%
they're literally
-- they're like --

00:27:12.898 --> 00:27:14.833 align:middle line:90%
they're tapped into the earth.

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.702 align:middle line:84%
They're a channel,
and they're tap --

00:27:16.702 --> 00:27:18.070 align:middle line:90%
and the energy coming

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.639 align:middle line:84%
out of their hands is really
the same type of magnetic energy

00:27:20.639 --> 00:27:23.542 align:middle line:84%
that the earth gives us, but
they're amplifying it, right.

00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:26.612 align:middle line:84%
And the primary frequency that
Zimmerman found was at right

00:27:26.612 --> 00:27:28.514 align:middle line:90%
around 7.83 there was a peak.

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:29.348 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Oh, really?

00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:30.282 align:middle line:90%
That's the primary frequency?

00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:30.983 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Yeah,
there was a peak.

00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:32.251 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Interesting.

00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:33.652 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: And Seto with
Qigong, which is other side --

00:27:33.652 --> 00:27:35.821 align:middle line:84%
a different study, other side of
the planet, same type of device,

00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:38.090 align:middle line:84%
a very sensitive
magnetic field detector,

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.126 align:middle line:84%
found that Qigong masters,
again, really able to harness

00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:43.996 align:middle line:84%
that chi or energy -- you
know, chi or qi or prana,

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:45.831 align:middle line:84%
these are other words
for this subtle energy --

00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:48.934 align:middle line:90%
they found also 0 to 30 hertz.

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:52.938 align:middle line:84%
So they were -- so there's been
verification that it's almost

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:55.374 align:middle line:84%
like -- and to me,
the aha was --

00:27:55.374 --> 00:27:57.009 align:middle line:84%
and then when you go
down in the cells, too,

00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.278 align:middle line:84%
with Siscomb and
Walker at the tissue level,

00:27:59.278 --> 00:28:01.713 align:middle line:84%
and Addy and
Bowan at the cell level,

00:28:01.713 --> 00:28:05.083 align:middle line:84%
that our cells resonate at
0 to 30 hertz, and the peak,

00:28:05.083 --> 00:28:07.653 align:middle line:84%
you know, is around -- their
studies, it's around 13

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:10.622 align:middle line:90%
or 14, but still 0 to 30 --

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:13.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: It's a beautiful kind
of portrait of bio-harmony --

00:28:13.492 --> 00:28:14.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: It's bio harmony --

00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:17.162 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- All things living
on this planet, if we chose not

00:28:17.162 --> 00:28:19.264 align:middle line:84%
to disturb those
patterns, which we do.

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at our
next image, because it's

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.702 align:middle line:84%
about how disturbance
shows itself.

00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:25.504 align:middle line:84%
And this is a map
that shows disease

00:28:25.504 --> 00:28:27.739 align:middle line:84%
and depression in
the United States.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:29.775 align:middle line:84%
And let's talk about
the relevance of that

00:28:29.775 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:84%
to the previous slide that
we were just looking at.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.312 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:34.613 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so when you
look at these charts,

00:28:34.613 --> 00:28:36.348 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like you could
put one on top of the other

00:28:36.348 --> 00:28:38.116 align:middle line:90%
and you get almost the same map.

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:40.819 align:middle line:84%
And actually, the cancer
map is very similar.

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.521 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's some
differences, you know,

00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:44.523 align:middle line:84%
but for the most
part, it's like, gosh,

00:28:44.523 --> 00:28:45.791 align:middle line:90%
what's going on here, you know.

00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like is there some
underlying cause that's maybe

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.661 align:middle line:90%
behind this?

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.964 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're looking at one
disease or this, but obviously,

00:28:51.964 --> 00:28:53.765 align:middle line:84%
there's something -- if all
these diseases are happening

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:55.734 align:middle line:84%
in all the same areas,
there's something more core

00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:56.902 align:middle line:90%
that's happening.

00:28:56.902 --> 00:28:58.003 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And what
have you determined?

00:28:58.003 --> 00:28:59.237 align:middle line:90%
What is more core?

00:28:59.237 --> 00:29:02.608 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: My hypothesis
is just that disconnect

00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:03.675 align:middle line:90%
from all the elements.

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:05.043 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just to -- I
mean, it might be an

00:29:05.043 --> 00:29:07.679 align:middle line:84%
over simplistic view, but
I think just, you know,

00:29:07.679 --> 00:29:10.816 align:middle line:84%
the quality of food, the water,
you know, the -- just the --

00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:13.452 align:middle line:84%
you know, all the elements
we just talked about, and --

00:29:13.452 --> 00:29:16.254 align:middle line:84%
so people are just
disconnected from the earth

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:19.491 align:middle line:84%
and the essential elements
of health, and, you know,

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:21.927 align:middle line:84%
I'm pretty sure some of
these areas, you know,

00:29:21.927 --> 00:29:24.796 align:middle line:84%
like with Mississippi and
Arkansas and they're --

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:28.200 align:middle line:84%
they have an overpopulation
with Medicaid and --

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.568 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: We have
a lot of poverty,

00:29:29.568 --> 00:29:31.136 align:middle line:84%
which is also creating
a lot of --

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:31.903 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- there's
a lot of poverty

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:33.038 align:middle line:90%
and some of those areas --

00:29:33.038 --> 00:29:33.839 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- poor
nutrition and depression.

00:29:33.839 --> 00:29:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- are really --

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:35.874 align:middle line:84%
really get more conventional
medicine maybe

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:36.875 align:middle line:84%
than other parts
of the country --

00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:38.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:29:38.276 --> 00:29:39.344 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- or they're more --
where, you know, some areas --

00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:40.045 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: No.

00:29:40.045 --> 00:29:41.747 align:middle line:90%
It's a fascinating map.

00:29:41.747 --> 00:29:44.349 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, if you look
at it just straight up,

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:46.952 align:middle line:84%
it certainly looks like it's
beneficial to your health

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:49.354 align:middle line:84%
to live in the western
part of the United States.

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:50.322 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:29:50.322 --> 00:29:51.256 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Colorado,
where you live,

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:51.823 align:middle line:84%
is one of the healthiest
states --

00:29:51.823 --> 00:29:52.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:53.825 align:middle line:84%
And I live in Arizona
the rest of the time.

00:29:53.825 --> 00:29:54.426 align:middle line:90%
I commute it.

00:29:54.426 --> 00:29:55.794 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:57.129 align:middle line:84%
Colorado, actually, I think was
the healthiest state of all.

00:29:57.129 --> 00:29:57.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Wow.

00:29:57.829 --> 00:29:58.764 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:29:58.764 --> 00:30:00.132 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Yeah,
but -- but, yeah.

00:30:00.132 --> 00:30:02.734 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, it's -- but to
me, it's like we're looking at,

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:05.904 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Merck manual
which labels diseases.

00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:07.839 align:middle line:84%
I mean, gosh, it's
getting thicker every year.

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.141 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:30:09.141 --> 00:30:10.542 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Label after label
after label for diseases.

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:13.078 align:middle line:84%
But what -- you know, what if
the body knew how to heal itself

00:30:13.078 --> 00:30:14.446 align:middle line:84%
if you just gave it
the right elements

00:30:14.446 --> 00:30:16.248 align:middle line:84%
and then took out
all the toxicity?

00:30:16.248 --> 00:30:18.016 align:middle line:84%
That's why I talk about
putting the right stuff in

00:30:18.016 --> 00:30:19.317 align:middle line:90%
and taking the garbage out.

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:22.521 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, you need help
the body to detox as well.

00:30:22.521 --> 00:30:26.191 align:middle line:84%
But when you can really
reconnect to the earth, again,

00:30:26.191 --> 00:30:29.061 align:middle line:84%
the body has this near
infinite intelligence,

00:30:29.061 --> 00:30:32.664 align:middle line:84%
and when you really understand
how complex the body is

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:33.965 align:middle line:90%
and all that's happening,

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:37.102 align:middle line:84%
like 100 trillion cells
all synchronizing together

00:30:37.102 --> 00:30:40.605 align:middle line:84%
with like 400-plus billion
reactions a second --

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:41.973 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean,
it's an amazing --

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.008 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- you know, how
can you explain with a --

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:44.276 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- bioelectrical
symphony.

00:30:44.276 --> 00:30:45.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- billiard ball type
of chemistry,

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.313 align:middle line:84%
some of these medical
models are just ridiculous.

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:49.147 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like --

00:30:49.147 --> 00:30:50.282 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: It is, and they'll --

00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:51.216 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- two tennis
balls finding each other

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:53.185 align:middle line:84%
in a swimming pool
instantaneously.

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.188 align:middle line:84%
It's like all this
random collision theory

00:30:56.188 --> 00:30:56.855 align:middle line:90%
at the cell level.

00:30:56.855 --> 00:30:57.856 align:middle line:90%
That's ridiculous.

00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.224 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's some truth --

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:02.627 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the enzymes and hormones
do have a role to play, but,

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:06.098 align:middle line:84%
to me, more fundamental is
the body's holographic energy

00:31:06.098 --> 00:31:07.165 align:middle line:90%
and information field.

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:09.234 align:middle line:84%
And when we reconnect
to those elements,

00:31:09.234 --> 00:31:12.471 align:middle line:84%
including the earth
PEMF, you know, we can --

00:31:12.471 --> 00:31:14.172 align:middle line:84%
you know, we can
reverse a lot of --

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:15.340 align:middle line:84%
these are all preventable
diseases.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.041 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:16.875 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:17.943 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: You know, diabetes --

00:31:17.943 --> 00:31:19.611 align:middle line:84%
unless you're born
with Type 1 diabetes --

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:20.479 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: They're all chronic.

00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:21.613 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:31:21.613 --> 00:31:23.448 align:middle line:84%
Most people have adult
onset, though, Type 2.

00:31:23.448 --> 00:31:25.150 align:middle line:90%
That's the most prevalent.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.651 align:middle line:84%
You know, heart disease
is preventable.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:27.953 align:middle line:90%
Cancer's preventable.

00:31:27.953 --> 00:31:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So these are the
least active, least happy,

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.323 align:middle line:84%
most obese, highest
disease of heart --

00:31:31.323 --> 00:31:32.124 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:31:32.124 --> 00:31:32.958 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- and diabetes.

00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:34.059 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: And the least active

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:35.160 align:middle line:84%
and the least happy
shows you the connection

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.028 align:middle line:84%
between depression and
the mind, you know,

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:39.564 align:middle line:84%
when you have negative
outlook, how that relates

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.467 align:middle line:84%
to the diseases; and
when you don't exercise

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:45.704 align:middle line:84%
and when you're not getting that
oxygen, how that relates, too.

00:31:45.704 --> 00:31:47.072 align:middle line:90%
And obesity --

00:31:47.072 --> 00:31:47.873 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:31:47.873 --> 00:31:49.007 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- how obesity --

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:50.041 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So you just
were -- you were just --

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.843 align:middle line:84%
you stopped by a
subject a second ago,

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:55.580 align:middle line:84%
which was about having -- being
out and being with the land

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.083 align:middle line:84%
on the land and the
frequencies of the land itself.

00:31:58.083 --> 00:31:59.684 align:middle line:90%
And I wanted to talk about that.

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:02.554 align:middle line:84%
We -- but there's
another issue going on.

00:32:02.554 --> 00:32:05.023 align:middle line:84%
And that is, even though we
need to be out on the land

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:07.192 align:middle line:84%
and with the earth's
frequencies, the magnetic field

00:32:07.192 --> 00:32:09.895 align:middle line:84%
of the earth itself
has dropped --

00:32:09.895 --> 00:32:10.829 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yes, it has.

00:32:10.829 --> 00:32:12.164 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- hugely.

00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:14.132 align:middle line:84%
Now, Gregg Braden 20 years
ago was writing about this

00:32:14.132 --> 00:32:17.435 align:middle line:84%
in his book "Zero Point," and
that a lot of people like myself

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:20.906 align:middle line:84%
and others were alerted to this
issue and what that might mean.

00:32:20.906 --> 00:32:22.974 align:middle line:90%
And it seems be dropping --

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.576 align:middle line:84%
have dropped even
further since then.

00:32:24.576 --> 00:32:27.512 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at over a 50
percent drop-off, as you say,

00:32:27.512 --> 00:32:30.448 align:middle line:84%
conservatively, over
the last 300 years.

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.349 align:middle line:90%
That's major.

00:32:31.349 --> 00:32:32.617 align:middle line:90%
Our brains, our bodies,

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:34.486 align:middle line:84%
our immune systems
are reliant upon it.

00:32:34.486 --> 00:32:36.888 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the
next image having to do

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.023 align:middle line:90%
with these human frequencies.

00:32:38.023 --> 00:32:38.957 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:42.861 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
-- but -- yeah.

00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:45.664 align:middle line:84%
So the earth's magnetic field
is, like you said, has declined

00:32:45.664 --> 00:32:48.300 align:middle line:84%
by 50 percent the
last 300 years,

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.770 align:middle line:84%
and there's this Dr. Nakagawa
who kind of coined the term

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.672 align:middle line:90%
"magnetic deficiency syndrome."

00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:57.008 align:middle line:84%
And he found that workers,
like, that were in like concrete

00:32:57.008 --> 00:33:00.579 align:middle line:84%
and steel structures that worked
like overtime type of hours,

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:03.215 align:middle line:84%
they would get chronic
pain, depression, you know,

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:05.183 align:middle line:84%
all of these -- you
know, all these problems

00:33:05.183 --> 00:33:07.319 align:middle line:84%
with their physical
and mental health.

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:11.122 align:middle line:84%
And what he found was just by
doing simple magnetic therapy,

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:13.525 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, I think he used
pulse magnetic therapy, too,

00:33:13.525 --> 00:33:15.393 align:middle line:90%
he was able to reverse those.

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.028 align:middle line:84%
Almost like seasonal
affective disorder,

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:18.296 align:middle line:90%
you give somebody bright,

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.031 align:middle line:84%
full-spectrum light
half hour a day,

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.566 align:middle line:84%
the seasonal affective
disorder goes away.

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:22.901 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:24.402 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Same thing with
magnetic deficiency syndrome.

00:33:24.402 --> 00:33:27.472 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, conditions
like fibromyalgia in Japan,

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:28.707 align:middle line:90%
it's like another word

00:33:28.707 --> 00:33:30.642 align:middle line:84%
for fibromyalgia is
magnetic deficiency syndrome.

00:33:30.642 --> 00:33:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Oh, that's
interesting.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: And I have seen
so many people respond

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:36.848 align:middle line:84%
to PEMF therapy that
had fibromyalgia.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.183 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's -- we've got --

00:33:38.183 --> 00:33:40.418 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Fibromyalgia, I
did another interview on that,

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:43.154 align:middle line:84%
is almost like a garbage
bucket diagnosis of things

00:33:43.154 --> 00:33:44.923 align:middle line:84%
that just chronically
are inflamed and hurt --

00:33:44.923 --> 00:33:45.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, exactly.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.558 align:middle line:90%
That's a good word for it.

00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:47.893 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: -- you know.

00:33:47.893 --> 00:33:50.028 align:middle line:84%
And so you were talking chronic
inflammation in the body.

00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:50.662 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:33:50.662 --> 00:33:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.431 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: But it's that --
again, when you don't get enough

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:55.333 align:middle line:84%
of these earth fields, you start
to feel pain all over your body.

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:57.903 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the --
one of the aspects so --

00:33:57.903 --> 00:33:59.137 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: What about
Dr. Valerie Hunt

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:00.405 align:middle line:90%
and the work she did?

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:01.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:02.607 align:middle line:90%
She did some zero field studies.

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:04.776 align:middle line:84%
So there's actually a lot of
evidence to show that we need --

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.011 align:middle line:90%
some people would say, well,

00:34:06.011 --> 00:34:07.545 align:middle line:84%
so what that the earth's
magnetic field has declined

00:34:07.545 --> 00:34:08.280 align:middle line:90%
by 50 percent?

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.114 align:middle line:90%
Well --

00:34:09.114 --> 00:34:10.447 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: What's the big deal?

00:34:10.447 --> 00:34:11.449 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- when you --
well, not everybody understands

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.650 align:middle line:84%
that we need the
earth's magnetic field,

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.386 align:middle line:90%
that it's an essential element.

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:17.188 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, NASA -- even
before Valerie Hunt, you know,

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:19.824 align:middle line:84%
the Russian space program
and NASA figured out that

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:21.826 align:middle line:84%
when you send an
astronaut into space,

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:23.328 align:middle line:84%
you have to have a
Schumann Resonance --

00:34:23.328 --> 00:34:24.829 align:middle line:90%
a Schumann generator.

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:27.465 align:middle line:84%
You know, Yuri Gagarin came
back after two hours -- what?

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:30.835 align:middle line:84%
-- one hour and 48 minute flight
in space, and he was, you know,

00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:33.972 align:middle line:84%
just from an hour and 48 minutes
outside of the Earth's field,

00:34:33.972 --> 00:34:36.775 align:middle line:84%
was disoriented, had
some problems, you know.

00:34:36.775 --> 00:34:38.176 align:middle line:84%
So they figured that
out early on.

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:40.946 align:middle line:84%
Valerie Hunt did some really
good studies, kind of --

00:34:40.946 --> 00:34:42.880 align:middle line:84%
because some people might
say, well, out in space,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.815 align:middle line:84%
there might be more radiation
that caused their problem.

00:34:44.815 --> 00:34:49.621 align:middle line:84%
So Valerie Hunt did a study in
what's called a mu-steel chamber

00:34:49.621 --> 00:34:51.856 align:middle line:84%
which totally blocks
out the Earth's field.

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:54.592 align:middle line:84%
It's actually harder than you
think to get in the zero field.

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:55.994 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:34:55.994 --> 00:34:57.329 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Even when you're in
concrete and steel, you still --

00:34:57.329 --> 00:34:58.997 align:middle line:84%
it's like you can still get
your cell phone reception a

00:34:58.997 --> 00:34:59.831 align:middle line:90%
little bit.

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:00.966 align:middle line:90%
I mean, sometimes it gets down.

00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:03.301 align:middle line:84%
But the Earth's field's
always kind of there.

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:05.003 align:middle line:90%
But this mu-steel, it blocked --

00:35:05.003 --> 00:35:06.871 align:middle line:84%
it really blocks
out all field so --

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:07.939 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And her
findings were?

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:09.207 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: And her
findings were that --

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:11.776 align:middle line:84%
she used, like, healthy
college students, you know --

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:16.614 align:middle line:84%
that they would experience
increased sensations of pain;

00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:18.450 align:middle line:84%
they would experience
disorientation,

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:21.152 align:middle line:84%
almost like they didn't know
what was up and what was down;

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:23.521 align:middle line:84%
in, like, the learning studies,
they couldn't think clearly.

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:26.324 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't, like,
grasp concepts as well;

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:29.027 align:middle line:84%
they basically just
couldn't learn information.

00:35:29.027 --> 00:35:31.763 align:middle line:84%
And depression; some of
them would start crying

00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:33.465 align:middle line:90%
uncontrollably, you know.

00:35:33.465 --> 00:35:37.202 align:middle line:84%
So -- so this relates to
some of the benefits of PEMF.

00:35:37.202 --> 00:35:40.038 align:middle line:84%
To me, it's like the main
benefits, like pain relief and,

00:35:40.038 --> 00:35:42.741 align:middle line:84%
you know, all these --
oh, and the tense --

00:35:42.741 --> 00:35:44.476 align:middle line:84%
like, the body'd become
more tense.

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:46.111 align:middle line:90%
It would be hard to be relaxed.

00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:47.779 align:middle line:90%
You'd be, like, all tensed up.

00:35:47.779 --> 00:35:50.515 align:middle line:84%
So some of the main benefits
of PMFR, like pain relief

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.083 align:middle line:90%
and healing regeneration --

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:54.185 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, the mind part,
just the mental part alone,

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:57.922 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people are -- this is
showing up in our lives en masse

00:35:57.922 --> 00:36:00.859 align:middle line:90%
by having kind of mental fog,

00:36:00.859 --> 00:36:02.994 align:middle line:84%
issues with short-term
memory at all ages.

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:05.497 align:middle line:84%
It's not just, you
know, Alzheimer's

00:36:05.497 --> 00:36:07.832 align:middle line:90%
and such anymore or dementia.

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:10.802 align:middle line:84%
And the mind must have
a proper magnetic field.

00:36:10.802 --> 00:36:12.203 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, absolutely.

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:14.072 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And what I want to
do is start talking about some

00:36:14.072 --> 00:36:15.473 align:middle line:90%
of the various technologies.

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:18.309 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been exploring all
these for many years as well.

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.512 align:middle line:84%
You've gone far deeper
into them than I have.

00:36:20.512 --> 00:36:22.080 align:middle line:90%
But I started initially playing

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.916 align:middle line:84%
with a little device
called the BioPro,

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:28.987 align:middle line:84%
which actually does have a nice
little subtle sustaining effect

00:36:28.987 --> 00:36:29.921 align:middle line:90%
on the body.

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:31.256 align:middle line:90%
And so let's start from --

00:36:31.256 --> 00:36:33.825 align:middle line:84%
with that, the tiniest and
most subtle of these effects.

00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:35.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyer: Yeah, I mean --

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.528 align:middle line:84%
so there's all kinds of energy
healing devices out there.

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:38.897 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the ones that I
like the best are the ones

00:36:38.897 --> 00:36:41.499 align:middle line:84%
that are most closely aligned
to what the Earth is giving us

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:45.036 align:middle line:84%
as far as frequency, and
something like the BioPro can --

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:47.505 align:middle line:84%
or those EMF protection
type of devices, you know,

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:48.907 align:middle line:90%
the Q-Link and there's others --

00:36:48.907 --> 00:36:49.674 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:51.543 align:middle line:90%
GIA, they're all the same.

00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:52.944 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- yeah,
they help the --

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:54.979 align:middle line:84%
you know, they help to sort of
negate some of the electrosmog,

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:56.881 align:middle line:84%
some of the negative
electricity.

00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:58.349 align:middle line:84%
And then, you know, they
can, to a subtle degree,

00:36:58.349 --> 00:37:00.885 align:middle line:84%
kind of enhance your
biofield and have a kind

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:02.087 align:middle line:90%
of subtle effect there.

00:37:02.087 --> 00:37:03.321 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's
just a tiny little device.

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:04.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: That's a
tiny little device --

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:05.657 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And then there
are other devices that --

00:37:05.657 --> 00:37:08.126 align:middle line:84%
there have been --
skeenar devices,

00:37:08.126 --> 00:37:10.095 align:middle line:90%
for example, used with healing.

00:37:10.095 --> 00:37:12.297 align:middle line:90%
One of my favorites has been,

00:37:12.297 --> 00:37:14.032 align:middle line:84%
up to this point I've
always loved the BioMat.

00:37:14.032 --> 00:37:16.334 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Yeah, the BioMat from
like -- yeah, that's like a,

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:18.369 align:middle line:84%
you know, an amethyst-type
of -- it's --

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.405 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's good
for circulation.

00:37:20.405 --> 00:37:23.408 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I honestly like the PMF
technologies a little bit better

00:37:23.408 --> 00:37:25.510 align:middle line:84%
because they do a lot
more, but something

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.079 align:middle line:84%
like the BioMat is nice for
circulation, and it's --

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.447 align:middle line:90%
there's no -- and it's --

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:30.648 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Negative ions, far
infrared light, you know --

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:31.916 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Negative ions,
there's far infrared,

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:33.518 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't give you
any of the electrosmog.

00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:36.754 align:middle line:84%
Like, a heating pad, for
example, causes a lot more harm

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:38.423 align:middle line:84%
than good because
you're getting that --

00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:40.925 align:middle line:84%
that 60 hertz unhealthy
frequency --

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:43.528 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I have you been
sleeping on a BioMat for six

00:37:43.528 --> 00:37:45.797 align:middle line:84%
or seven years, and I'll tell
you, if I'm feeling a little

00:37:45.797 --> 00:37:49.968 align:middle line:84%
down or my batteries are low,
boom, I'm immediately recharged.

00:37:49.968 --> 00:37:51.436 align:middle line:90%
And that's a real key here.

00:37:51.436 --> 00:37:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, let's talk about batteries.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.241 align:middle line:84%
We have another image
regarding cells and batteries

00:37:56.241 --> 00:37:57.308 align:middle line:84%
and the similarity
between the two.

00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:58.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:37:58.243 --> 00:37:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is --
this is important.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.145 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So let's
take a look at this

00:38:00.145 --> 00:38:00.745 align:middle line:90%
and explain what we're seeing.

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:02.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:38:02.113 --> 00:38:04.182 align:middle line:84%
So basically, you know, the
word "cell" is so appropriate

00:38:04.182 --> 00:38:06.951 align:middle line:84%
because a battery cell, you
hear a well cell battery.

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.887 align:middle line:84%
You know, people say, "I got
to recharge my batteries."

00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:10.889 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, they've
got to recharge their cells.

00:38:10.889 --> 00:38:13.358 align:middle line:84%
Because cells are batteries
and batteries are cells.

00:38:13.358 --> 00:38:14.192 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:38:14.192 --> 00:38:15.393 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: So our little cell --

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.729 align:middle line:84%
we've got about 100
trillion cells in our body,

00:38:17.729 --> 00:38:20.331 align:middle line:84%
and a healthy cell should
have around 70 millivolts

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:22.934 align:middle line:90%
up to 100 millivolts of voltage.

00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:24.302 align:middle line:84%
Now, that doesn't
sound like much.

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:27.405 align:middle line:84%
But when you consider
how small a cell is,

00:38:27.405 --> 00:38:29.440 align:middle line:84%
they're incredibly
energetic for their size.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they'll hold like
10 million volts per meter

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.978 align:middle line:84%
across that tiny
little cell membrane.

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:34.812 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Just amazing.

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: I mean there's no --

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.048 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if there's
any capa --

00:38:37.048 --> 00:38:38.550 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's some capacitors
now that can do that,

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.219 align:middle line:84%
but it's a tremendous
amount of energy.

00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:44.322 align:middle line:84%
And that -- and that --
so that cellular charge,

00:38:44.322 --> 00:38:47.325 align:middle line:84%
that charge separation
of that voltage, gives --

00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:51.229 align:middle line:84%
you know, is a way -- that
actually powers the cell.

00:38:51.229 --> 00:38:53.231 align:middle line:84%
You know, the cells have
two main backup battery --

00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:54.599 align:middle line:90%
two battery sources.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:59.437 align:middle line:84%
One is ATP, and the other is
TMP, or transmembrane potential,

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and that's what gives rise
to that 70 millivolts.

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a battery;
the cells of storing energy

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.078 align:middle line:90%
across the cell membrane.

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:08.346 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: And that energy
is used for ion transport.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.216 align:middle line:84%
It's used for all
kinds of things.

00:39:11.216 --> 00:39:12.784 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a backup
power source for --

00:39:12.784 --> 00:39:14.285 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Your whole
neurological system.

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:15.887 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- your
ATP production, yeah.

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:19.557 align:middle line:84%
So what Dr. Otto Warburg found,
you know, he's well-known.

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.759 align:middle line:84%
He's actually a Noble
prize winner.

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.795 align:middle line:84%
Well, some people have heard
of him with his connection

00:39:23.795 --> 00:39:25.430 align:middle line:90%
with lack of oxygen and cancer.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, what he found, too, was
a connection with voltage.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.336 align:middle line:84%
He found that people that
had a healthy voltage,

00:39:31.336 --> 00:39:33.905 align:middle line:84%
like around 70 millivolts,
you're not going to get sick

00:39:33.905 --> 00:39:36.174 align:middle line:90%
if your cells are fully charged.

00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:37.809 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like
the green light is

00:39:37.809 --> 00:39:40.311 align:middle line:84%
on in the battery charger, and
all your cells are charged.

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:41.579 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, PMF therapy,

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:44.015 align:middle line:84%
that's why I call it a
whole-body battery recharger.

00:39:44.015 --> 00:39:45.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, some of these
devices that help --

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:48.052 align:middle line:84%
that use the natural
earth frequencies

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:49.854 align:middle line:90%
to energize the cells.

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:54.125 align:middle line:84%
Now, as -- you know, as people
get disconnected from the earth

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:57.462 align:middle line:84%
and its elements, eat bad food
and bad water and get, you know,

00:39:57.462 --> 00:40:01.699 align:middle line:84%
unhealthy lighting and lack of
oxygen, the cell voltage starts

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:04.569 align:middle line:84%
to get diminished, and you
start to notice, you know,

00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:06.504 align:middle line:84%
you're not quite as
energetic, and then you get

00:40:06.504 --> 00:40:07.739 align:middle line:84%
to where maybe chronic
illnesses,

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.907 align:middle line:84%
chronic fatigue can set
in or some of these --

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:13.077 align:middle line:84%
you know, you might get sick
or you might become susceptible

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.246 align:middle line:84%
to colds and flus and
that kind of stuff.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:18.349 align:middle line:84%
But if you let it run down too
far, you get in a position --

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:20.351 align:middle line:84%
you get in a cancerous
type of zone

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:23.154 align:middle line:84%
which Dr. Otto Warburg
found was between --

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.356 align:middle line:90%
or 15 and 20 millivolts.

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.758 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:40:26.758 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Now, the interesting
thing is, why is it the heart --

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.361 align:middle line:84%
we don't ever hear
of heart cancer?

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:31.763 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:40:31.763 --> 00:40:34.032 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: It's like -- it does
happen, but it's extremely rare,

00:40:34.032 --> 00:40:35.967 align:middle line:84%
and it's usually with the
outside lining of the heart.

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:37.368 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:40:37.368 --> 00:40:38.603 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: But the reason you
never hear of heart cancer is

00:40:38.603 --> 00:40:41.306 align:middle line:84%
because heart cells are
the most energetic cells.

00:40:41.306 --> 00:40:42.407 align:middle line:90%
We were talking about that --

00:40:42.407 --> 00:40:43.474 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's
a really good point.

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:45.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: The heart
field is that field

00:40:45.743 --> 00:40:47.545 align:middle line:90%
that extends 15 feet into space.

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:48.946 align:middle line:90%
The heart field is the most --

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:52.116 align:middle line:84%
is the strongest field of the
human body measured by science.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:55.853 align:middle line:84%
You know, they can take that
SQUID, magnetic field detector,

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:58.222 align:middle line:84%
and 15 feet away, they're
measuring the heart field.

00:40:58.222 --> 00:41:01.592 align:middle line:84%
You know, the head field is
there, but it's not 15 feet.

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:04.128 align:middle line:84%
The muscles have a
field, you know, also.

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.496 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:08.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So our cells are
little mini batteries, you know,

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:12.670 align:middle line:84%
and again, looking at the body
from an energetic perspective,

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.273 align:middle line:84%
you know, it kind
of makes sense.

00:41:15.273 --> 00:41:16.541 align:middle line:90%
You know, it's like --

00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:17.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Sure.

00:41:17.375 --> 00:41:18.676 align:middle line:90%
It does. Well, no, first of all,

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.745 align:middle line:84%
I think people are probably
wondering, is there a way

00:41:20.745 --> 00:41:23.581 align:middle line:84%
that they can detect
their own millivoltage?

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:26.351 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: That --
I believe what's --

00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:29.220 align:middle line:84%
it's a pretty complicated,
sophisticated type of test

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.722 align:middle line:90%
to measure that, because, again,

00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:32.824 align:middle line:84%
you've got to remember how
small a cell -- I mean, like --

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:34.158 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, you
can probably measure it

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:36.461 align:middle line:84%
by the condition of your health,
and your happiness, right?

00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:37.562 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:41:37.562 --> 00:41:39.263 align:middle line:84%
Like 5000 cells can
fit across an inch,

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:40.865 align:middle line:84%
so that just gives
you a perspective --

00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:41.966 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So we can't
go measure per se,

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.267 align:middle line:84%
but we can measure
it by evidence.

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:44.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, there's --

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:45.536 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: If we're
feeling alive and vibrant

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:47.238 align:middle line:84%
and generally healthy,
we're probably

00:41:47.238 --> 00:41:48.072 align:middle line:90%
up toward the healthy --

00:41:48.072 --> 00:41:49.273 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: There's some good --

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:50.475 align:middle line:84%
you know, like my friend Syria
does gas

00:41:50.475 --> 00:41:51.509 align:middle line:90%
discharge visualization.

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.044 align:middle line:90%
He's very good at it, you know.

00:41:53.044 --> 00:41:56.147 align:middle line:84%
And it's -- it's a more advanced
form of Kirlian photography,

00:41:56.147 --> 00:41:59.984 align:middle line:84%
that you can kind of see
the energy distribution

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:01.819 align:middle line:84%
around the body,
both the symmetry

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.988 align:middle line:84%
and if there's any holes
in, like, the field.

00:42:03.988 --> 00:42:07.291 align:middle line:84%
And so I like -- to me, that
gives a kind of good model

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:08.393 align:middle line:90%
for the three aspects

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.328 align:middle line:84%
of the energy field
to put it in balance.

00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:11.729 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:12.797 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: First, you want the
field to be bright, you know,

00:42:12.797 --> 00:42:14.699 align:middle line:84%
just like -- I mean,
if you've got energy

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:17.068 align:middle line:84%
like a bright flashlight,
the batteries are charged,

00:42:17.068 --> 00:42:18.202 align:middle line:90%
the light's bright, right.

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:20.938 align:middle line:84%
So people that their
eyes are like lit up,

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.540 align:middle line:84%
you can just tell they're
beaming with energy,

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.442 align:middle line:84%
there's like a lightness that
comes out of them, right.

00:42:24.442 --> 00:42:25.576 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:26.778 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: And then you
want the energy to be --

00:42:26.778 --> 00:42:28.780 align:middle line:84%
you don't want the energy
all to be on one side.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.349 align:middle line:84%
You know, have your
left/right brain synchronized

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.051 align:middle line:84%
and also your -- so the
field should be symmetric.

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And then you want it
to be kind of smooth.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:38.890 align:middle line:84%
There shouldn't be any holes,
because when there's holes

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.992 align:middle line:84%
in that field, energy
kind of can leak out.

00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:41.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yes.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:42.527 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:42:42.527 --> 00:42:43.861 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So those
three aspects --

00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:45.229 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: So, again, some
advanced Kirlian devices --

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.631 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Yeah, those advanced
Kirlian devices can kind

00:42:46.631 --> 00:42:48.533 align:middle line:84%
of see that because
some of these tests

00:42:48.533 --> 00:42:51.836 align:middle line:84%
to really measure cell voltage
are just too expensive devices.

00:42:51.836 --> 00:42:52.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Okay.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.738 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about -- I mean,

00:42:53.738 --> 00:42:55.640 align:middle line:84%
I just mentioned a
couple of technologies.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.941 align:middle line:90%
There are lots of them.

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:58.242 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:42:58.242 --> 00:43:00.745 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: I mean, if you
go under energy technologies

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:02.280 align:middle line:84%
for healing and just
Google it, there --

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.214 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: There's a lot.

00:43:03.214 --> 00:43:04.015 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- are
a lot of things.

00:43:04.015 --> 00:43:05.082 align:middle line:90%
You have tried all of them.

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:07.118 align:middle line:84%
I've tried a good
number of them myself,

00:43:07.118 --> 00:43:08.753 align:middle line:84%
and have certain
ones I really like.

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:12.023 align:middle line:84%
I haven't tried the PEMF,
but you ended up settling

00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:14.725 align:middle line:84%
into the PEMF, and it's
one of the more exotic ones

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:17.562 align:middle line:84%
in the terms of, you know, it's
a life-long kind of commitment.

00:43:17.562 --> 00:43:18.229 align:middle line:90%
It cost what?

00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:19.664 align:middle line:90%
$3,000 or so.

00:43:19.664 --> 00:43:22.400 align:middle line:84%
But you're talking
about being able

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.503 align:middle line:84%
to essentially recharge right
here or recharge your battery.

00:43:25.503 --> 00:43:26.804 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:43:26.804 --> 00:43:28.272 align:middle line:84%
I like to use the analogy,
whole body battery charger.

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:29.941 align:middle line:90%
Because when you lay on the mat,

00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:31.442 align:middle line:84%
you're like in an
electron cloud.

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:33.044 align:middle line:84%
It's like you're -- and
you're getting saturated

00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:34.612 align:middle line:90%
with the earth frequencies.

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:39.083 align:middle line:84%
Again, I like PEMF versus all
the electric field devices and,

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:42.253 align:middle line:84%
again, they all have their place
and they all, you know, do --

00:43:42.253 --> 00:43:45.289 align:middle line:84%
you know, do have some
good effects on them,

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.958 align:middle line:84%
but to me it makes
the most sense.

00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:49.727 align:middle line:84%
It's like, okay, what is it
that the earth is giving us

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:52.797 align:middle line:84%
from the point of view of
the earth's energetics.

00:43:52.797 --> 00:43:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, it's mainly, you
know, the Schumann Resonance

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.403 align:middle line:84%
and the geomagnetic field,
the actual magnetic field.

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So to me it makes sense to --
because we're not getting enough

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.275 align:middle line:90%
of those good fields, you know,

00:44:04.275 --> 00:44:06.777 align:middle line:84%
just like some people will
supplement because the soils are

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.513 align:middle line:90%
so depleted of minerals --

00:44:08.513 --> 00:44:10.948 align:middle line:84%
again, I recommend super
food supplements that are

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:13.851 align:middle line:84%
like whole-food based -- but
still, we need to supplement

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:15.419 align:middle line:84%
because our soils
are so barren --

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:16.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:44:16.187 --> 00:44:17.455 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- of minerals.

00:44:17.455 --> 00:44:18.289 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And the same
thing with the energy sources

00:44:18.289 --> 00:44:19.123 align:middle line:90%
and the magnetic field, yeah.

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:20.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: And energy sources.

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:21.425 align:middle line:90%
So to me it makes sense.

00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:23.394 align:middle line:84%
It's like -- like, you know,
life machines and skanars

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:26.898 align:middle line:84%
and lasers and all these things,
I think, have their place --

00:44:26.898 --> 00:44:29.433 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: A lot of those are
for very targeted use, too.

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.302 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: They're
targeted, but they're not

00:44:31.302 --> 00:44:33.004 align:middle line:84%
like fundamental
elements, you know.

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:34.539 align:middle line:84%
It's like -- it's
like the difference

00:44:34.539 --> 00:44:35.806 align:middle line:90%
between colloidal silver

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:38.042 align:middle line:84%
and like a good full-spectrum
whole-food multivitamin.

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:40.611 align:middle line:84%
The whole food multivitamin's
giving you stuff you need.

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:84%
The colloidal silver is
just kind of targeting,

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.315 align:middle line:84%
trying to kill a pathogen,
so you only take it

00:44:44.315 --> 00:44:46.083 align:middle line:90%
for a short period of time.

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:46.851 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Right.

00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:48.252 align:middle line:90%
I'm with you on all that.

00:44:48.252 --> 00:44:50.488 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So PEMF, to me, is
like that energetic multivitamin

00:44:50.488 --> 00:44:52.690 align:middle line:84%
of sorts, because you're
getting the full-spectrum

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.826 align:middle line:84%
of earth frequencies that
the cells -- based on Addy

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:59.797 align:middle line:84%
and Bowan's study, at the cell
level responds to 0 to 30 hertz.

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:01.098 align:middle line:84%
So, again, that's
why you want to --

00:45:01.098 --> 00:45:02.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Yeah, it was when
I was studying up on this

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.403 align:middle line:84%
for this particular interview,
I noticed people keep talking

00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:07.438 align:middle line:84%
about the effect
that you would expect

00:45:07.438 --> 00:45:08.873 align:middle line:90%
from having charged batteries.

00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:11.542 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not to
dismiss the fact that,

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:12.977 align:middle line:84%
a) a lot of this
can be balanced.

00:45:12.977 --> 00:45:14.612 align:middle line:90%
If you're going to go out,

00:45:14.612 --> 00:45:16.747 align:middle line:84%
go out into the sunshine,
into the woods --

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.082 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.183 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- go out into
nature, lie down on the grass,

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:22.286 align:middle line:84%
eat whole foods, do
things right, breathe.

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:23.921 align:middle line:90%
And you can boost your --

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.189 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, you can.

00:45:25.189 --> 00:45:26.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- own energy
levels to have this healthy --

00:45:26.624 --> 00:45:27.992 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: You could do --

00:45:27.992 --> 00:45:29.193 align:middle line:84%
there's a lot of things you can
do for free, you know, or --

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:30.861 align:middle line:84%
I mean, good food is going
to cost you some money,

00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.363 align:middle line:84%
sometimes good water, I
mean, everything's going

00:45:32.363 --> 00:45:35.466 align:middle line:84%
to be some little costs
involved, but like, you know,

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:37.134 align:middle line:84%
walking barefoot is
a great technique --

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:37.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: -- but, you know,

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:40.438 align:middle line:84%
people in the northern
climates sometimes can't get

00:45:40.438 --> 00:45:43.174 align:middle line:84%
out in the middle winter,
so in just eight minutes,

00:45:43.174 --> 00:45:46.143 align:middle line:84%
twice a day on these PEMF
therapy mats gives you a very

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:48.312 align:middle line:84%
concentrated dose of
that full spectrum --

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:49.447 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: And that's
what you do?

00:45:49.447 --> 00:45:51.015 align:middle line:84%
About eight minutes a
day, you just lie on it

00:45:51.015 --> 00:45:52.283 align:middle line:90%
at once or twice a day --

00:45:52.283 --> 00:45:53.417 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:54.251 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Is that kind
of what most people do?

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.386 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: It's very relaxing.

00:45:55.386 --> 00:45:56.787 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just took it
over just the other day

00:45:56.787 --> 00:45:59.056 align:middle line:84%
to my friend Rich's house, and
he had, like, a stiff shoulder,

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:00.825 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, he
laid on the mat,

00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:03.227 align:middle line:84%
and he got up, and
it's like, wow.

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.228 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Yeah.

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: He's like,
what happened?

00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:06.430 align:middle line:90%
He's like, he didn't know --

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.832 align:middle line:84%
almost didn't know what happened
because, again, that stiffness,

00:46:07.832 --> 00:46:11.268 align:middle line:84%
the pain, sometimes comes from,
you know, too much electrosmog

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.104 align:middle line:84%
and lack of connection
to the earth.

00:46:13.104 --> 00:46:14.472 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Absolutely.

00:46:14.472 --> 00:46:16.107 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: So that's why people
that typically are outdoors,

00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:18.309 align:middle line:84%
like gardening -- I've always
known this, it's like some

00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:20.411 align:middle line:84%
of these long-lived people,
it's like, oh, they're --

00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:21.112 align:middle line:90%
oh, you're a gardener.

00:46:21.112 --> 00:46:22.246 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: A gardener.

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:22.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: Oh, you're
like outside all day.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.248 align:middle line:90%
Like, the hundreds --

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: Exactly.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.451 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: This one lady that's
130 years old was interviewed,

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and you know, she's
still picking tea leaves

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.022 align:middle line:84%
in her hundreds, you know,
but she spent all this time

00:46:31.022 --> 00:46:32.423 align:middle line:90%
out in the mountain fresh air --

00:46:32.423 --> 00:46:33.624 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: In the
sun with the trees.

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.526 align:middle line:84%
>> Meyers: -- so again,
connect yourself to earth

00:46:35.526 --> 00:46:38.963 align:middle line:84%
and the elements -- good food,
good water, sunlight, fresh air,

00:46:38.963 --> 00:46:40.131 align:middle line:90%
and earth's magnetism.

00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:41.465 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: All the things

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.367 align:middle line:84%
that our grandparents would've
told us, absolutely true.

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:44.068 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:46:44.068 --> 00:46:44.835 align:middle line:90%
So ultimately simple --

00:46:44.835 --> 00:46:46.237 align:middle line:90%
>> Regina: And if not --

00:46:46.237 --> 00:46:48.472 align:middle line:84%
the book, what I like about the
book is you really go into --

00:46:48.472 --> 00:46:50.374 align:middle line:84%
you go into a little
of all of this --

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:53.144 align:middle line:84%
the background of the
technologies, but also the need

00:46:53.144 --> 00:46:54.945 align:middle line:84%
for us to start acknowledging
ourselves

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:56.747 align:middle line:90%
as bioelectric human beings.

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:57.348 align:middle line:90%
We have to do that.

00:46:57.348 --> 00:46:58.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah.

00:46:58.683 --> 00:47:00.317 align:middle line:84%
Primarily energy, yeah, and
so we're primarily energy --

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.086 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: You can't just pop
pills and make this thing work.

00:47:02.086 --> 00:47:02.987 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Yeah, exactly.

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:04.522 align:middle line:90%
It's a lifestyle.

00:47:04.522 --> 00:47:05.923 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: Well, I
can't wait to try it.

00:47:05.923 --> 00:47:08.292 align:middle line:84%
Someday I want to lie
on one for a eight minutes

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:09.794 align:middle line:84%
and see what the
effect is myself.

00:47:09.794 --> 00:47:11.662 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking for
the best of as well,

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:13.864 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very intrigued
with this one, so --

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:15.299 align:middle line:84%
that's why I invited
you on today --

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:15.866 align:middle line:90%
>> Meyers: Oh, yeah.

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:16.967 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, yeah.

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:17.735 align:middle line:84%
>> Regina: -- to explain
the technology to us
