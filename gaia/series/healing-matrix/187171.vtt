00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Paul Mills, PhD, is
Professor of Family Medicine

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.800 align:middle line:10%
and Public Health at the
University of California San

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.530 align:middle line:10%
Diego and the Director of
Research for the Chopra

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:10%
Foundation.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
He's published over
350 scientific papers

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.550 align:middle line:84%
with a current focus on
integrative medicine.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Through his extensive
research, he's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
found that true
wellness can only

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:84%
be achieved by healing the whole
person, which he feels is not

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:84%
being fully addressed by the
current integrative medicine

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:90%
model.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mills will share
with us why in order

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:84%
to truly heal yourself, you
need to go beyond your body,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.580 align:middle line:84%
beyond your mind, and into
an experience of oneness.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.682 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Mills, thank you so
much for being here today.

00:01:04.682 --> 00:01:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome, Ben.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.057 align:middle line:84%
Thanks for having
me on your show.

00:01:07.057 --> 00:01:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm really looking forward
to our conversation.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell us just a
little bit of background.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
How did you get to be the
head of the Chopra Foundation,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and just into this
work in general?

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:10%
>> My background, and the focus
of my work at the University

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:10%
of California San Diego, has
been historically in a field

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.520 align:middle line:10%
called psychoneuroimmunology
and behavioral medicine,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.830 align:middle line:10%
and then most recently, the
integrative medicine space.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:10%
So that work that I
had been doing it UCSD

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:10%
was really a perfect
match for the work

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:10%
that Deepak wanted
to help advance

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.580 align:middle line:10%
with the support
of his foundation,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.380 align:middle line:10%
and a lot of his
friends and colleagues

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.070 align:middle line:10%
who want to help move
forward the medical model

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.380 align:middle line:10%
and the wellness
model in the US.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So that word
psychoneuroimmunology,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.480 align:middle line:90%
what is that?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.200 align:middle line:84%
How can people
understand what that is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.912 align:middle line:90%
and the importance of it today?

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:56.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very important, and
it's a field that was launched,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.140 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, in the late '70s.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And it recognizes the
very close relationship

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.260 align:middle line:84%
between our psyche, both
our emotions as well

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.430 align:middle line:84%
as our thoughts, and how those
influence our nervous system

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.080 align:middle line:84%
and the quality of
our nervous system,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.780 align:middle line:84%
and then how the nervous
system downstream is regulating

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.800 align:middle line:90%
our immunity.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's the psycho, the
neuro, and the immunology.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
field relevant to pretty

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
much all the work
I do because it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
provides mechanisms of how
what's going on up here

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.100 align:middle line:90%
influences all this.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.550 align:middle line:84%
>> What would your definition
of real healing be,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:84%
if you could sum
that up somehow?

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, real healing really
gets to the realm of where

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.270 align:middle line:84%
a human being really knows
who and what they are beyond

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:middle line:84%
their mind, beyond
their emotions,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:84%
beyond their personality, beyond
whom they believe themselves

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.740 align:middle line:90%
to be.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And this starts moving into
territories typically called

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.280 align:middle line:84%
self-realization in
eastern traditions,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.520 align:middle line:84%
and also in some of the more
esoteric western traditions.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Deepak Chopra, whose Chopra
foundation Dr. Mills heads,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:90%
has this to say about healing.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> The word healing is actually
the same word as the word holy.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.760 align:middle line:84%
The word holy is the same
word as the word whole, whole,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.450 align:middle line:90%
wholeness.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So healing is the return
of the memory of wholeness.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
You're not just a
body mind in a world.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.412 align:middle line:84%
You are the world
in a body mind.

00:03:31.412 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you're
not just the world.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:84%
You're the whole
universe in a body mind.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is not
metaphorically speaking.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.580 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely--
we're talking

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.130 align:middle line:84%
about scientific modeling of
what we call reality, which

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.660 align:middle line:84%
is still very mysterious because
atoms and molecules and force

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.820 align:middle line:84%
fields and gravity
and everything

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
that we call reality,
these are human constructs

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
for modes of knowing
and experience.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And that's where the mystery is.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.190 align:middle line:90%
How do we know what we know?

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm sure, being the
head of the Chopra Foundation,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.610 align:middle line:84%
a lot of your philosophies
might align or overlap.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.560 align:middle line:84%
But would there be
anything that you

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.977 align:middle line:90%
would add to that explanation?

00:04:16.977 --> 00:04:18.769 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts
on that explanation?

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:90%
>> I concur completely.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.940 align:middle line:84%
It's really a beautiful
clip and a description.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And I remember him
giving that lecture.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
That was out at Point Loma
Nazarene College in San Diego.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.845 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of a
launch of one of his books.

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But really, and
particularly at the end

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.300 align:middle line:84%
where he described
essentially, really,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
every human being is
literally the universe,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
because the
awareness that we are

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.700 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation of
the universe itself.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And the path of-- we
call it spiritual growth,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:90%
it's often termed--

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.220 align:middle line:84%
is one to where a person can
come into the realization

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:90%
of that and live that.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And that really is the
foundation of well-being.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm sure people at the
very precipice of this kind

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:84%
of a journey into
their own self-healing,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
hearing that they are
the entire universe,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.790 align:middle line:84%
could be just a little
bit overwhelming for them.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And for me, this is where
the word integrative comes in

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.880 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:84%
But I would love to
hear your explanation.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.360 align:middle line:84%
What is integrative medicine,
and why that word integrative?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Integrative medicine,
as it's currently defined

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.910 align:middle line:84%
and understood, developed
from what used to be called

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.610 align:middle line:84%
complementary and
alternative medicine.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And that developed from what was
originally called whole person

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:84%
medicine, which
was a movement here

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.830 align:middle line:84%
in the west that also launched
in about the late '70s.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And whole person medicine
was inspired primarily

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.940 align:middle line:84%
from a lot of the eastern
traditional whole person

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
medical systems, Ayurveda,
Tibetan medicine,

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Chinese medicine, Native
American medicine.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
All those traditions had an
understanding and a knowledge

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.120 align:middle line:84%
of really what the human being
is beyond the body, mind,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.610 align:middle line:90%
and spirit.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And so currently
integrative medicine

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is the practice of complementary
therapies such as acupuncture,

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
massage, osteopathic medicine,
energy medicine, such as Reiki

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and healing touch, within
what's called the allopathic

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.230 align:middle line:90%
or the biomedical model.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So at UCSD, for example,
where I am full time,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.300 align:middle line:84%
we have a center for
integrative medicine,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and it's throughout our
inpatient and hospital system.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.180 align:middle line:84%
And people can get not only
their traditional therapies

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.790 align:middle line:84%
and surgeries, but
they can be prescribed

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
acupuncture and energy
medicine and on and on and on.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:84%
It's very good, it's developed,
and it's made a big difference.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
But there's more to
go, is my opinion.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm sure.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It seems like it's a
fairly new approach

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.960 align:middle line:84%
to take the old as well as
a lot of the new medicine

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:84%
that we've, in the allopathic
model, been understanding.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So with that, what
would your definition

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.090 align:middle line:90%
of integrative health then be?

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So integrative
health, I would say,

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
is the next iteration
beyond integrative medicine.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:84%
So integrative health is
as a term that's come,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:90%
maybe, the last few years.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting
more into the concept

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.670 align:middle line:90%
of wellness and well-being.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And it is incorporating
more completely concepts

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual well-being that
the integrative medicine

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.000 align:middle line:90%
model has yet to fully grasp.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's also doing a better
job appreciating and bringing

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.430 align:middle line:84%
the whole person into
the medical system.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But integrative health also
incorporates social health,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.170 align:middle line:90%
environmental health.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And this really circles back
to these traditional health

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:84%
systems, which also took
all that into account when

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
they were trying to get
a human being to be well

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
again and healthy, and live a
whole life, a productive life.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.080 align:middle line:84%
>> So the current biomedical
paradigm right now,

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.910 align:middle line:84%
how would you foresee
integrative medicine,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.850 align:middle line:84%
integrative health
fitting into that?

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.380 align:middle line:90%
Is there resistance to it?

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Or is it kind of an open
playing field right now?

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Both.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
Historically there
was resistance.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
integrative medicine--

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:84%
the modalities such as
meditation and acupuncture that

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.900 align:middle line:84%
are within the
biomedical model--

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.460 align:middle line:84%
they're so-called
evidence-based.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
That means there's
been enough research

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to show that they work, and
therefore we've allowed them

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.557 align:middle line:90%
into the biomedical model.

00:08:18.557 --> 00:08:20.390 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't know, for
example, meditation.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:24.350 align:middle line:84%
If you went online to the
PubMed biomedical system, which

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:28.100 align:middle line:84%
has 29 scientific publications,
there's over 5,000 studies

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.940 align:middle line:84%
now on meditation,
about 4,500 on yoga,

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:90%
probably 15,000 acupuncture.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of evidence how
these things are good for us,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.159 align:middle line:84%
and they help us reduce risk
factors and improve mood

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.725 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
ones that end up

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.990 align:middle line:84%
in the biomedical
allopathic model

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%
because the evidence is there.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.580 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
that the evidence is there.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.020 align:middle line:84%
Do you see any
preponderance of evidence

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
in fields that are just
being completely ignored

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.052 align:middle line:90%
by the current paradigm?

00:08:59.052 --> 00:09:01.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The answer is yes,
and there's a fair amount

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.390 align:middle line:84%
of evidence in the healing
touch, hands on healing model,

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
which is often called
biofield sciences these days.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.420 align:middle line:84%
But even though there's a
fair amount of evidence,

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:90%
there still is resistance.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand why
because the western model

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:90%
is very reductionistic.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.390 align:middle line:90%
You have to have evidence.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And right now there's
no scientific evidence

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.600 align:middle line:84%
proving the existence of the
biofield, this field of energy

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds a human being.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
And we really need
that evidence.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And we have friends
who are working hard

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:84%
to develop technologies that
can visualize it and show

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:90%
the information in the field.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Once that's there
and developed, it's

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.680 align:middle line:84%
going to be a complete game
changer on multiple levels,

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.560 align:middle line:84%
not only for the
practice of medicine,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:84%
but also for us to
really appreciate

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.630 align:middle line:84%
what the human being
is beyond this material

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:84%
substance, and all the energy
that supports the material

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.660 align:middle line:90%
body that surrounds it.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess that's really the
biggest thing that I'm noticing

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
today, whereas all
these technologies are

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.900 align:middle line:84%
in their infancy, is the more
we come to an understanding

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
of what we have to take
into account for healing,

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.698 align:middle line:84%
the more we're understanding
what is a human to begin with.

00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:13.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
different facets to it.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
So you mention the whole
person quite a bit.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.010 align:middle line:84%
How does integrative
medicine actually

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.880 align:middle line:84%
take a look at what you
would call the whole person?

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:90%
>> It's getting there.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.480 align:middle line:84%
So for me, as we said
earlier, the whole person

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.330 align:middle line:84%
has to do with bringing
in the true understanding

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual nature, and
let's say beyond that, even

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.640 align:middle line:90%
the transcendent nature.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So integrative medicine
isn't quite there yet, fully

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.040 align:middle line:90%
appreciating that.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
But it has pulled
in more the nature

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.400 align:middle line:84%
of the mind and emotions,
which oddly enough,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.100 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps surprisingly, were
often missing historically

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:90%
in the practice of medicine.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.470 align:middle line:84%
And even today, in most
biomedical systems,

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:84%
people come in and you're
really primarily a symptom,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.225 align:middle line:84%
and that symptom's
being treated,

00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
moved on to pharmacy

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.500 align:middle line:90%
and you're out the door.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
limited perspective

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:90%
on how to get a person well.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Now there's traditional
medical systems, Ayurveda,

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:15.260 align:middle line:90%
traditional Chinese medicine.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.870 align:middle line:84%
In your understanding,
do these medical systems

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
take into account
the whole person?

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.410 align:middle line:90%
>> They very much do indeed.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm familiar with Ayurveda
and somewhat Chinese medicine.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
More so with Tibetan medicine.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
My wife Tiffany and I've
been to India a few times,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Tibet a few times,
studying these systems,

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.540 align:middle line:84%
speaking with other
physicians and scientists

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
there, learning about
their perspectives.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And those systems evolved
out of so much wisdom

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
beyond the medical
portion of what they do.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And the wisdom of
those systems is

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.320 align:middle line:84%
referring to the transcendent
aspects, the consciousness

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:90%
aspects of the human being.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the foundation of how
they treat the body itself,

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.510 align:middle line:84%
is knowing that the body is
an expression of consciousness

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.820 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The Gaia series "Thrive"
delved into Ayurveda,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
the ancient system
of Indian healing.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.702 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look.

00:12:11.702 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:18.710 align:middle line:10%
- Ayurveda is a 5,000 year old
system of medicine from India.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
Ayur is life and
veda is knowledge.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:90%
So it is the knowledge of life.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:84%
- Ayurveda it is not
part of a culture.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.440 align:middle line:10%
It's a universal knowledge that
enlightened sages drew through

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.300 align:middle line:10%
in order to help us, in order
to help humanity with health

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:10%
and happiness and wholeness.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to perceive,
with their subtle awareness,

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that these elements
were actually

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.760 align:middle line:84%
elements of the quantum field,
that even before creation has

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.490 align:middle line:84%
manifested, there are these
primary tendencies or energies

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
that modern physics
is now characterizing.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.470 align:middle line:10%
- And in deep-seated
meditations,

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:10%
they saw over periods of time
how these different aspects

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.860 align:middle line:10%
of nature affected
different parts of our body.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.660 align:middle line:10%
They made a system of wellness,
medicine, holistic medicine,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:23.993 align:middle line:10%
meaning herbal medicine, and
dietary influences, things

00:13:23.993 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:10%
that you can put into
the body to create

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.250 align:middle line:10%
balance inside of you.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So in these traditional
practices of medicine

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
the whole person,

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.140 align:middle line:90%
we just heard there meditation.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Do you practice meditation?

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I do, yeah.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:42.260 align:middle line:84%
I learned when I
was in high school,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.097 align:middle line:84%
and it was really a
game changer and led me

00:13:44.097 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
into a whole new
direction in my life,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
including how I decided
to pursue science.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.090 align:middle line:84%
But I'd like to add that
was a beautiful clip.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he was
saying about Ayurveda

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.520 align:middle line:84%
grew out of these enlightened
sages' understanding

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.620 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of
the universe itself,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of
consciousness itself.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And they use that to build
the knowledge about how

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:90%
best to take care of this body.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.140 align:middle line:84%
That's a completely
different way

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.700 align:middle line:84%
than we've had medicine
practiced in the west,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.827 align:middle line:84%
isn't it, where
we have a symptom,

00:14:12.827 --> 00:14:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and we figure something out
for that particular symptom.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.725 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know what's
going on beyond that down

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
to these other levels,
and particularly

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:90%
the consciousness itself.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.920 align:middle line:84%
So these ancient systems
all started that way.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
There's wisdom in them,
not just knowledge.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So would you say these
ancient medical systems are

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:84%
kind of the opposite
of the reductionist?

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.363 align:middle line:90%
Would you say it's the opposite?

00:14:35.363 --> 00:14:36.418 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:37.270 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.720 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.280 align:middle line:84%
These ancient systems
were built on holism.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.670 align:middle line:84%
The current biomedical system
is based on reductionism,

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.670 align:middle line:90%
as you said, which is duality.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:84%
So the basic medical
model we have

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is based on kind
of a flawed premise

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.930 align:middle line:84%
that the human being is
separate from the environment,

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
is separate from themselves,
is separate from the universe.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.270 align:middle line:84%
These traditional
systems completely

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.202 align:middle line:84%
have a different knowledge,
a knowingness, actually.

00:15:04.202 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:90%
It's beyond just a knowledge.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.100 align:middle line:84%
It's knowing the reality of the
oneness of this entire system

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.655 align:middle line:90%
that we exist in.

00:15:11.655 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So I want to
know, personally,

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
what was it that I guess
switched you on to some

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
of these topics that made you
want to kind of dive a little

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.367 align:middle line:90%
bit deeper beneath the surface?

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I mentioned a minute ago,
when I was in high school I

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:90%
learned meditation.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:84%
At the time, what
was really big in

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the US was called
transcendental meditation.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.080 align:middle line:84%
Nowadays it's more
the mindfulness.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And I really took a deep dive
into TM practice, knowledge.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
I went on a lot of extended
courses, did my training.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.600 align:middle line:84%
My PhD is in neuroscience,
and I studied

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.380 align:middle line:84%
neuroscience in the context
of consciousness itself.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,
who brought TM to the west,

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.920 align:middle line:84%
he spoke a lot about these
ideas about the nature

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, the
potential for human beings

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to develop their
consciousness, to things

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
such as self-realization,
the wholeness of things.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And eventually he also began to
teach and speak about Ayurveda,

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:15.580 align:middle line:84%
which is so popular and valuable
today in our western system.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to
point out is that,

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.100 align:middle line:84%
getting back to the
integrative idea,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:84%
so historically you had
to clip in Ayurveda.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.870 align:middle line:84%
People didn't go to an
Ayurvedic physician.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.040 align:middle line:90%
He said, go practice meditation.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.420 align:middle line:84%
He taught you meditation,
yoga, gave you certain herbs,

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.370 align:middle line:84%
gave you knowledge, mantras
about your consciousness.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.390 align:middle line:84%
It was all done in an
integrated, whole person,

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:90%
holism package.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:45.820 align:middle line:84%
But when these techniques
came to us in the west,

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.540 align:middle line:84%
they were in the
reductionist model.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.960 align:middle line:84%
I will learn meditation, and
that's all I'm going to do.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to learn
yoga or breathing

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:90%
techniques, et cetera.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And that model is
what we're trying

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to overcome with a lot
of our Chopra Foundation.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And now the work at
UCSD is to package these

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.800 align:middle line:84%
all back together
into this whole system

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.530 align:middle line:84%
because when you
practice them together,

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
the effects are not just
mathematically additive,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.910 align:middle line:84%
they're exponential,
and it's cumulative.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:84%
The whole is greater than the
sum of the parts, this idea.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why health
systems are so powerful.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that, I think,
speaks to the word integrative.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.250 align:middle line:84%
When I hear the
word integrative,

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.350 align:middle line:90%
I really feel that--

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
let's say you're a carpenter
and you have a bunch of tools.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
And one tool might be
meditation, if you will,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:90%
metaphorically.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Another one would
be these mantras.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Another one would be,
let's say, the diet.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
But to you, the
integrative-- that word--

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:48.220 align:middle line:84%
mean as the witness
or the observer,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.390 align:middle line:84%
we have these tools
at our disposal.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But there's a way that we
need to understand which

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:90%
tool is right for the moment.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And is that where the guide
comes in, or the guru?

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Historically that's correct.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.500 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to get some of
our western medical teachers

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:84%
and physicians to
learn more that role.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And at UCSD, we
have consultations

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
from people from
traditional systems.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So we have what's called the
Pacific College of Oriental

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.730 align:middle line:90%
Medicine in San Diego.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And we have teachers
from their college

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:84%
come and give lectures
to us at UC San

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.340 align:middle line:84%
Diego, and our
public health system

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.580 align:middle line:84%
students and the integrative
medicine students.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have people
coming in from Ayureda.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:84%
So we're cross-seeding
these traditions,

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.990 align:middle line:84%
trying to transform at least
the western model at San Diego.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.940 align:middle line:84%
And other people are trying
that, too, at other, say,

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
academic hospital
systems in the US.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Your definition of
non-dual awareness.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.580 align:middle line:90%
What would that be?

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd say the best
definition is oneness.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
So non-duality as
a word literally

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.122 align:middle line:84%
means not two, or
not more than two.

00:18:59.122 --> 00:19:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So the opposite of
that is oneness.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So non-duality is
a term currently

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.800 align:middle line:84%
pretty common and
popular in the,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.690 align:middle line:84%
say, more the esoteric aspects
of wellness here in the US.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.792 align:middle line:84%
There's an entire group called
Science and Non-Duality, SANDS,

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:15.250 align:middle line:84%
and they host an
annual conference,

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:90%
and there's books on this.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
But it really refers to a
human coming into the awareness

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.638 align:middle line:90%
of the oneness of awareness.

00:19:24.638 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:90%
So what's the opposite of that?

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.000 align:middle line:90%
The opposite of that is duality.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.310 align:middle line:84%
The opposite of
that is separation.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:33.850 align:middle line:84%
And most people do
perceive separation.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
Most people feel they're
living in the mind body,

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
sometimes often here,
and that they're living

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
and they're projecting
out into the world.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.630 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm here, you're there.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.270 align:middle line:84%
The wall's there, the
mountain's there, and so forth.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:90%
They're separate from.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.680 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is that that is
an illusion that unfortunately

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:90%
exists.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps there's reason
for it in play or display

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:90%
of creation.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.200 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that it's
possible for a human being

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.140 align:middle line:84%
to overcome that
illusion of duality

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.710 align:middle line:84%
and come back into the ongoing
experience of the oneness

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
of everything, so that no
longer am I perceived separately

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.540 align:middle line:90%
from you.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.620 align:middle line:90%
You are me.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.940 align:middle line:90%
That wall is me.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:90%
The universe itself is myself.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:90%
It's all my own self.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.400 align:middle line:84%
It's all my own
home, and I'm here

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.907 align:middle line:84%
living the life that
unfolds before me.

00:20:22.907 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's also--

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say it's the
easiest thing to live by.

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure it's
a roller coaster.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.100 align:middle line:84%
You can get into these
moments of non-dual awareness

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:84%
and then whatever, go
home to visit your family,

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.200 align:middle line:84%
and then it's all
out the window,

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's that
forgetting, it seems.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Initially that can happen.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.070 align:middle line:10%
But ultimately, at
the end of the day,

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.040 align:middle line:10%
it's possible for a human
being to come into that state

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:10%
where that is utterly
and completely permanent.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.250 align:middle line:10%
That oneness of consciousness,
of awareness is not lost.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:84%
The unity with all things,
the oneness is not lost.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
You're still
perceiving your mind

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.110 align:middle line:84%
having thoughts, your
mind having emotions.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But it never takes you
out of the wholeness.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is really the
birthright, I would say,

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:90%
of a human being.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.235 align:middle line:84%
And it's the foundation
of well-being,

00:21:15.235 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:84%
getting back to some of
our earlier questions

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
about what is really
wellness and well-being?

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.550 align:middle line:90%
It's being able to live in that.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
It is possible, and it happens,
and it's happening every day.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So eastern concepts
of self-realization.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Is that the same thing, or fits
into the same understanding?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:90%
I would say yes.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.120 align:middle line:90%
Self-realization.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:90%
There's that term.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.778 align:middle line:90%
You hear terms of enlightenment.

00:21:39.778 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you go to
conferences on this,

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and people who are into
studying all these books

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and philosophies and
different traditions,

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.152 align:middle line:90%
they'll be kind of nit picking.

00:21:46.152 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, enlightenment means this,
and self-realization actually

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.270 align:middle line:84%
means this, and no
self means this.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And there are nuances
within traditions,

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.260 align:middle line:84%
depending on, perhaps, how the
own master of that tradition,

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.575 align:middle line:84%
or the priest or whoever it was,
came into their realization,

00:22:03.575 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
and then they carried
down descriptions

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.000 align:middle line:90%
and understandings.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.330 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of the day,
what I'm talking about--

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
and I think the ideal of
all these traditions--

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
is coming into the state
of wellness, which is

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:90%
a kind of unity consciousness.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned earlier
the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:90%
who brought TM to the west.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:84%
He spoke about seven
stages of consciousness,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.940 align:middle line:84%
developing up to what
he called unity and then

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:90%
Brahmin consciousness.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And unity is a good description
of this notion of non-duality

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking
about a oneness, actually.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And if I were to modify
it a bit, if I can,

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
I would say more the Brahmin
consciousness is actually

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:84%
a corresponding term for
this idea of non-duality

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:84%
because even in unity, it
implies that I as a person

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:56.080 align:middle line:84%
am feeling in union
with that or with you.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.330 align:middle line:84%
But actually, even those
experiences go away.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.700 align:middle line:84%
There's no more separate you
to be in union with everything.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.125 align:middle line:90%
Everything is you.

00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:06.250 align:middle line:90%
So that's just the oneness.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And that, I think, is what he
meant by Brahmin consciousness.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So we were talking about
contemplative practices.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm assuming that's what
you mean, these practices that

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.440 align:middle line:90%
have been around a while.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Meditation, obviously,
yoga, Tai Chi and qigong.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.660 align:middle line:84%
What kind of role
do these practices

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.500 align:middle line:84%
play in the path towards
non-dual awareness?

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I think multiple levels.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, as an
integrated package,

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.100 align:middle line:84%
all these things help maintain
our health and well-being

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.770 align:middle line:90%
of our body, of our psyche.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.850 align:middle line:84%
Meditation and the
practice of yoga

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.780 align:middle line:84%
can just foster a
sense of expansiveness,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.270 align:middle line:84%
going beyond just the
ruminating thoughts that

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
go through many of
our heads endlessly,

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:84%
going beyond just this belief
that I am these thoughts.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:90%
I am this personality.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.570 align:middle line:90%
I am this career I've chosen.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you can do
to start softening up

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that programming
and that belief,

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
because really, at
the end of the day,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.910 align:middle line:84%
if I were to say what is
responsible for the state

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:10.090 align:middle line:84%
of separation, the
state of duality,

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:13.060 align:middle line:84%
it's because a person
believes that they

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.345 align:middle line:84%
are this ego mind that
they're perceiving

00:24:17.345 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:90%
through all the time.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.700 align:middle line:84%
They believe they are that,
and that creates separation.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Once you soften that up and
you can let that belief go,

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.530 align:middle line:90%
separation disappears.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:90%
Duality disappears.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the underlying
root cause, really,

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.782 align:middle line:84%
the belief that that is
you, when you are this.

00:24:37.782 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Here's Deepak Chopra speaking
about the healing benefits

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
of practices such as
yoga and meditation.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.540 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.830 align:middle line:84%
- But now we also have very
interesting research on Yoga

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.630 align:middle line:90%
and meditation.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Again, at the Chopra
Center, I think

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.110 align:middle line:90%
Paul Mills is somewhere here.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Paul, are you here?

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:90%
There.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
He's the Director of
Research, professor at UCSD

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:84%
responsible for directing
all the research we do,

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
coordinating with all
the other centers.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:84%
We now know that yoga and
meditation and pranayama

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:84%
have very specific
effects, primarily,

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.190 align:middle line:84%
I think, because of
this vagus nerve.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:20.410 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing yoga asanas
like Cat Cow or Sun Salutation,

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.235 align:middle line:84%
you're simulating
the vagus nerve.

00:25:22.235 --> 00:25:23.860 align:middle line:84%
When you're doing
breathing techniques,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.510 align:middle line:90%
you're doing the same.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:84%
And so that has a
very specific effect.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we can
create a whole map

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.340 align:middle line:84%
of which nerves,
which visceral nerves,

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:84%
are specifically stimulated
during the yoga asanas

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.120 align:middle line:90%
for which organ in the body.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.662 align:middle line:90%
Pranayama similarly.

00:25:44.662 --> 00:25:46.120 align:middle line:84%
There are breathing
techniques that

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.150 align:middle line:84%
will increase metabolism,
decrease metabolism, cool you

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.900 align:middle line:90%
down, warm you up.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So this is a whole
different way of looking

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.450 align:middle line:90%
at our biological organisms.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.680 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a nice
shout out to you.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So as far as yoga,
do you practice yoga?

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I learned yoga shortly
after I learned meditation.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.740 align:middle line:84%
What benefit do you feel
you get out of it, truly?

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:90%
>> From yoga itself?

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
It helps me maintain a more
relaxed state of my body,

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.500 align:middle line:90%
say my body mind.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I have a fairly heavy career
work life, more than 100% job

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.360 align:middle line:90%
at the University of California.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And then working with Deepak's
group is maybe another 80%.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.080 align:middle line:90%
I've lost track.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.910 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty demanding.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And so these kinds
of practices helped

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.790 align:middle line:84%
me maintain a good
sense of well-being.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you looked into to plant
medicines in those practices

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.383 align:middle line:84%
and their impact on
well-being and health?

00:26:50.383 --> 00:26:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, a couple
of things on that.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.820 align:middle line:84%
One is regarding the plant
medicines of, say, Peru

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.340 align:middle line:84%
and South America,
I'll give a shout out

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.680 align:middle line:84%
to Joseph Tafur, MD, who wrote a
book "Fellowship of the River".

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.180 align:middle line:84%
He was a postdoctoral
fellow in my group,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.590 align:middle line:84%
and I'm familiar
with what you're

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
saying because of his
work over the years

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:08.840 align:middle line:90%
traveling down to Peru.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:84%
He set up a healing
center there,

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.135 align:middle line:84%
and people go
there for pursuing,

00:27:13.135 --> 00:27:16.960 align:middle line:84%
say, aspects of well-being
on their journey.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.510 align:middle line:84%
As far as my own
research, it's been mainly

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.660 align:middle line:84%
in the context of
the Ayurvedia system.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
So the research I've done
with the Chopra Foundation

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.510 align:middle line:84%
was looking at Ayurveda
as an entire prescription.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.110 align:middle line:84%
So we would give people
their meditation, their yoga

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.700 align:middle line:84%
practice, their herbs, their
stretching practice, lectures,

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:90%
all in one intensive package.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And we studied how that shifted
them over about a week or so.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the herbs are
used within the context

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.190 align:middle line:84%
of the whole system,
not so much prescribed

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.410 align:middle line:90%
as a separate phenomenon.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's some of the research
Deepak was referring to

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.980 align:middle line:90%
in the video clip.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know that, having
actually spent some time with

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Tafur--

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:02.110 align:middle line:84%
not down in the
jungle, but I know him.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.970 align:middle line:90%
Very amazing individual.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.890 align:middle line:84%
And spent time in
the jungle, a lot

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.340 align:middle line:84%
of what I come out of
these practices with

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.840 align:middle line:90%
is the most beautiful part.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.400 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes even the
sharing circle afterwards

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.700 align:middle line:84%
is some of the most
beautiful parts

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.540 align:middle line:84%
because you can see the
gratitude inside everyone

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
as they're sharing
their experience.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of found
that gratitude

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.420 align:middle line:84%
must play such an
integral role in not just

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.468 align:middle line:90%
health, but well-being.

00:28:30.468 --> 00:28:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So what are your thoughts on
that, that word gratitude?

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.640 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Gratitude.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.773 align:middle line:90%
There's so much to say about it.

00:28:36.773 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you some of my
thoughts around it, what it is,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.760 align:middle line:84%
and then I can
share with you some

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.302 align:middle line:84%
of the research
we've done, actually,

00:28:42.302 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
at the University of
California San Diego.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:90%
So what is gratitude?

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people have described
gratitude as an emotion.

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Saint Paul described it in some
of his letters as a virtue.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:90%
My experience with gratitude--

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.010 align:middle line:84%
so gratitude is a word that
we give to an experience

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.030 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have an
experience of energy.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.410 align:middle line:84%
We have an experience of
a change in our awareness

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.730 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness.

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.450 align:middle line:84%
What we call
gratitude, for me, that

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:17.150 align:middle line:84%
is the manifestation of love,
moving through this creation,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:19.280 align:middle line:90%
as we call it.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.550 align:middle line:84%
If a person were to have the
understanding or belief--

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.310 align:middle line:84%
and you've heard this, that
love is all there is, actually--

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day, this
entire creation and everything

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.557 align:middle line:90%
beyond it is love itself.

00:29:29.557 --> 00:29:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And the creation is the
movement and manifestation

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.660 align:middle line:84%
of love in endless,
endless forms.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.490 align:middle line:84%
The manifestation of basic
primal phenomenon of love,

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:43.070 align:middle line:84%
as it comes into a
manifestation, that movement,

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.580 align:middle line:84%
that energy is what
we call gratitude.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:50.390 align:middle line:84%
The energy that we experience,
and we call it gratitude.

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that's why it's
such a transformative practice

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.610 align:middle line:84%
because it takes a person
out of that ego consciousness

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:00.140 align:middle line:84%
we were describing earlier,
and it provides an opening.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.640 align:middle line:84%
It's an energy that
does this to a person.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.670 align:middle line:84%
It reduces separation
and boundaries

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.880 align:middle line:84%
and it creates connectivity,
which is exactly what you said.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And that gets back to
the idea of community,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.115 align:middle line:84%
which you asked about earlier
as we're on these journeys,

00:30:12.115 --> 00:30:14.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's meditation
or yoga or plant medicine.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:90%
Community.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.280 align:middle line:84%
It helps dissolve the
illusion of separation.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.900 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd mentioned the
practice of gratitude.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.630 align:middle line:84%
What does that mean
to you in your life,

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and how it can help
people understand

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.830 align:middle line:84%
how to put gratitude,
this thing that we're

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.930 align:middle line:84%
trying to understand,
into an actual practice

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.460 align:middle line:90%
that we can cultivate?

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>> So many ways.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of the research
we've used at UC San Diego,

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.460 align:middle line:90%
we've done journaling.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And so these particular
research projects

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.470 align:middle line:84%
we did were in patients
with heart failure.

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.500 align:middle line:84%
A lot of my research is in
the field of cardiology.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.170 align:middle line:84%
And we were studying
heart failure patients

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.540 align:middle line:84%
along a certain severity
of their diagnosis.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So we did a
randomized trial where

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.520 align:middle line:84%
we randomized some of
them to keep a gratitude

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.560 align:middle line:90%
journal for eight weeks.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And the other patients were
randomized to usual care,

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:07.820 align:middle line:84%
whatever that was, some drugs
and special diet and so forth.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And we tracked what happened
to these patients just

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.525 align:middle line:84%
from eight weeks of
keeping a journal.

00:31:12.525 --> 00:31:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And we gave them
these pretty journals.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.470 align:middle line:90%
We said, here.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Most days of the week, write
down two or three things

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.510 align:middle line:90%
that you're grateful for.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.280 align:middle line:90%
You can write two words.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You can write two
pages, 20 pages.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And many did all those
things because we collected

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:28.028 align:middle line:84%
the journals at
the end of the day,

00:31:28.028 --> 00:31:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and we're actually looking
at the content now.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.780 align:middle line:90%
But what we found was amazing.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.960 align:middle line:84%
Certainly the trait of
gratitude went up in those

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.460 align:middle line:84%
because they were
thinking about it.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.880 align:middle line:84%
We call it you're shifting
to an attitude of gratitude

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.040 align:middle line:84%
when you spend
time looking at it.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:90%
The depressed mood went down.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Their cardiac functioning,
which is a key to heart failure

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.200 align:middle line:84%
itself and maintaining
health, improved

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:90%
while they were journaling.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Also, most
cardiovascular diseases

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.390 align:middle line:84%
have a fairly heavy
inflammatory burden.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure
this in the blood

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.120 align:middle line:84%
by looking at biomarkers
such as CRP or B type

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.690 align:middle line:84%
natriuretic peptide,
interleukin 6, things like this.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.920 align:middle line:84%
Those biomarkers, as a
panel, dropped about 23%

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.648 align:middle line:84%
just over those two months
while they were journaling.

00:32:15.648 --> 00:32:17.690 align:middle line:84%
If we looked at the patients
that didn't journal,

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:19.580 align:middle line:84%
they just stick with
the normal therapy,

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.260 align:middle line:90%
they had no change at all.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:25.070 align:middle line:84%
So gratitude is an
incredibly powerful practice,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.130 align:middle line:84%
not only for the mind and the
sense of spiritual nature,

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.350 align:middle line:84%
but just the
physical body itself.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to get back to that.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.630 align:middle line:84%
You said-- let me see
if I got this right.

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.380 align:middle line:84%
There's an
anti-inflammatory component,

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.480 align:middle line:84%
it seems, to gratitude,
to a state of being.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And you've actually noticed
that it's while journaling?

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Or how do people tap into this,
because this is incredible?

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Anti-inflammatory,
understanding now

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:57.080 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of even
autoimmune disease

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.190 align:middle line:84%
might have come from chronic
inflammation in the gut.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.060 align:middle line:90%
And more than just autoimmune.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But so this is very important
in healing. s And gratitude

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.480 align:middle line:84%
itself actually has that much
of an impact on the body.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> So most people-- and often
in depression and in heart

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.660 align:middle line:90%
failure, there's depressed mood.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It's partly from the
inflammation load,

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.810 align:middle line:84%
but part of it's just carrying
around a diagnosis that's

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
not so promising
potentially, depending

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:84%
how well you're able to
adhere to the therapeutic

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:27.720 align:middle line:90%
recommendations.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So these things are
kind of stressors,

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.820 align:middle line:90%
and stressors create separation.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.392 align:middle line:84%
Like depression
creates separation.

00:33:34.392 --> 00:33:35.850 align:middle line:84%
When a person is
depressed, they're

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:38.340 align:middle line:84%
kind of like this, and
the world's something

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.090 align:middle line:84%
foreign and awful and
there's no happiness.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And the gratitude,
I think, works

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.140 align:middle line:84%
to reduce the inflammation
and reduce the stress

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.570 align:middle line:90%
because it helps you reconnect.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.790 align:middle line:84%
That's our normal
state, connectedness.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:53.310 align:middle line:90%
We're social beings, after all.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're more
socialized and connected,

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I think our body just
naturally relaxes,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.150 align:middle line:90%
and our psyche as well.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And we draw all the nourishment
from it, probably, too.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Joe DiSpenza has done
a great deal of research

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:08.520 align:middle line:84%
into the effects of elevated
emotions such as gratitude

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.230 align:middle line:90%
on healing and well-being.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Here he is on
Gaia's "Open Minds".

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:13.190 align:middle line:90%
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.090 align:middle line:10%
- I think that you and I have
been hypnotized and conditioned

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.320 align:middle line:10%
into believing we need
a reason to give thanks.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.989 align:middle line:10%
We wait for something
outside of us

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:21.780 align:middle line:10%
to change how we
feel inside of us.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:10%
And the moment, we feel
differently inside of us,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.510 align:middle line:10%
we acknowledge whatever
it was outside of us.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.170 align:middle line:10%
That's how gratitude works.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:29.920 align:middle line:10%
The event happens, and
you give gratitude.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.920 align:middle line:10%
But if you think about
the emotional signature

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.679 align:middle line:10%
of gratitude, gratitude means
the event has already happened,

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.880 align:middle line:10%
or it's happening to you.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.050 align:middle line:10%
So when you begin to
marry a clear intention,

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:46.449 align:middle line:10%
you rehearse what your
future is going to be like,

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.400 align:middle line:10%
you can change the
circuitry in your brain

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.530 align:middle line:10%
to look like the event
has already occurred.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:51.780 align:middle line:10%
That's what neuroscience says.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.440 align:middle line:10%
That's what mental
rehearsal does.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:10%
So now your brain is no
longer a record of the past.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.270 align:middle line:10%
Now it's a map to the future.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.620 align:middle line:10%
If you marry that rehearsal
of a clear intention,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.610 align:middle line:10%
and you review your
behaviors and your choices

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.620 align:middle line:10%
and you review
those experiences,

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.020 align:middle line:10%
and you're intent
on that, but then

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.870 align:middle line:10%
you marry it with the
elevated emotion of gratitude,

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.690 align:middle line:10%
your body, as the
unconscious mind,

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.700 align:middle line:10%
believes that the event
has already occurred.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.680 align:middle line:10%
And you're signaling
new genes in new ways

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:10%
because to your body,
it already happened.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:20.920 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.030 align:middle line:10%
- So the materialists will
wait for their healing

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.290 align:middle line:10%
to happen and give gratitude.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.150 align:middle line:10%
We say the quantum mind already
experienced the healing.

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:33.700 align:middle line:10%
So we don't get up
from our meditations,

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.560 align:middle line:10%
or praying that our
prayers are answered.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.500 align:middle line:10%
We get up from our meditations
as if our prayers are already

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:10%
answered.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:39.630 align:middle line:10%
- Yes.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.230 align:middle line:10%
- And that absolute
state of being,

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.490 align:middle line:10%
where mind body are like that,
if you practice that every day,

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.130 align:middle line:10%
it will begin to
become familiar to you.

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.170 align:middle line:10%
You'll be able to turn it
on in a matter of seconds.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.990 align:middle line:10%
And so then when you have--

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:55.202 align:middle line:10%
and we've seen this on so
many of our brain scans

00:35:55.202 --> 00:35:56.160 align:middle line:10%
in all of our students.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.000 align:middle line:10%
- And you have many
of them in here

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.390 align:middle line:10%
with the stories that
go along with the scans.

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:10%
- But one of the cool things
that happens in our workshops

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:10%
is we're capturing
amplitudes of energy

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:10%
in people's brains that
are 10 times, 20 times,

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:10%
30 times normal, which means
the inner experience is greater

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.510 align:middle line:10%
than any past experience.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.180 align:middle line:10%
And that's the moment the
rewriting the program.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.790 align:middle line:10%
That's the field moving
through their body.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.380 align:middle line:10%
That's the field moving
through their nervous system.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:26.500 align:middle line:10%
And we're capturing
that in real time.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.852 align:middle line:10%
They can't make that happen.

00:36:28.852 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:10%
You can't say to the person,
make your brain do that.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.890 align:middle line:10%
It's happening to them.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.590 align:middle line:10%
And when it happens to
them to such a degree,

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.510 align:middle line:10%
the inner experience
becoming more

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.508 align:middle line:10%
real than any past experience
is a moment I'll never forget.

00:36:40.508 --> 00:36:42.550 align:middle line:10%
And that's the moment the
circuits in their brain

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:middle line:10%
are rewritten, and
that's the moment

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.320 align:middle line:10%
the energy and the
emotion is greater

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.460 align:middle line:10%
than the past experience.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.710 align:middle line:10%
And that's the moment the
body responds to a new mind.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.370 align:middle line:90%
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:52.828 align:middle line:84%
>> Pretty interesting
take on that.

00:36:52.828 --> 00:36:55.460 align:middle line:84%
So what are your thoughts
on that explanation?

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Couple things.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.500 align:middle line:90%
That was fabulous.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.650 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know he was doing
such in-depth research

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.490 align:middle line:90%
on these topics.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate
what he's doing,

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:84%
and the description of the
transformation for the people.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.970 align:middle line:90%
A couple of things.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.120 align:middle line:84%
I think, in part,
it's semantics.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
differentiated gratitude

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.840 align:middle line:84%
from thankfulness, thankfulness
being an idea that we

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.330 align:middle line:90%
receive something from someone.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:90%
We're thankful for that.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a response to
something that's given

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.290 align:middle line:90%
or something that takes place.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we first
started off that clip.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:29.680 align:middle line:90%
It's related to gratitude.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But as I see gratitude,
gratitude is-- basically

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.670 align:middle line:90%
it's a state of being.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.240 align:middle line:84%
It's something you
live with all the time.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It's not in response
to something someone

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.320 align:middle line:90%
gave you or did for you.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:84%
It's part of your
soul nature, we

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.660 align:middle line:84%
could say, your actual
spiritual essence.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And to carry that around
all the time changes

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.490 align:middle line:84%
your perception
of the world, who

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.460 align:middle line:90%
you're with, what you're doing.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So I see it as a very
fundamental feature

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.740 align:middle line:90%
of our makeup, we could say.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you working on now?

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.450 align:middle line:84%
How are you now
building that bridge

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.893 align:middle line:84%
to get this body of
knowledge out to the world?

00:38:06.893 --> 00:38:08.560 align:middle line:84%
I know you've been
doing it for a while.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But what are you working
on right now for people?

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just putting
together a talk.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.200 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned earlier, there's the
Academy of Integrative Health

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.000 align:middle line:90%
and Medicine.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's an academy that's
been trying to really integrate

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:23.200 align:middle line:84%
into a more holistic way the
biomedical allopathic model

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.500 align:middle line:84%
with the whole person
transcendent model.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to be giving
a talk on the topic

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:34.780 align:middle line:84%
of integrative health
and non-dual awareness.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So my current focus,
really, is to help

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.940 align:middle line:84%
introduce this
concept more and more

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.000 align:middle line:84%
into the integrative space, and
try to just soften things up

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.320 align:middle line:84%
so this can begin to be
understood a bit more

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.820 align:middle line:84%
and have some discussions
because right now in medicine,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:52.630 align:middle line:84%
things like
self-realization, these

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.830 align:middle line:90%
are not concepts that exist.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
But I think the
time is ripe for it.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And it might help us transition
to a new level of wellness

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:06.190 align:middle line:84%
and how we look at the
human being in medicine.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you believe
your greatest contribution

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to well-being, to the
world's well-being is?

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And what could that
contribution be

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:18.180 align:middle line:84%
if you were able to
put it into some words?

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:84%
The biggest impact you feel your
work has been able to provide.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned
earlier, yes, I've

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.800 align:middle line:84%
published a few hundred
scientific papers in lots

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.520 align:middle line:84%
of areas-- stress, hypertension,
the psychoneuroimmunology,

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.330 align:middle line:84%
stress hormones, all kinds
of behavioral intervention

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.620 align:middle line:90%
techniques, so many things.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:41.700 align:middle line:84%
But I would say the most
important contribution

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:43.920 align:middle line:84%
for me is what I'm
doing right now,

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.990 align:middle line:84%
is what we've been
speaking about today,

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:49.080 align:middle line:84%
and what I'll speak at
the AHM Conference on.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to help bring into
the conversation of medicine

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:84%
the transcendent spiritual
nature of the human being.

00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.910 align:middle line:84%
In ancient societies
such as Greece,

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:04.380 align:middle line:84%
there wasn't a physician
here and a priest here.

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.260 align:middle line:90%
They were physician priests.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.360 align:middle line:84%
When we were in Tibet,
most of the monks

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.730 align:middle line:84%
are also physicians
because they're

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:15.420 align:middle line:84%
treating the entire integrated
person, from the consciousness

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.590 align:middle line:84%
all through whatever the malady,
and joint pain, whatever it is.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.860 align:middle line:84%
So we lost that because
of this reductionist model

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that you referred to earlier
when we were chatting.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that basic
false split of reductionism

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.780 align:middle line:90%
in medicine needs to be healed.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:35.492 align:middle line:84%
And as much as I can
help a little bit

00:40:35.492 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:84%
with some of these
type of conversations,

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.310 align:middle line:90%
then I'll feel fulfilled.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
concepts or ideas

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.120 align:middle line:84%
of what your future
work might bring

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:48.400 align:middle line:84%
to start bringing together
the transcendental aspects,

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.220 align:middle line:90%
basically, of your whole person?

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.787 align:middle line:84%
Even if it's just a
hope for something

00:40:53.787 --> 00:40:55.620 align:middle line:84%
that you would like to
build in the face of,

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:59.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, booming technology
and interconnectedness

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:00.100 align:middle line:90%
between people.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.058 align:middle line:90%
What are your thoughts?

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:03.142 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of the work
we're doing with the Chopra

00:41:03.142 --> 00:41:04.560 align:middle line:84%
Foundation on
Ayurvedic medicine,

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.970 align:middle line:90%
we're going to continue that.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
whole person medicine

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:09.540 align:middle line:84%
from the Ayurvedic
point of view.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're able to show
that when people delve

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.240 align:middle line:84%
into these practices
and programs,

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.750 align:middle line:84%
it begins to cultivate a
sense of non-verbal awareness

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.100 align:middle line:90%
automatically.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.740 align:middle line:84%
It automatically
helps support them

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:28.200 align:middle line:84%
able to begin to move away
from this egoic role identity

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and move into a sense
of connectedness.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.300 align:middle line:84%
So I want to continue
that work because it

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.090 align:middle line:84%
can have an impact on the
scientific literature and maybe

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:37.710 align:middle line:90%
how things are going.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big piece for me.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think now, with the
advent of the internet and how

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:48.240 align:middle line:84%
connected we are today, this
is part of integrative medicine

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.260 align:middle line:90%
for, maybe, the world?

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.560 align:middle line:84%
People are now being switched
on to ideas that, in the past,

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.870 align:middle line:84%
it was only the
literate and only,

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.720 align:middle line:84%
let's say, a rare few that
were able to even come

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.565 align:middle line:84%
into contact with
some of these concepts

00:41:59.565 --> 00:42:00.690 align:middle line:90%
that you're speaking about?

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like
the time is ripe now

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.030 align:middle line:90%
for integrative medicine?

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.648 align:middle line:84%
And I appreciate
what you're saying

00:42:06.648 --> 00:42:09.280 align:middle line:84%
about the web, and
the advancement

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and the dissemination
of knowledge.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm beginning to learn more
and more about the capabilities

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.460 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
Certainly Deepak has been
utilizing it very well

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:20.610 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years,
disseminating his ideas

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:21.670 align:middle line:90%
and knowledge.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:25.380 align:middle line:84%
So if we can continue to
use that platform for that.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.410 align:middle line:84%
What you're saying,
technology, reminds me earlier

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.180 align:middle line:90%
we spoke of the biofield.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And if somebody can
come up with the idea

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:36.960 align:middle line:84%
or fund an intensive research
program to develop a technology

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.910 align:middle line:90%
to visualize this.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:39.750 align:middle line:90%
We have x-rays.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.160 align:middle line:90%
We have FMRIs.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anything
yet for the biofield.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And that will be a
fundamental game changer.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're also working
with some people on that.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.003 align:middle line:84%
This might be a
little left of center,

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:58.920 align:middle line:84%
but since we're speaking about
technology, the internet, most

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:02.850 align:middle line:84%
people, their connection with
it is hunched over in a chair,

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:05.160 align:middle line:84%
hands literally
touching a computer

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.110 align:middle line:84%
with this energetic field
around it, with a lot of EMFs.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So when we're speaking
about health in particular,

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:17.370 align:middle line:84%
do you have any concepts on,
maybe, how-- because I know

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:19.027 align:middle line:84%
you said you've gotten
into glyphosates

00:43:19.027 --> 00:43:20.110 align:middle line:90%
and those types of things.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:84%
But as far as EMFs and
technology, as great as great

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.480 align:middle line:84%
as it is that we are being
connected with people

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.440 align:middle line:84%
around the world
in real time, there

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:35.160 align:middle line:84%
is still the very real
sedentary lifestyle, and also

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.650 align:middle line:90%
constantly hands-on technology.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:43.200 align:middle line:84%
There's, I think, a quintillion
times more EMFs present today

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:84%
than our grandparents
had to experience.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:84%
So what are your
thoughts, maybe concerns,

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.160 align:middle line:84%
revolving around this great
advent of the internet,

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.410 align:middle line:84%
but the technologies
that our bodies are now

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.140 align:middle line:90%
having to somehow adapt to?

00:43:57.140 --> 00:43:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.970 align:middle line:90%
So a couple of things.

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.350 align:middle line:90%
One on the posture side.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So at UC San Diego, we have a
division of behavioral medicine

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.750 align:middle line:90%
of which I'm the chief of.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And there are many faculty
within that system working

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:10.740 align:middle line:90%
on this.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And they just do research
showing on how adverse it is,

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and they provide
specific recommendations

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:18.390 align:middle line:84%
of what to do if you're
at your computer too long.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And get up and take a
walk, certain stretches.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So they've been working
actively on that side,

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.070 align:middle line:90%
just the mechanics, let's say.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.630 align:middle line:84%
On the side of the EMFs,
it's not an area of research,

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:90%
but I do have concerns.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:34.860 align:middle line:84%
I read articles by people who
are delving into this more.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.677 align:middle line:84%
I know that--did you
just mention the 5G,

00:44:36.677 --> 00:44:38.010 align:middle line:90%
or was I just thinking about it?

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.180 align:middle line:90%
But that's on its way in,

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That's being rolled
out at an incredible pace.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.120 align:middle line:84%
And yes, that is something
we need to at least consider

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:90%
among all these things.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So a big player in all
that is Qualcomm Corporation.

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.400 align:middle line:90%
They're based in San Diego.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.940 align:middle line:84%
I was at a party, dinner
party, maybe a year and a half

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.680 align:middle line:84%
ago, speaking to one
of their engineers.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And he was telling me
that we're so excited.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.652 align:middle line:90%
We almost have the five G set.

00:44:59.652 --> 00:45:01.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
rolling this out,

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:03.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to
transform how fast you can

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.160 align:middle line:90%
watch your movies and all this.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And I said, in your
research programs,

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.170 align:middle line:84%
do you study how it
influences human beings,

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:14.010 align:middle line:84%
whether it's inflammatory
peptides or their mood or--

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:14.810 align:middle line:90%
he said no.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:17.740 align:middle line:90%
No, we can't do that.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:84%
We need to get
this on the market.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.980 align:middle line:90%
That's the role.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So this reminds me,
back to the glyphosate,

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.560 align:middle line:84%
there's so many
pieces from industry,

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.790 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the ag industry
or the electronics industry.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.030 align:middle line:84%
They're not vetting
these technologies

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:35.100 align:middle line:90%
for our health and well-being.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.870 align:middle line:84%
The only thing we
have close to that

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:38.610 align:middle line:84%
is the pharmaceutical
industries,

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.680 align:middle line:84%
which I've worked in as
far as doing research

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:44.050 align:middle line:84%
on, say, anti-hypertensive
drugs and these sorts of things.

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:46.635 align:middle line:84%
They're at least
vetted in human beings.

00:45:46.635 --> 00:45:48.510 align:middle line:84%
It starts with animals,
moves through humans,

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.150 align:middle line:90%
clinical trials, phases 1, 2, 3.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.380 align:middle line:90%
And then they're prescribed.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And they're prescribed with
the knowledge that look,

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.560 align:middle line:84%
this is going to lower
your blood pressure,

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.010 align:middle line:84%
but it also might make you
depressed once in a while.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Your choice, but you
know the adverse effects.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We have not had
that in the field

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.150 align:middle line:90%
of agriculture and herbicides.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:07.530 align:middle line:84%
We have not had that
in the field of EMFs,

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.690 align:middle line:84%
and probably other technologies
I don't even know about.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I believe there
are consequences.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:15.730 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have
hard data on it.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And so in telecommunications
companies, it's huge.

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:25.710 align:middle line:84%
In respect to big ag, big
pharma, telecommunications,

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:26.820 align:middle line:90%
it's huge.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.610 align:middle line:90%
And I totally agree.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.318 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking
about integrative,

00:46:30.318 --> 00:46:31.985 align:middle line:84%
so we're talking about
the whole person.

00:46:31.985 --> 00:46:33.080 align:middle line:90%
But the whole person--

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.580 align:middle line:84%
can we even look
at the whole person

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.030 align:middle line:84%
if we're not looking
at the environment

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.140 align:middle line:90%
that we're involved in?

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And what are these
technologies and glyphosates

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and all these things also doing
to the environment around us?

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.720 align:middle line:84%
I've heard many
things as far as trees

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.140 align:middle line:84%
in Holland, old trees being
wiped out because they're

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:55.410 align:middle line:84%
disrupting the 5G and
other issues such as even

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.090 align:middle line:90%
migration patterns of birds.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of it is
too new to really

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.380 align:middle line:90%
put the stamp of evidence on.

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.895 align:middle line:84%
But I guess the question
to you is, then,

00:47:03.895 --> 00:47:05.520 align:middle line:84%
when we're looking
at the whole person,

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.770 align:middle line:84%
to wrap this whole
conversation up,

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.190 align:middle line:84%
can we really even
understand the whole person

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:12.960 align:middle line:84%
without understanding
the environment

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.027 align:middle line:90%
that they're swimming in?

00:47:15.027 --> 00:47:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So first of all,
Ben, I really appreciate

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.930 align:middle line:84%
your perspective coming
back to the big picture,

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.220 align:middle line:90%
big picture in the environment.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.890 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for that.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.980 align:middle line:90%
And my answer is no.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:28.530 align:middle line:84%
We can't really consider
the whole person.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.660 align:middle line:84%
Some of Deepak's lectures
from a couple of years

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:34.310 align:middle line:84%
ago, he was emphasizing that
our bodies don't end here.

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Certainly we have the
biofield saying maybe

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.460 align:middle line:84%
they end out about
three or four feet.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But the environment itself, the
air, the water, the trees, all

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.760 align:middle line:84%
of this is our own
body environment.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And to the degree that we're
not nurturing and cultivating

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.550 align:middle line:84%
the health and
well-being of all that,

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:54.510 align:middle line:84%
then we cannot be fully healthy
and of total well-being as we

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:55.810 align:middle line:90%
would want.

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.950 align:middle line:84%
So I hope you and your
show, as it unfolds,

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:02.490 align:middle line:84%
can begin to have some of these
conversations of what's really

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.020 align:middle line:84%
going on in the
environment, and how

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.330 align:middle line:84%
we as people who live
in it, whether it's

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:10.530 align:middle line:84%
the EMFs or other herbicides,
we can raise awareness

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and we can find out how to
protect ourselves where needed.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.230 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for that.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.660 align:middle line:84%
If you were to leave our
audience with just one

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:84%
piece of advice
to help them even

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.640 align:middle line:84%
just in their journey
towards understanding

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:26.370 align:middle line:84%
health, well-being,
if you had to leave

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:30.700 align:middle line:84%
with some kind of lasting words
of wisdom, what would that be?

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say just to know that
you are more than you believe

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:37.740 align:middle line:90%
yourself to be.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:42.180 align:middle line:10%
And follow whatever impulses,
whether it's some friend

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.710 align:middle line:10%
recommends this book,
or a conversation here.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.780 align:middle line:10%
But keep yourself open to
conversations and sources

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.620 align:middle line:10%
of information that
might help you provide

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:56.250 align:middle line:10%
a step along this journey of
unfolding that a little bit

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:58.440 align:middle line:10%
more, and then a
little bit more.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So this reminds me of your
show on the limitless,

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and those episodes where
you're encouraging people

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.170 align:middle line:90%
to take a step.

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.462 align:middle line:84%
Cross this threshold that
you don't think you can.

00:49:09.462 --> 00:49:11.545 align:middle line:84%
And once you've crossed
it and you're comfortable,

00:49:11.545 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:90%
cross the next one.

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Stay open because
we are so much more

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:20.950 align:middle line:84%
than we know ourselves to be
and is capable to know that.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> That's very true.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.817 align:middle line:84%
Paul, thank you so much for
joining us on the show today.

00:49:24.817 --> 00:49:26.150 align:middle line:90%
