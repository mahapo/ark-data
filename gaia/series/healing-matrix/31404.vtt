00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.702 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad you could
join us here.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.004 align:middle line:84%
You're getting some
real [inaudible].

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:40.707 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people are really
drawn to the messages you have.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them have to
do with health and some

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.379 align:middle line:84%
of them are more politically
motivated and active --

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.216 align:middle line:84%
you're calling for activism
and we're really going

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.419 align:middle line:84%
to start looking at that zone
in-between where all of us need

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:55.288 align:middle line:84%
to start considering what we
need to do to take action on.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.957 align:middle line:90%
And we're talking Monsanto;

00:00:56.957 --> 00:00:59.092 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
talking transhumanism.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.161 align:middle line:84%
These are subjects most people
have never even heard of.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.396 align:middle line:84%
Well, Monsanto, but
not transhumanism.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.466 align:middle line:84%
Scary stuff, but also
things that we can --

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.336 align:middle line:84%
there are things we can do to
avoid that kind of an outcome.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.805 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I wanted
to meet with you.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.374 align:middle line:84%
First of all, give us
an idea of who you are.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
I love the fact that your
generation, which is younger

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.547 align:middle line:84%
than my generation, is now
totally hopping on all of this.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.149 align:middle line:90%
What was your entry point?

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.451 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So I think it all
started when I was diagnosed

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.821 align:middle line:84%
with Lyme disease, and I went to
my doctor and we did some tests.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.056 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out I
did have Lyme disease.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.825 align:middle line:90%
And he put me on steroids.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.895 align:middle line:84%
He actually didn't even give
me antibiotics at the time.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.397 align:middle line:84%
So I think the real turning
point was when I sent to sleep

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.034 align:middle line:84%
at 5:00 p.m. and I woke up
at 5:00 p.m. the next day.

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.737 align:middle line:84%
Wow. And I went to my doctor and
I said, "Something's wrong here.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:44.938 align:middle line:90%
This is not working.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.407 align:middle line:84%
The steroids you're giving
me, they're ruining me.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:50.510 align:middle line:84%
I feel worse than just
the Lyme disease itself."

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.779 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "Well, you know,
there's some things we can do.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.148 align:middle line:84%
Let me increase the
dosage of the steroids.

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you some
pain medication,"

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.652 align:middle line:90%
you know, etcetera, etcetera.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:01:59.452 align:middle line:90%
So I said, "You know what?

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.487 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.688 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to start
researching myself."

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.724 align:middle line:84%
I went online and this
was about seven years ago.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
So I couldn't just type
into, you know, natural cures

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.063 align:middle line:84%
for Lyme disease and get great
results on Google or anything.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.265 align:middle line:84%
Right. I actually had
to do days of research

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.534 align:middle line:90%
to find legitimate information.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:16.937 align:middle line:84%
So I found colloidal
silver, oregano oil.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:20.574 align:middle line:84%
I started taking these things
against the advice of my doctor

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.709 align:middle line:84%
who told me I would turn
blue [laughter] if I were

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.145 align:middle line:84%
to take even a drop
of colloidal silver.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:90%
And that oil of oregano was

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.449 align:middle line:84%
so dangerous it could
give me a heart attack.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.751 align:middle line:90%
So... Under informed.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:32.452 align:middle line:90%
Yes, exactly.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.453 align:middle line:90%
He had no idea.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.122 align:middle line:84%
He's a Harvard educated
doctor, as well.

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.958 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead and I
took some colloidal silver

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.426 align:middle line:90%
and oil of oregano.

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:42.829 align:middle line:84%
And the next day I literally
felt completely better.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.965 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the doctor and
I told him what happened

00:02:44.965 --> 00:02:47.901 align:middle line:84%
and he told me not
only is it impossible

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.403 align:middle line:84%
that the natural
solutions, colloidal silver ,

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:53.073 align:middle line:84%
oil of oregano, everything I
was doing, life-style changes,

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:56.509 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible they actually
changed my health and also,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.713 align:middle line:84%
it was most likely a placebo
effect and that I was crazy.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:00.814 align:middle line:90%
Basically he told me.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:01.881 align:middle line:84%
He told me that it's
impossible --

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:05.118 align:middle line:84%
or it's a highly
interesting coincidence

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.754 align:middle line:84%
that the steroids decided to
kick in around the same time

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:09.155 align:middle line:90%
that I took that stuff.

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:12.092 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Isn't it interesting how
those coincidences start rising

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:90%
in number, you know.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.929 align:middle line:84%
And then that really -- I think
that's a good starting place

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.030 align:middle line:90%
for most people, too --

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.132 align:middle line:84%
where you've gone to
a well-educated doctor

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.435 align:middle line:84%
of some kind and I'm not trying
to demonize the industry.

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:23.703 align:middle line:90%
They know what they know.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:25.538 align:middle line:84%
Great for trauma and
things like that,

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:26.773 align:middle line:90%
not for chronic ill health.

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.476 align:middle line:84%
Lyme disease is a
particularly tough one.

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.311 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that you
got on the path then --

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.813 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like you never got
off the path and you have a lot

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:36.049 align:middle line:84%
of people subscribing
to your site now.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.384 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. I'm really
grateful for that.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:40.353 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what happened was I
said, "If I can do this" --

00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:42.822 align:middle line:84%
and I started researching other
people doing the same thing.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.591 align:middle line:90%
People need to know about this.

00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:46.492 align:middle line:84%
And about seven years
ago, around that time,

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:47.827 align:middle line:90%
not a lot of people did know.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean there were some major
sites and I started writing

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.632 align:middle line:84%
for alternative news websites
about what was going on

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.567 align:middle line:84%
and my story and
everything like that.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And people started responding
so well I started my own site.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.572 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm really
grateful to all the readers.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.174 align:middle line:84%
It's the third largest
natural health site

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:03.510 align:middle line:84%
in the world,
naturalsociety.com.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.145 align:middle line:90%
And I get to help everybody.

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:07.113 align:middle line:84%
In Google now, if you
type in natural cures

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:10.283 align:middle line:84%
for random diseases, sometimes
our site will come up or,

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:11.651 align:middle line:84%
you know, there's a bunch
of other great sites

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
out there now -- that you
can get answers right away.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.855 align:middle line:84%
Right. So we see millions
every single day turning

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:20.694 align:middle line:84%
to these alternative therapies
that are way more beneficial.

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:22.462 align:middle line:84%
And you're right
about something, too.

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.997 align:middle line:90%
It's not all doctors.

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.566 align:middle line:84%
For example, I know Dr.
Group of Glenway Center.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.300 align:middle line:90%
Right. He's an excellent doctor.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.501 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.937 align:middle line:84%
Well educated, knows
everything that's going on.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.505 align:middle line:84%
But then there's a lot
of mainstream doctors

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.641 align:middle line:84%
that I think they conceal
themselves from what's going

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.077 align:middle line:84%
on because they have this
certain bias that they need

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:38.078 align:middle line:90%
to be in control of everything.

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.612 align:middle line:84%
They need to know
what's going on.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.147 align:middle line:84%
And there's no such
thing as a cure to them.

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:44.184 align:middle line:84%
And that false ideology
prevents them

00:04:44.184 --> 00:04:46.019 align:middle line:84%
from exploring alternative
options

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.355 align:middle line:84%
that are way more
beneficial and even admitting

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
that certain studies
exist, like the 28 studies

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.559 align:middle line:90%
on PubMed Peer Reviewed Research

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.128 align:middle line:84%
that Roundup is causing
everything from lymphoma

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:57.030 align:middle line:90%
to DNA damage and cancer.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.265 align:middle line:84%
So they just like to single
out studies and say, "Oh,

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:00.667 align:middle line:90%
those other studies don't exist.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.168 align:middle line:90%
Those don't matter."

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.570 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.875 align:middle line:84%
I mean -- and in reality those
doctors are also under pressure

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:12.011 align:middle line:84%
from the HMOs, from the
insurance companies,

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.314 align:middle line:84%
and I just want to put
that out because, you know,

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.383 align:middle line:84%
most people that go
into the profession --

00:05:16.383 --> 00:05:17.984 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a good percentage
of the people that go

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:21.054 align:middle line:84%
into that profession are doing
it because they want to be

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.055 align:middle line:90%
of some kind of service.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.523 align:middle line:90%
Some are in it just for bucks.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:25.091 align:middle line:90%
But some want to be of service.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.694 align:middle line:84%
But it's like any other industry
including the news industry

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:28.928 align:middle line:90%
and the information industry

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.830 align:middle line:84%
which I've been in
my entire life.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.268 align:middle line:84%
You find the harsh realities
pretty quickly which is, oh,

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.337 align:middle line:84%
you think you're going
to have some control

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.872 align:middle line:90%
over this situation?

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:41.174 align:middle line:84%
Mm-mm-mm. You have other
people to answer to.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:44.644 align:middle line:84%
And that's when a lot
of these amazing people

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:47.747 align:middle line:84%
in the medical industry
have chosen to jump ship,

00:05:47.747 --> 00:05:50.382 align:middle line:84%
and take on new levels
of training and go

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:51.785 align:middle line:90%
into new healthier directions.

00:05:51.785 --> 00:05:55.755 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them I've interviewed
and I have the deepest respect

00:05:55.755 --> 00:05:57.891 align:middle line:84%
for those who have
had the courage

00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:59.225 align:middle line:90%
because that's a loss of income.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.427 align:middle line:90%
That's a loss of face.

00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:02.762 align:middle line:84%
That's a loss of your
license even sometimes.

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:04.063 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:06.599 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And I actually know a
doctor that was in college

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.270 align:middle line:84%
and he was in college as --
going to be a medical doctor

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.174 align:middle line:84%
and his peers -- he said that
most of them, not all of them...

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...most of them were
in it either for the money

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.445 align:middle line:90%
or they were power tripping.

00:06:18.445 --> 00:06:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, that's true,
too, that you go part.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.981 align:middle line:90%
And it's really concerning.

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.616 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. So he said, "Hey,
I'm getting out of this."

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.418 align:middle line:84%
He's still a doctor
today, but he decided

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:27.720 align:middle line:84%
to pursue a doctorate
in another area.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.022 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Well, good.

00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:31.357 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so you figured this
out at a really young age.

00:06:31.357 --> 00:06:34.627 align:middle line:84%
So you got on with it and you're
a really crack on researcher.

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:35.962 align:middle line:90%
I respect your research.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:37.163 align:middle line:90%
And one of the things

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:40.400 align:middle line:84%
that you've researched a
lot is GMOs and Monsanto.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.836 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, we hear about
it, we read the headlines.

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:45.238 align:middle line:84%
The Supreme Court decides this
or that, which you can fill us

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.439 align:middle line:90%
in on as a matter of fact.

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:90%
That just happened.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.944 align:middle line:84%
And we become inured to it
as a species in general.

00:06:50.944 --> 00:06:53.546 align:middle line:84%
I mean certainly -- I
think most of the culture

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:56.249 align:middle line:84%
of the United States has
become somewhat inured to it,

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
although if you ask them
whether they, you know,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
support what Monsanto's doing
-- you know, the stats on that.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.124 align:middle line:90%
What are they going to say?

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:06.392 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely not.

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:10.430 align:middle line:84%
Right. And yet to do anything
about it is so confusing

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.765 align:middle line:84%
and takes so much trouble
to read every label,

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:15.735 align:middle line:84%
so let's launch into
what's happening

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:18.271 align:middle line:84%
with Monsanto right now and
also what happened yesterday

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.205 align:middle line:90%
at the Supreme Court.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.273 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.642 align:middle line:84%
So Monsanto is an
example of a corporation

00:07:22.642 --> 00:07:24.677 align:middle line:84%
that pretty much
everyone hates whether

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:84%
or not they even support
GMOs in the first place,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.381 align:middle line:90%
which most people do not.

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.618 align:middle line:84%
And over 90% are in favor
of at least GMO labeling...

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:33.253 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm. ...let alone a ban.

00:07:33.253 --> 00:07:36.122 align:middle line:84%
But Monsanto -- there's
an interesting fact

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.392 align:middle line:84%
about that corporation, and
it's that so many people hate it

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.361 align:middle line:84%
yet they ultimately give
up because they feel

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.729 align:middle line:90%
like they're so low in number.

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.098 align:middle line:84%
Yes. In reality it's
the general public.

00:07:45.098 --> 00:07:48.067 align:middle line:84%
What we're seeing a mass
awakening, a mass movement

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.470 align:middle line:84%
with things like the
March Against Monsanto

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.072 align:middle line:84%
which is taking place this
month around the world.

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:54.374 align:middle line:90%
And it's grassroots --

00:07:54.374 --> 00:07:57.143 align:middle line:84%
what I would call open source
initiatives like that --

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:59.312 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
ultimately be the final nail

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.048 align:middle line:90%
in the coffin against Monsanto.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.851 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing people now
coming out and saying, "Hey,

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.954 align:middle line:84%
you know, it's not just you
guys that hate Monsanto and want

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:10.089 align:middle line:84%
to see these, you
know, GMOs eradicated

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:13.126 align:middle line:84%
from the United States and
the entire world at large."

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.061 align:middle line:84%
Now we're seeing
grassroots initiatives

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.764 align:middle line:84%
that are opening this up
into a whole new ballgame.

00:08:17.764 --> 00:08:19.832 align:middle line:84%
And I believe ultimately
it is the beginning

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.167 align:middle line:90%
of the end for Monsanto.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:24.804 align:middle line:84%
Right now as we sit here we're
seeing a protest mobilize

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.072 align:middle line:90%
across the world.

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.007 align:middle line:84%
Yet people are so disheartened
when they read the news

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:29.909 align:middle line:84%
that the Court is
siding with them.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.644 align:middle line:84%
For example, talk about
what happened there.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.378 align:middle line:90%
Right. So the Supreme Court,

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:37.784 align:middle line:84%
despite as the  USA Today  says
clearly, despite usually siding

00:08:37.784 --> 00:08:41.955 align:middle line:84%
with citizens over patent cases
that are considered ridiculous,

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:44.624 align:middle line:84%
the Supreme Court has
sided with Monsanto saying

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:46.859 align:middle line:84%
that farmers cannot
replant their GMO seeds

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.394 align:middle line:90%
without paying a fee.

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:50.029 align:middle line:84%
So, traditionally, you
can plant, you know,

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.465 align:middle line:84%
regular traditional seeds over
and over again, and not have

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:55.568 align:middle line:84%
to pay anybody because, you
know, who owns the seeds?

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:59.305 align:middle line:84%
Not you. But Monsanto has
been able to patent life --

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:01.874 align:middle line:90%
as India calls it bio-piracy.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:04.077 align:middle line:84%
So the point is now
that they can say, "Hey,

00:09:04.077 --> 00:09:05.478 align:middle line:90%
those seeds that we gave you?

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:08.047 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you have to pay us every
single time you replant them."

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.148 align:middle line:90%
You can't save any money.

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:10.984 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
what's known as the

00:09:10.984 --> 00:09:12.352 align:middle line:90%
"suicide belts in India"...

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:13.553 align:middle line:90%
I was just going to ask...

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:15.855 align:middle line:84%
...where Indian farmers
are drinking the very same

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.591 align:middle line:84%
bio-pesticides that Monsanto
gives them and we see

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.195 align:middle line:84%
about one suicide every
30 minutes because they go

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:24.564 align:middle line:84%
into complete financial
bankruptcy

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.399 align:middle line:90%
because the Monsanto crops --

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:29.869 align:middle line:84%
the Monsanto seeds actually
produced reduced yields.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.371 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So they go in and
they say, "You're going

00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:32.472 align:middle line:90%
to make so much money.

00:09:32.472 --> 00:09:33.940 align:middle line:84%
You're going to make
so much more, you know,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.242 align:middle line:90%
revenue and crop profit."

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:39.112 align:middle line:84%
And they buy it because they
hardly speak English sometimes

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:40.213 align:middle line:90%
and they'll sign off on things.

00:09:40.213 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a complete scam.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.315 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a total scam and
you're talking about people

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.654 align:middle line:84%
who are living so close to
the margin anyway of survival

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:51.124 align:middle line:84%
that they can't afford for one
year's crop to have low yields

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:53.026 align:middle line:90%
and then have to buy new seeds.

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:56.663 align:middle line:84%
And this was also a company
that got raided in Argentina,

00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:57.630 align:middle line:90%
if you've heard about that...

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.532 align:middle line:90%
Yes. ...for the slave labor.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.833 align:middle line:90%
They had people working

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:04.971 align:middle line:84%
for 14 hours milling
the GMO cornfields.

00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:08.841 align:middle line:84%
And not only were they not paid
if they left the reservation --

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:12.512 align:middle line:84%
if you will, but they had to
use their profits to buy food

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.747 align:middle line:90%
at the Monsanto Company Store.

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:16.516 align:middle line:90%
So it's a complete slave grid.

00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:18.885 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about a
company that does this openly

00:10:18.885 --> 00:10:21.654 align:middle line:84%
and didn't care,
didn't apologize.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:24.457 align:middle line:84%
They created Agent Orange which
killed hundreds of thousands

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
and led to 500,000 plus
birth defects along

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.896 align:middle line:84%
with Dow AgroSciences --
which we can talk about...

00:10:29.896 --> 00:10:30.663 align:middle line:90%
We are, yeah.

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:31.731 align:middle line:90%
...and DuPont.

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:33.132 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that
this is a company

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:34.434 align:middle line:84%
that does not care
about your health.

00:10:34.434 --> 00:10:36.069 align:middle line:90%
They don't care about you.

00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:38.471 align:middle line:84%
But what kind of pressure
must have been exerted

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.541 align:middle line:84%
to make the Supreme
Court rule in this way?

00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:45.345 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking about
unfathomable levels of clout

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:48.047 align:middle line:84%
on one level, which is
why people feel defeated

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.482 align:middle line:90%
in the face of it.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.883 align:middle line:90%
What kind of clout?

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:53.419 align:middle line:84%
How did, you know, how can you
manipulate in such a large way?

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.621 align:middle line:84%
Of course we're getting
back to the big agenda.

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think there's
a major difference

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.725 align:middle line:84%
between the public,
me and you...

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:01.394 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...and the small
group of politicians

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:02.795 align:middle line:84%
who are stuffing
their pockets...

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...with Monsanto
funding.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.766 align:middle line:84%
Look at Clarence Thomas,
Supreme Court Justice.

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Guess who he used to work for?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.002 align:middle line:90%
Monsanto, as their main lawyer.

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:12.572 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. And now he's a
Supreme Court Justice.

00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:15.375 align:middle line:84%
Some news organizations called
it "Monsanto gets a seat

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:16.342 align:middle line:90%
at the Supreme Court."

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:90%
And I would agree with that.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.711 align:middle line:90%
Monsanto has a seat.

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:19.846 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.214 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't step out for
every vote on Monsanto.

00:11:21.214 --> 00:11:24.050 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't proclaim to
have any affiliations

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.486 align:middle line:84%
with them despite being
a former employee.

00:11:26.486 --> 00:11:27.987 align:middle line:90%
And he always votes for them.

00:11:27.987 --> 00:11:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But it still -- it takes more
than him -- meaning somehow,

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.992 align:middle line:84%
somewhere, these other guys have
been pressured or gotten to,

00:11:32.992 --> 00:11:35.528 align:middle line:84%
because no one with a
brain would vote for that.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.597 align:middle line:84%
Well that's the only obvious
connection to Monsanto...

00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:39.364 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...that we have,
but you know --

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:41.934 align:middle line:84%
I mean, behind the scenes with
the Monsanto Protection Act...

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:42.935 align:middle line:90%
Yes. ...which gives Monsanto...

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Talk about that.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.539 align:middle line:84%
...complete immunity
from Federal Courts.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:50.643 align:middle line:84%
So if Monsanto were to go out
and plant a thousand acres

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.145 align:middle line:90%
of a crop that unanimously

00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:56.249 align:middle line:84%
through every single scientific
study has been causing,

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:58.751 align:middle line:84%
you know, birth defects or
literally killing people,

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.419 align:middle line:84%
the Federal Courts couldn't
do anything about it

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:01.621 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:04.357 align:middle line:84%
So what is the public
rationalization for that?

00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:05.158 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're at a...

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:06.392 align:middle line:90%
For giving them protection.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.294 align:middle line:84%
What -- I mean, how did
they -- because I didn't it.

00:12:08.294 --> 00:12:09.796 align:middle line:90%
I have not read it.

00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:12.732 align:middle line:84%
So I've only read about it
and the ramifications of it.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.567 align:middle line:84%
How did they justify
this to the public?

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.836 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much all the
Senators apologized for it,

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:18.271 align:middle line:90%
including the female Senator

00:12:18.271 --> 00:12:20.706 align:middle line:84%
who ultimately ended
up passing the bill.

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:22.942 align:middle line:84%
She said that if she didn't pass
it there would be a government

00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.944 align:middle line:84%
shutdown because it was
included -- a rider --

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:26.145 align:middle line:90%
this is how they do it.

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:28.247 align:middle line:84%
They're going to look for
dangerous legislation --

00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.650 align:middle line:84%
it's always in a bill
that everyone likes,

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.784 align:middle line:84%
and they stuff it
in there as a rider.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:32.418 align:middle line:90%
Oh, as a rider.

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.553 align:middle line:90%
It's a rider.

00:12:33.553 --> 00:12:35.354 align:middle line:84%
Yep, yep. So it was a
Senate spending bill,

00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:37.757 align:middle line:84%
and inside there -- it has
nothing to do with Monsanto.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.192 align:middle line:84%
It was talking about
budgets and everything.

00:12:39.192 --> 00:12:41.294 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and by the way, Monsanto
gets complete immunity

00:12:41.294 --> 00:12:42.662 align:middle line:90%
from all Federal Courts.

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:43.729 align:middle line:90%
So, the...

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.298 align:middle line:84%
Smart. I mean, from
their point of view,

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:46.499 align:middle line:90%
what a smart thing to do.

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:47.800 align:middle line:90%
Extremely smart.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.636 align:middle line:84%
And they had the guy, Roy
Blunt, Senator Roy Blunt...

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.138 align:middle line:90%
Yes. ...write it for them.

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.173 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. And he was
receiving massive amounts

00:12:54.173 --> 00:12:55.675 align:middle line:90%
of cash from Monsanto.

00:12:55.675 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And how is
that possibly legal?

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.245 align:middle line:90%
But Monsanto is above the law.

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.247 align:middle line:84%
Yes. They've done it
time and time again.

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.315 align:middle line:90%
They pay settlements.

00:13:02.315 --> 00:13:04.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't get tried
for criminal cases.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.053 align:middle line:84%
They get tried civilly
and they have to pay --

00:13:07.053 --> 00:13:10.790 align:middle line:84%
for example, they paid $93
million to the town of Nitro

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.459 align:middle line:84%
which was getting
blasted with dioxin,

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:15.895 align:middle line:84%
one of the most dangerous
substances known to man,

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:18.631 align:middle line:84%
from the production of
Agent Orange in that town.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And they paid off another
Agent Orange settlement.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.868 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:13:21.868 --> 00:13:23.336 align:middle line:84%
None of their executives
go to jail.

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:25.671 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. $93 million
is nothing to them.

00:13:25.671 --> 00:13:28.474 align:middle line:84%
No. I believe they also
hide most of their assets

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:31.344 align:middle line:84%
as any big major company
would do if they want

00:13:31.344 --> 00:13:33.279 align:middle line:84%
to avoid certain
taxes and everything.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:35.848 align:middle line:84%
Probably they don't pay
any taxes, but they want

00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:39.085 align:middle line:84%
to avoid taxation and at
least public scrutiny.

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:40.853 align:middle line:90%
But also consider the fact

00:13:40.853 --> 00:13:45.858 align:middle line:84%
that back during the Prop 37
debate they illegally used an

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:49.161 align:middle line:84%
FDA seal and fabricated
an FDA quote.

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:50.830 align:middle line:90%
And there is a comparable one.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.031 align:middle line:90%
I was on the press call.

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:55.134 align:middle line:84%
I was on the press call
for Prop 37, the campaign.

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.303 align:middle line:84%
And I was on with the  L.A.
Times,  the  New York Times,

00:13:57.303 --> 00:14:00.072 align:middle line:84%
you know, all the -- for that
news agencies and everything,

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.774 align:middle line:84%
and the Prop 37 people
were saying,

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:03.509 align:middle line:90%
"We submitted it to the FBI.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:07.313 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto illegally used an
FDA quote that didn't exist...

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.982 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm. ...and the FDA seal."

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:12.418 align:middle line:84%
And the  L.A. Times
was like, well,

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:14.186 align:middle line:84%
did they really use
it illegally?

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.021 align:middle line:90%
And they -- well, yeah.

00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:16.822 align:middle line:90%
And the FBI's investigating it.

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:19.058 align:middle line:84%
And they said, "Oh, are they
really investigating it?"

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:21.494 align:middle line:84%
They were making the Prop
37 people the bad guys.

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:24.964 align:middle line:84%
Right. I went on and I
said, "Hey, there are people

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:84%
that are being prosecuted
for this same thing."

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.170 align:middle line:84%
And I -- off the top of my head,
I believe it's a $250,000 fine,

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.739 align:middle line:84%
up to 25 years in jail,
and a large amount

00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:35.875 align:middle line:90%
of years of probation.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:37.209 align:middle line:84%
It could be a little
bit different than that

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:40.479 align:middle line:84%
but it is a massive result
of doing something like that.

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.381 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. And there was a woman
who was being tried for it

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:45.618 align:middle line:84%
at the exact same time that
Monsanto was doing it by ICE

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:47.453 align:middle line:84%
for mail fraud which
is what they did.

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:49.422 align:middle line:84%
They sent out a pamphlet
with this stuff.

00:14:49.422 --> 00:14:51.991 align:middle line:84%
And she was facing massive
amounts of time in prison.

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Yet Monsanto -- nothing
happened.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.829 align:middle line:84%
The FBI didn't even
do anything about it,

00:14:56.829 --> 00:15:00.032 align:middle line:84%
and the press didn't say, "Look,
Monsanto forged an FDA seal

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:01.734 align:middle line:90%
and forged an FDA quote."

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:06.138 align:middle line:84%
They said, "Prop 37 group claims
that Monsanto may have done this

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:08.841 align:middle line:84%
and by the way Prop
37 group is crazy."

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:09.942 align:middle line:84%
That's literally --
basically a summary.

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:11.143 align:middle line:90%
But that's mainstream media.

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:14.046 align:middle line:84%
Yes. I mean this is all a
part of the same handful

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:15.448 align:middle line:90%
of players and agenda.

00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:17.850 align:middle line:84%
They're just the media
arm of the same thing.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.417 align:middle line:90%
Oh, of course.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.819 align:middle line:90%
So we get that.

00:15:19.819 --> 00:15:25.224 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so it's a shame because
mainstream media is still the

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:29.295 align:middle line:84%
primary source for most
people and across the world,

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:32.531 align:middle line:84%
in the Western World
-- probably globally.

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, really the only
way to find these things

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.903 align:middle line:84%
out is people have to come
to know agencies, news --

00:15:37.903 --> 00:15:41.173 align:middle line:84%
the new kind of news agencies
such as yours, and Mike Adams,

00:15:41.173 --> 00:15:43.876 align:middle line:84%
and [inaudible] groups and
a lot of you here in Austin.

00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:46.045 align:middle line:84%
There are others of you
here in Austin, as well.

00:15:46.045 --> 00:15:49.315 align:middle line:84%
But, meanwhile -- okay,
that being what it is,

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.716 align:middle line:84%
let's get into some
of the other players

00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:52.284 align:middle line:84%
because you have just
mentioned DuPont,

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:54.687 align:middle line:84%
and you had mentioned Dow
Chemical a minute ago.

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:56.055 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into what
their involvement is

00:15:56.055 --> 00:15:57.623 align:middle line:84%
because these are not
names you normally hear

00:15:57.623 --> 00:15:59.759 align:middle line:84%
in association with
the GMO issue.

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.060 align:middle line:90%
Sure. So here's something

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.196 align:middle line:84%
that will shock even the
most hardened anti-Monsanto

00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:07.033 align:middle line:84%
activists, and I've talked
about this a little bit before.

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:10.736 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto is just the beginning
of what I would call the GMO

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.072 align:middle line:84%
or Genetic Modification
Paradigm.

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:17.043 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto is literally the
starting point and those

00:16:17.043 --> 00:16:20.913 align:middle line:84%
in the biotech group, those
scientists behind all this,

00:16:20.913 --> 00:16:23.282 align:middle line:84%
they're already way
past the finish line.

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:26.986 align:middle line:84%
They are already creating
genetically modified humans.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.054 align:middle line:90%
They have been busted

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:29.922 align:middle line:84%
for creating genetically
modified chimeras

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:31.557 align:middle line:84%
over in Britain I
believe it was.

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:33.726 align:middle line:84%
They had at least
a couple hundred.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:36.395 align:middle line:84%
There was talks of
thousands of human chimeras.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.531 align:middle line:84%
We're talking spider-goats
-- just Google it.

00:16:38.531 --> 00:16:39.832 align:middle line:90%
It all is real.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:40.633 align:middle line:90%
And they've been busted...

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.367 align:middle line:90%
Spider-goats?

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:42.068 align:middle line:90%
Spider-goats.

00:16:42.068 --> 00:16:42.768 align:middle line:90%
I haven't heard that.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:43.869 align:middle line:90%
What is a spider-goat?

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:45.337 align:middle line:84%
It's a combination of
a spider and a goat.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.605 align:middle line:90%
But I mean -- what kind

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:47.739 align:middle line:84%
of a result would you get
there [multiple speakers]?

00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:48.674 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like a...

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.376 align:middle line:84%
Well, they weave
bulletproof silk,

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:54.246 align:middle line:84%
so the way that they push
all of this through is

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.449 align:middle line:84%
that they talk about
the pros of it.

00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:59.318 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk about
the ultimate end goal

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:00.252 align:middle line:90%
of all of this.

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:01.153 align:middle line:90%
They talk about the pros.

00:17:01.153 --> 00:17:02.555 align:middle line:90%
Just like GMOs, they said," Oh,

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:04.856 align:middle line:84%
it will produce increased
yields for farmers.

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:05.958 align:middle line:90%
It will help save the world."

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:07.493 align:middle line:90%
Right. Bill Gates came out,

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:09.961 align:middle line:84%
owner of 500,000
shares of Monsanto...

00:17:09.961 --> 00:17:11.163 align:middle line:90%
$22 million.

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:13.132 align:middle line:90%
I believe it was $25 million.

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.300 align:middle line:90%
[Laughter] Yep.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.968 align:middle line:84%
And he said that Monsanto
will feed the world.

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:18.903 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and buy their stock
as a major stock owner.

00:17:18.903 --> 00:17:20.605 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. Very disappointing
when that happened.

00:17:20.605 --> 00:17:24.744 align:middle line:84%
But did you know that a United
Nations study, of all things,

00:17:24.744 --> 00:17:27.212 align:middle line:90%
of 900 scientists found

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:29.782 align:middle line:84%
that actually GMOs
cannot feed the world.

00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:31.317 align:middle line:90%
They went out with one goal;

00:17:31.317 --> 00:17:32.551 align:middle line:84%
what's the best way
to feed the world?

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:33.686 align:middle line:90%
That was their only goal.

00:17:33.686 --> 00:17:36.188 align:middle line:84%
900 scientists -- and
they all predetermined

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:38.891 align:middle line:84%
that it's likely going to be
GMOs, you know, that has to --

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.426 align:middle line:90%
the amazing increased yields

00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:43.763 align:middle line:84%
and it produces the time
needed to grow the crops...

00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Pest-resistant.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.731 align:middle line:90%
Guess what they found out?

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:49.168 align:middle line:84%
Mm. Organic traditional
farming outperformed GMOs

00:17:49.168 --> 00:17:50.503 align:middle line:90%
in every single trial.

00:17:50.503 --> 00:17:53.372 align:middle line:84%
And they were forced -- the
wording is they were forced

00:17:53.372 --> 00:17:56.575 align:middle line:84%
to real -- that traditional
farming beat GMOs.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:57.676 align:middle line:90%
They were amazed.

00:17:57.676 --> 00:17:58.711 align:middle line:84%
They could not even
believe it themselves,

00:17:58.711 --> 00:17:59.712 align:middle line:90%
the team of 900 scientists.

00:17:59.712 --> 00:18:00.479 align:middle line:90%
No, that's wonderful.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:01.780 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for sharing that.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So there goes everything out
the window of Bill Gates,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.419 align:middle line:84%
the Monsanto Shareholder,
and Monsanto.

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:09.388 align:middle line:84%
All their claims are
bogus and guess what?

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:12.525 align:middle line:84%
All the claims -- all this
GM manipulation in humans

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:14.560 align:middle line:84%
that they're pushing now,
all that's bogus too,

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.162 align:middle line:90%
but they've pushed the ante.

00:18:16.162 --> 00:18:20.833 align:middle line:84%
Today is it moral to
genetically modify humans?

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:24.236 align:middle line:84%
Right. But we see -- sources
such as RT already have reported

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:27.273 align:middle line:84%
that DARPA is working
on super-humans.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:29.708 align:middle line:84%
They can regrow limbs
on the battlefield

00:18:29.708 --> 00:18:31.577 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
to sleep or eat.

00:18:31.577 --> 00:18:33.646 align:middle line:84%
They're going to push it as,
you know, this is what we need

00:18:33.646 --> 00:18:35.114 align:middle line:90%
to compete with other countries.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:37.583 align:middle line:84%
This is the super-soldier
of the future.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.986 align:middle line:84%
But guess how all of this
is going to be controlled.

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:43.389 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately we can talk
about the 2045 program...

00:18:43.389 --> 00:18:44.623 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I do want
to talk about that.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:45.991 align:middle line:84%
...and everything like
that because it's all going

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:48.661 align:middle line:84%
to a point where
it's disgusting.

00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:51.263 align:middle line:84%
It's a system of
control ultimately,

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.866 align:middle line:84%
that comes down to
artificial bodies.

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.100 align:middle line:90%
It sounds crazy to most people

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.902 align:middle line:84%
because we're looking
at GMOs right now.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:58.704 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. But it's
worlds ahead of that.

00:18:58.704 --> 00:19:00.639 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand that
Monsanto is the beginning.

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:03.275 align:middle line:84%
And if we cannot
conquer Monsanto today,

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:06.779 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow we will have genetic
manipulation gone wild.

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:09.582 align:middle line:84%
Yes, and I do want to
get into Agenda 2045 --

00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:13.586 align:middle line:84%
or 2045 Initiative and
some other aspects of that.

00:19:13.586 --> 00:19:16.522 align:middle line:84%
But, let's go back to Dow
for a moment and DuPont.

00:19:16.522 --> 00:19:17.489 align:middle line:90%
Where do they figure in?

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.024 align:middle line:90%
Where do they factor in?

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.826 align:middle line:90%
Do we talk about that directly?

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:24.396 align:middle line:84%
Yes. So Dow AgroSciences is
another key player that's

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:25.998 align:middle line:90%
getting no flack whatsoever.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:28.934 align:middle line:84%
I mean Monsanto is the
bad guy, and I believe

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:32.204 align:middle line:84%
that within the next five years
or so Monsanto will be taken

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:34.974 align:middle line:84%
down because they're essentially
the fall guy, what you...

00:19:34.974 --> 00:19:36.308 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...would call
the fall guy.

00:19:36.308 --> 00:19:39.712 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be taken
down and the biotech industry

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:42.181 align:middle line:84%
at large won't shed
a single tear

00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:44.216 align:middle line:84%
because we still have
Dow AgroSciences...

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:47.319 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...creating this, you
know, chemtrail-resistant crops

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and everything like that.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.424 align:middle line:84%
And DuPont coming in and
buying up certain factions

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.126 align:middle line:90%
of the biotech industry.

00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:57.563 align:middle line:84%
So these are key players that we
see going in the background --

00:19:57.563 --> 00:19:59.431 align:middle line:90%
mad scientists if you will.

00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:01.800 align:middle line:84%
They're going and going
into their bat caves

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.736 align:middle line:84%
and doing all this kind
of stuff while Monsanto is

00:20:03.736 --> 00:20:04.803 align:middle line:90%
out in the public saying, "Hey,

00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:07.406 align:middle line:84%
we're releasing new
GMO crops tomorrow."

00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:11.810 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's like throwing eggs at
Monsanto when Dow AgroSciences

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:14.113 align:middle line:84%
and everything and DuPont are
in the background just smiling

00:20:14.113 --> 00:20:16.115 align:middle line:84%
because they're getting away
with everything they're doing.

00:20:16.115 --> 00:20:18.083 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing
it under the radar.

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.318 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:21.287 align:middle line:84%
So we need to start keeping
an eye on those guys.

00:20:21.287 --> 00:20:25.157 align:middle line:84%
And I had read about those
chemtrail-resistant seed stocks.

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:27.726 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I mean, that's a whole
other subject to get into,

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:28.961 align:middle line:90%
but on the subject of --

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:30.629 align:middle line:84%
let's go back for a
moment to Bill Gates.

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:33.432 align:middle line:84%
I mean, very, kind of
interesting player in all

00:20:33.432 --> 00:20:36.835 align:middle line:84%
of this because as I recall
he was also one of those

00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:39.838 align:middle line:84%
that was deeply involved
with that seed bank project

00:20:39.838 --> 00:20:43.108 align:middle line:84%
up in the Arctic which
is the collection

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:46.812 align:middle line:84%
and preservation
of heritage seeds.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:50.616 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm. So you look at that.

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:52.584 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
great lengths --

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:54.219 align:middle line:84%
when I say "they" I
mean whoever they are.

00:20:54.219 --> 00:20:55.554 align:middle line:90%
But he's one of "they."

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:57.389 align:middle line:90%
>>That's well [mixed speakers].

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:59.291 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's right.

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:01.593 align:middle line:84%
They're going to great
lengths to make sure

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.128 align:middle line:90%
that there is a preservation

00:21:03.128 --> 00:21:06.332 align:middle line:84%
of these natural seed
stocks for someone.

00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean most likely
for themselves.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.501 align:middle line:90%
For them. Yet at -- while

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:14.973 align:middle line:84%
at the same time investing even
more heavily in the annihilation

00:21:14.973 --> 00:21:17.843 align:middle line:84%
of natural crops in their
natural heirloom state

00:21:17.843 --> 00:21:19.945 align:middle line:90%
for the public at large.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:23.916 align:middle line:84%
It's just like how the Monsanto
cafeteria serves its executives

00:21:23.916 --> 00:21:25.250 align:middle line:90%
organic food [laughter].

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.984 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee you...

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:26.852 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:27.353 align:middle line:90%
...that...

00:21:27.353 --> 00:21:28.354 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:21:28.354 --> 00:21:28.988 align:middle line:84%
...that Bill Gates
does not eat GMOs.

00:21:28.988 --> 00:21:30.089 align:middle line:90%
No. I guess not.

00:21:30.089 --> 00:21:34.159 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you that
Oprah does not eat GMOs.

00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:36.195 align:middle line:84%
They just met a couple
of days ago.

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:37.029 align:middle line:90%
No one's talked about this...

00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I haven't heard about that.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.699 align:middle line:84%
They just met the -- some
of the world's wealthiest --

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:45.037 align:middle line:84%
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Bill
Gates, Oprah, Warren Buffett,

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:46.705 align:middle line:84%
were some of the
names that I recall.

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:49.908 align:middle line:84%
They met on an island
off of South Carolina;

00:21:49.908 --> 00:21:54.113 align:middle line:84%
a small gated island that
no one was allowed to go

00:21:54.113 --> 00:21:56.348 align:middle line:84%
to near their hotel,
this massive hotel.

00:21:56.348 --> 00:21:58.484 align:middle line:84%
They're meeting for
a two-day conference

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:00.252 align:middle line:90%
that Bill Gates initiated.

00:22:00.252 --> 00:22:02.121 align:middle line:90%
I called it a "mini Bilderberg."

00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:04.289 align:middle line:84%
I was just going to say it's
a "mini Bilderberg," exactly.

00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:05.858 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. And that's what
I'm saying it is.

00:22:05.858 --> 00:22:07.993 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying that they're
meeting for something.

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:09.395 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what it is,

00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:13.665 align:middle line:84%
but I know that there's major
movements right now against GMOs

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:17.169 align:middle line:84%
and Monsanto, and Bill Gates
being a major stockholder

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:19.371 align:middle line:84%
in the biotech industry
at large.

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:22.074 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they could be meeting
on any number of topics.

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.308 align:middle line:90%
The Bill Gates -- Bill

00:22:23.308 --> 00:22:25.878 align:middle line:84%
and Melinda Gates Foundation
is heavily supportive

00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:84%
of not only GMOs but going
over and vaccinating just

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.815 align:middle line:90%
about everybody in the world.

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:31.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.384 align:middle line:84%
The polio vaccine, of course,
being the number one cause

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.752 align:middle line:90%
of polio throughout the world.

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:35.954 align:middle line:84%
>>Hmm-mm. But I mean, who knows
what they're talking about.

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:38.457 align:middle line:84%
I can only theorize but some
of the world's wealthiest

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:39.858 align:middle line:84%
and most powerful
are meeting there.

00:22:39.858 --> 00:22:43.962 align:middle line:84%
They had 20 private expensive
jets lined up in a row

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:45.664 align:middle line:84%
at the airport there,
and they went

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:47.199 align:middle line:84%
over to this private
gated island.

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:49.735 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Bilderberg, we can at
least go -- which is, of course,

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:84%
the world's wealthiest
and most powerful...

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.738 align:middle line:84%
At least you can find out
who the attendees are.

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:53.972 align:middle line:90%
You can find out the attendees.

00:22:53.972 --> 00:22:55.274 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm, Hmm-mm.

00:22:55.274 --> 00:22:56.442 align:middle line:84%
Asia Times  called it, I
believe, "the masterminds

00:22:56.442 --> 00:22:57.843 align:middle line:84%
of the world" or
something like that,

00:22:57.843 --> 00:22:59.445 align:middle line:90%
so it's open, it's open news.

00:22:59.445 --> 00:23:01.947 align:middle line:84%
Right. And you can go and
protest it and, you know,

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:03.082 align:middle line:90%
look at who's going in.

00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:04.817 align:middle line:84%
But when they take it to
a whole other level --

00:23:04.817 --> 00:23:08.187 align:middle line:84%
they're flying to a private
island that's completely gated.

00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:10.155 align:middle line:84%
No one's allowed in
when they're over there.

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:11.356 align:middle line:90%
It's a golf resort.

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.791 align:middle line:84%
Only a thousand people
are even there right now.

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.593 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. They're taking
it to whole other level.

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:16.495 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing over there?

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:18.664 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe we won't find out.

00:23:18.664 --> 00:23:20.065 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully someone
like you will sniff

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.600 align:middle line:84%
around long enough
and we get an idea.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.869 align:middle line:84%
And please let us know
when you figure it out.

00:23:23.869 --> 00:23:25.838 align:middle line:84%
Okay, so. Let's get
into the subject

00:23:25.838 --> 00:23:28.974 align:middle line:84%
of genetically modified humans
because this whole subject

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:32.244 align:middle line:84%
of transhumanism I find
fascinating and I went ahead

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:35.914 align:middle line:84%
and started looking into some of
the sites like intelligence.org

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:38.717 align:middle line:84%
and kind of frightening
when you look

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:41.520 align:middle line:84%
at this double-speak
kind of agenda.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.891 align:middle line:84%
And so that leads us to the
subject of singularity, okay?

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So explain to us the
notion of singularity

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:52.664 align:middle line:84%
in this particular use, and
what the larger agenda is

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:53.999 align:middle line:90%
for the human species.

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:58.203 align:middle line:84%
So, there's two variations
of what is going on here.

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:01.406 align:middle line:84%
The first is what the
public relations team at all

00:24:01.406 --> 00:24:03.475 align:middle line:84%
of these transhumanism
organizations would

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:04.543 align:middle line:90%
like you to think.

00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:06.645 align:middle line:84%
And the second is
reality, of course.

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:08.647 align:middle line:90%
The first is that transhumanism

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:11.183 align:middle line:84%
and singularity is this
amazing new thing where we get

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:14.253 align:middle line:84%
to create a genetically
modified machine --

00:24:14.253 --> 00:24:15.854 align:middle line:90%
android bodies, if you will --

00:24:15.854 --> 00:24:17.456 align:middle line:84%
and we merge our
consciousness with them.

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.691 align:middle line:84%
And we're all happy and
we live forever together

00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:22.327 align:middle line:84%
in complete utopia where
everyone gets the same amount

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:25.597 align:middle line:84%
of resources and it's
basically a socialist dream

00:24:25.597 --> 00:24:27.099 align:middle line:90%
where we all live forever.

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:28.734 align:middle line:84%
But the reality behind
transhumanism --

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:31.470 align:middle line:84%
and you can see this
at the 2045.com website

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:35.340 align:middle line:84%
which is a wealthy Russian
scientist who says --

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.010 align:middle line:84%
it was in the  Washington
Post  I believe it was --

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.445 align:middle line:90%
the title was "Wealthiest Elite

00:24:40.445 --> 00:24:43.815 align:middle line:84%
of the World Can Live
Forever for a Price."

00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:46.118 align:middle line:84%
So if they donate X amount
of millions of dollars

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:48.153 align:middle line:84%
to this initiative, and
this is on its face.

00:24:48.153 --> 00:24:48.987 align:middle line:90%
I mean it's already being done.

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:49.988 align:middle line:90%
And what is the initiative for?

00:24:49.988 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:90%
Sure. So the initiative --

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.861 align:middle line:84%
by 2015 they're going to
create artificial bodies.

00:24:55.861 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:84%
All the way up to
2045 the scale goes.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.869 align:middle line:84%
It starts at 2015 and I believe
it's 2025, 2030, 2040, 2045.

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:07.906 align:middle line:84%
So at 2045 they expect to have
complete artificial brains,

00:25:07.906 --> 00:25:11.977 align:middle line:84%
artificial bodies, and a
holographic-like creation,

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:13.779 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that
you are supposed

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:17.082 align:middle line:84%
to transport your
consciousness into.

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:20.385 align:middle line:84%
So the wealthy elite like
Bill Gates in an interview --

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:23.155 align:middle line:84%
they said, "What do you
want to do before you die?"

00:25:23.155 --> 00:25:26.024 align:middle line:84%
He said, "I'm not going
to die," matter of factly.

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:27.459 align:middle line:90%
He said, "I'm not going to die."

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.328 align:middle line:84%
They don't think
they're going to die.

00:25:29.328 --> 00:25:31.964 align:middle line:84%
They think that they
deserve to live forever,

00:25:31.964 --> 00:25:34.032 align:middle line:84%
and that their massive
wealth will do that.

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.367 align:middle line:90%
So they have been investing --

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.569 align:middle line:84%
I think there's 23,000
members of the group.

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:40.639 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean all of them
pay for it, but 23,000 members

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:44.876 align:middle line:84%
of 2045, and there's a huge
conference coming up about 2045.

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.878 align:middle line:84%
That they think they're
going to live forever

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:48.814 align:middle line:90%
through genetic modification.

00:25:48.814 --> 00:25:50.048 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
talking about.

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:51.917 align:middle line:84%
This is light years
ahead of Monsanto.

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:54.453 align:middle line:84%
This is light years
ahead of GMO crops.

00:25:54.453 --> 00:25:55.854 align:middle line:84%
This is talking --
and we're talking

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
about genetically
modified bodies

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.092 align:middle line:90%
that aren't even flesh anymore.

00:26:00.092 --> 00:26:02.828 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
holographic-like presentation.

00:26:02.828 --> 00:26:04.496 align:middle line:90%
But here's the kicker.

00:26:04.496 --> 00:26:07.499 align:middle line:84%
Guess how these bodies are
controlled -- through RFID.

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:12.037 align:middle line:84%
Yes. They have an
RFID-like interface implanted

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:14.873 align:middle line:84%
into the artificial brains,
controlled, of course,

00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.608 align:middle line:90%
by some type of super-computer.

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:18.276 align:middle line:84%
And these people
are down with that.

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:20.145 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah. People
like Bill Gates.

00:26:20.145 --> 00:26:21.546 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. They think
it's the future,

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:22.914 align:middle line:90%
and that's what they want,

00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:24.916 align:middle line:84%
because there's two
things to that.

00:26:24.916 --> 00:26:27.653 align:middle line:84%
First of all, whoever controls
the super-computer controls

00:26:27.653 --> 00:26:29.888 align:middle line:90%
every single artificial body.

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:32.858 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, if you're in
control of the super-computer,

00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:34.926 align:middle line:84%
they think they can
live forever.

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:37.929 align:middle line:84%
Of course we know also to
transport one's consciousness

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:40.532 align:middle line:84%
onto a genetically
modified artificial brain

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:44.269 align:middle line:84%
with an RFID chip does not
sound like living to me.

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.505 align:middle line:84%
But even when I wrote the
article explaining this,

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:49.808 align:middle line:84%
most of the comments were, "I
can't wait to live forever,"

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:52.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, "I would want
one of these bodies."

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.679 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, man, then I
can finally be free

00:26:53.679 --> 00:26:55.414 align:middle line:84%
of disease," and
stuff like that.

00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:57.749 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion -- not
even in my opinion --

00:26:57.749 --> 00:27:00.085 align:middle line:90%
in reality, it's a con.

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:02.854 align:middle line:84%
They're going to push it
as, "You can live forever."

00:27:02.854 --> 00:27:05.691 align:middle line:84%
And the super-humans -- they're
pushing it as super-humans.

00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:07.793 align:middle line:84%
But in reality its
total enslavement

00:27:07.793 --> 00:27:09.361 align:middle line:90%
and I'm warning against this.

00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:11.663 align:middle line:84%
We have to understand
the grand scheme of this.

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.231 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the Monsanto GMOs.

00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.499 align:middle line:90%
Today it is.

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:17.102 align:middle line:84%
But tomorrow it will be
pushing the anti in the media.

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:18.236 align:middle line:90%
We're already seeing it.

00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:19.604 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
people to breed

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:20.939 align:middle line:90%
with Neanderthal DNA [laughter]

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:26.144 align:middle line:84%
and [multiple speakers] genetic
manipulation is the topic

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.512 align:middle line:90%
in hand for the wealthy elite.

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:28.880 align:middle line:90%
I know. It is.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.716 align:middle line:84%
And you know the interesting
thing is there is a component

00:27:30.716 --> 00:27:32.284 align:middle line:90%
completely missing from it.

00:27:32.284 --> 00:27:34.986 align:middle line:84%
The missing component is the
whole notion of the spirit,

00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:37.522 align:middle line:84%
or the soul, or the
thing that imbues life

00:27:37.522 --> 00:27:39.291 align:middle line:90%
into the physical body.

00:27:39.291 --> 00:27:41.660 align:middle line:84%
And, you know -- and
we can get into a long

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.029 align:middle line:84%
and deep philosophical
discussion about it,

00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:45.864 align:middle line:84%
but clearly the individuals
involved

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:48.800 align:middle line:84%
with this have a very great
fear of physical death

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.302 align:middle line:90%
because they must believe

00:27:50.302 --> 00:27:52.504 align:middle line:84%
that there is nothing
beyond the physical body.

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:53.739 align:middle line:90%
Well, get this.

00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:56.174 align:middle line:84%
I mean the mainstream media
acts as if you're crazy

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:58.076 align:middle line:84%
if you believe there's
any form of afterlife

00:27:58.076 --> 00:27:59.644 align:middle line:90%
or you have any form of soul.

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:01.279 align:middle line:84%
Right. You know, don't
dare talk about that.

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.014 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. You don't talk
about soul in the newspaper.

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:04.282 align:middle line:90%
You don't talk about God.

00:28:04.282 --> 00:28:06.318 align:middle line:84%
Well now, in the Saturday
religious pages sometimes,

00:28:06.318 --> 00:28:07.652 align:middle line:90%
in the editorials.

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:09.654 align:middle line:84%
But then they report it matter
of factly that we're going

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:11.523 align:middle line:90%
to transport our consciousness

00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:12.891 align:middle line:84%
into these other
people's bodies.

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:15.293 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, what do they think that
consciousness is [laughter]?

00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:16.528 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they don't think.

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.496 align:middle line:90%
They don't think.

00:28:17.496 --> 00:28:18.363 align:middle line:84%
They're just drones,
mindless drones.

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:19.064 align:middle line:90%
Did you ever see...

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:20.198 align:middle line:90%
They are. ...the videos

00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:22.200 align:middle line:84%
of the mainstream media
reading the same script

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.603 align:middle line:84%
across multiple stations,
all around the world?

00:28:24.603 --> 00:28:26.705 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. It's on Conan
O'Brian sometimes,

00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and I know there's other
radio hosts that play it, too.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.542 align:middle line:84%
They read the same script
over and over again.

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:31.243 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. It's...

00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:32.210 align:middle line:90%
Same buzz words.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.778 align:middle line:84%
It's... ...strictly
theater media.

00:28:32.778 --> 00:28:33.612 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is.

00:28:33.612 --> 00:28:34.913 align:middle line:90%
And anything they don't agree

00:28:34.913 --> 00:28:36.848 align:middle line:84%
with they call it conspiracy
theory until they say it.

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Just like it's a
conspiracy theory

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.585 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness exists,
whether you have a soul,

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:43.121 align:middle line:84%
or that there's morality
in life or absolute facts.

00:28:43.121 --> 00:28:44.890 align:middle line:84%
Well then they go ahead and
say, "We're going to transport

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.025 align:middle line:84%
that consciousness,"
that doesn't exist,

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:48.527 align:middle line:90%
"into your new artificial body."

00:28:48.527 --> 00:28:50.462 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. Right.

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:52.931 align:middle line:84%
And so -- I mean the interesting
thing is they're saying this.

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:56.968 align:middle line:84%
So they must accept at least
there's an intelligent aspect

00:28:56.968 --> 00:29:00.772 align:middle line:84%
of the being that can be
transported as you say.

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:03.475 align:middle line:84%
But anything beyond that, an
understanding of something

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:08.380 align:middle line:84%
that is essentially infinite by
nature, they can't go that far

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.514 align:middle line:90%
or there wouldn't be this fear.

00:29:09.514 --> 00:29:10.982 align:middle line:90%
I mean, really.

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:13.752 align:middle line:84%
You're still very young
but would you choose

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:16.888 align:middle line:84%
to use this same body
and vehicle forever?

00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:17.889 align:middle line:90%
I mean, wouldn't you want

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:19.591 align:middle line:84%
to have a little
different experience

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:21.059 align:middle line:90%
at some time or another?

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:22.894 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you get it
down to some, you know,

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:24.896 align:middle line:84%
kind of fundamental
views of it as --

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:29.034 align:middle line:84%
if this whole thing is a
journey, if it's a game of sorts

00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:32.704 align:middle line:84%
for learning, for experiencing
and so forth, wouldn't you want

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to have it kind of a textured
history instead of living

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.878 align:middle line:84%
in this one RFID-controlled
-- to control body forever?

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:40.745 align:middle line:90%
That's not living.

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:41.680 align:middle line:90%
That's not living.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.314 align:middle line:90%
That's a...

00:29:42.314 --> 00:29:42.981 align:middle line:90%
It's a complete...

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:43.548 align:middle line:90%
...drone existence.

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:44.316 align:middle line:90%
It's slavery.

00:29:44.316 --> 00:29:45.183 align:middle line:90%
It's slavery.

00:29:45.183 --> 00:29:46.585 align:middle line:84%
It's mental and physical
slavery.

00:29:46.585 --> 00:29:49.321 align:middle line:84%
I don't even believe it's
going to be you in that body.

00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:50.989 align:middle line:90%
No. It might seem like you...

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:51.790 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm. ...you know.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.391 align:middle line:90%
It might look like you.

00:29:53.391 --> 00:29:55.994 align:middle line:84%
It might even, when
someone's talking to it,

00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:90%
may even react similarly to you,

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.398 align:middle line:84%
because it's programmed
to do so perhaps.

00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:03.468 align:middle line:84%
But you cannot take your
consciousness and put it

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.136 align:middle line:84%
in a genetically
modified brain...

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:07.472 align:middle line:90%
No. ...and then live forever.

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:90%
No. It's a scam.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:09.674 align:middle line:84%
It's a complete scam,
and they're going

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:10.742 align:middle line:90%
to lose their humanity to this.

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:11.810 align:middle line:90%
They will.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.478 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
go in droves and beg

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.946 align:middle line:90%
for their artificial bodies.

00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:18.216 align:middle line:84%
They're going to beg at the time
their overlords essentially,

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:20.118 align:middle line:84%
they will say, "Please let
me have an artificial body.

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:21.786 align:middle line:90%
I'll pay you X amount of money."

00:30:21.786 --> 00:30:23.555 align:middle line:84%
Or people who are
terminally ill, especially,

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.557 align:middle line:84%
will be highly susceptible
to this

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:26.658 align:middle line:84%
because they're clinging
to life.

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:29.261 align:middle line:90%
Yes. If they were to admit

00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.163 align:middle line:84%
that you do have a real
spiritual consciousness,

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:35.166 align:middle line:84%
there is an afterlife,
that what you do matters,

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:36.902 align:middle line:84%
people wouldn't cling
to this concept.

00:30:36.902 --> 00:30:38.003 align:middle line:84%
Well, and if you
go even further,

00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:39.671 align:middle line:84%
if you go into Eastern
philosophy,

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:42.774 align:middle line:84%
not only is there an afterlife
which is an in-between life,

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:46.077 align:middle line:84%
but then you have a chance to do
the same thing again, and again,

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:49.447 align:middle line:84%
and again, and the wheel of
-- every incarnation as --

00:30:49.447 --> 00:30:51.283 align:middle line:84%
would be viewed in
the East, for example.

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:53.985 align:middle line:84%
It's a very organic way
to look at it, as well.

00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Sure. Why -- you know,
I don't subscribe

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.655 align:middle line:90%
to that, but the point is...

00:30:56.655 --> 00:30:59.591 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...that whatever you
think it gives higher purpose

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:00.659 align:middle line:90%
to what you're doing.

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:03.461 align:middle line:84%
Right. And what they
want is to eradicate

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:06.131 align:middle line:84%
that completely unless
it fits their agenda.

00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:09.534 align:middle line:84%
Right. So what we talk
about here is we have

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:12.637 align:middle line:84%
to defeat Monsanto and the
GMOs, because what we're talking

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.973 align:middle line:84%
about now, it seems
crazy to people,

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:15.974 align:middle line:90%
but it's just around the corner.

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:16.808 align:middle line:90%
It's already happening.

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.944 align:middle line:90%
They're already experimenting

00:31:18.944 --> 00:31:21.279 align:middle line:84%
with genetically-modified
humans, taking animals

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:22.747 align:middle line:90%
and insects and merging them.

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. And it's only a
matter of time now as well --

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.520 align:middle line:84%
it's already happening -- until
they start screening children

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.422 align:middle line:84%
for genetic traits
and say, "Oh, well.

00:31:30.422 --> 00:31:31.556 align:middle line:90%
He has a biogenetic trait.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.425 align:middle line:84%
We can fix that for you
if you want," or "Hey,

00:31:33.425 --> 00:31:34.826 align:middle line:90%
you want a designer child?"

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.428 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:31:36.428 --> 00:31:38.263 align:middle line:90%
Well look at 23andme.

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:39.364 align:middle line:90%
Look at Bill Gates.

00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Why the -- not Bill
Gates, the Google wives.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.168 align:middle line:90%
The wives of the two

00:31:43.168 --> 00:31:47.305 align:middle line:84%
of the primary Google founders
were immediately funded

00:31:47.305 --> 00:31:49.441 align:middle line:84%
when they came into contact
with their new husbands --

00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:51.810 align:middle line:84%
were funded for genetic,
their genetic project,

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.179 align:middle line:84%
which is the friendly little
thing called 23and me.

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Just give us a little
bit of you blood.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.948 align:middle line:84%
You have to pay for
it by the way.

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:59.617 align:middle line:84%
And -- or -- I don't know
if it's even just blood

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:00.952 align:middle line:90%
or if it has saliva and hair.

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:01.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.455 align:middle line:90%
I've never gone through it.

00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:06.391 align:middle line:84%
And we'll let you know
what your markers are --

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:08.460 align:middle line:84%
predispositions towards
certain diseases,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.861 align:middle line:90%
so you can protect yourself.

00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:12.097 align:middle line:84%
Kind of like Angelina
Jolie did in taking that...

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:13.164 align:middle line:90%
I was just going to say that.

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:14.532 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:14.532 --> 00:32:17.002 align:middle line:84%
Angelina just -- and now -- it
was just announced yesterday

00:32:17.002 --> 00:32:19.804 align:middle line:84%
for anybody watching,
that Angela Jolie had both

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:22.974 align:middle line:84%
of her breasts removed
as a preventative measure

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:25.443 align:middle line:84%
because of these
kinds of markers

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:84%
that have been identified
in these interesting kind

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.183 align:middle line:84%
of genetic panels that
people are doing voluntarily,

00:32:32.183 --> 00:32:33.551 align:middle line:90%
and paying to have done.

00:32:33.551 --> 00:32:35.854 align:middle line:84%
Right at the top, you think
Google doesn't have all

00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:36.988 align:middle line:90%
of that information?

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:39.290 align:middle line:90%
Their wives established it.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.258 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the thing.

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:41.726 align:middle line:90%
Worshiping genetics...

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:43.928 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...is above
everything else.

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:46.564 align:middle line:84%
Even though we know that
research has shown time

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:49.067 align:middle line:84%
and time again -- I just wrote
about the Angelina Jolie thing.

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:52.070 align:middle line:84%
See her remove both her
breasts, as did Sharon Osborne,

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.072 align:middle line:90%
and a Miss America contestant.

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It's the worship of genetics...

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.510 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...that goes
into saying, "Well,

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.378 align:middle line:84%
you cannot do anything
about your fate.

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:01.713 align:middle line:90%
Your fate is sealed.

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:04.182 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you have a mutation
of your certain gene?

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:06.084 align:middle line:90%
You need to cut off a limb."

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:08.486 align:middle line:84%
Doctors are saying -- some
doctors, not all doctors --

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:10.355 align:middle line:84%
most doctors aren't,
but some are --

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:13.691 align:middle line:84%
saying that if you have a
predisposition genetically

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:16.594 align:middle line:84%
to something, to a cancer,
a form of cancer or disease,

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:18.630 align:middle line:84%
you need to now remove
that limb.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.433 align:middle line:84%
So what if you have a
predisposition to brain cancer?

00:33:21.433 --> 00:33:23.701 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the mainstream media has a
predisposition to brain cancer.

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:25.737 align:middle line:84%
There are people who
supposedly have functioned fine

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:28.206 align:middle line:84%
without a brain which tells you
something about where mind is.

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:29.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah [laughter], exactly.

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.477 align:middle line:84%
But the point is when we
look at it in that way

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:35.513 align:middle line:84%
that genes are the ohm -- you
know, the -- Gods basically.

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:37.248 align:middle line:84%
Genes cannot be changed
and they --

00:33:37.248 --> 00:33:40.018 align:middle line:84%
they're supposedly
influencing our fate.

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:41.853 align:middle line:90%
But the reality is -- we know

00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:44.556 align:middle line:84%
from research even
antioxidants play a role

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:46.991 align:middle line:84%
in how the genes are influenced
and how they're expressed.

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.126 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.327 align:middle line:84%
And the  Biology of
Belief  by Bruce Lipton

00:33:49.327 --> 00:33:51.863 align:middle line:84%
that our own beliefs, and
behaviors, and actions,

00:33:51.863 --> 00:33:54.466 align:middle line:84%
and expectations alter
our genetic disposition.

00:33:54.466 --> 00:33:57.936 align:middle line:84%
There's a Norwegian
institute and they found

00:33:57.936 --> 00:34:02.273 align:middle line:84%
that not only can inflammation
be changed, the way you eat,

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:04.275 align:middle line:84%
at -- you know, for example,
versus if you sit down

00:34:04.275 --> 00:34:06.511 align:middle line:84%
and eat a bag of potato
chips or if you have juice --

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:08.947 align:middle line:84%
like I just had watermelon
juice before I came here.

00:34:08.947 --> 00:34:11.583 align:middle line:84%
The inflammation genes
will express differently.

00:34:11.583 --> 00:34:14.152 align:middle line:84%
And inflammation is known to be
at the root of pretty much...

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:14.853 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:34:14.853 --> 00:34:16.186 align:middle line:90%
...all chronic disease.

00:34:16.186 --> 00:34:18.456 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
if you're going to eat

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:20.825 align:middle line:84%
like crap you're going to feel
like crap, you're going to look

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:23.695 align:middle line:84%
like crap, and ultimately
it's going to manifest itself

00:34:23.695 --> 00:34:25.096 align:middle line:90%
in a life-threatening disease.

00:34:25.096 --> 00:34:27.331 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. But instead,
they want to say,

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:28.633 align:middle line:90%
"That has nothing to do with it.

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:30.068 align:middle line:90%
It's all your genes."

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:32.103 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately it
will come down to,

00:34:32.103 --> 00:34:34.005 align:middle line:84%
instead of just chopping
things off --

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:36.273 align:middle line:84%
well, we don't want to have
to have a poor baby that has

00:34:36.273 --> 00:34:38.510 align:middle line:84%
to chop off her breasts
when she gets older,

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.979 align:middle line:84%
so we need to go ahead
and alter that genetically

00:34:40.979 --> 00:34:43.414 align:middle line:84%
at the root level before
you even have the child.

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:47.519 align:middle line:84%
Or, you know, we have a
genetic predisposition

00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:50.121 align:middle line:90%
to even worse disease, you know.

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:53.525 align:middle line:84%
They could have autism when
they're born, you know.

00:34:53.525 --> 00:34:54.992 align:middle line:84%
Let's not talk about the
environmental factors

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:56.194 align:middle line:90%
or anything.

00:34:56.194 --> 00:34:56.995 align:middle line:84%
Right. But they could have
autism so you're going

00:34:56.995 --> 00:34:57.929 align:middle line:90%
to have to abort that child.

00:34:57.929 --> 00:34:59.731 align:middle line:84%
Or, in fact, they
did it already.

00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:01.432 align:middle line:90%
It was a real thing decades ago.

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:02.667 align:middle line:90%
It's called eugenics.

00:35:02.667 --> 00:35:04.536 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. Now I'm not talking
about modern eugenics.

00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:07.472 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about decades ago
they literally would sterilize

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:08.339 align:middle line:90%
you in the United States.

00:35:08.339 --> 00:35:09.073 align:middle line:90%
Look it up.

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:10.141 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they did.

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:11.643 align:middle line:84%
There were states
that had to pay money

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:13.945 align:middle line:84%
to the families that
had it happen.

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:16.147 align:middle line:90%
They were extremely racist --

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:19.484 align:middle line:84%
blacks and minorities and
everyone that was found

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:84%
to be genetically inferior were
not allowed to have children.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.122 align:middle line:84%
Right. We can see a
resurfacing of that.

00:35:24.122 --> 00:35:27.659 align:middle line:84%
And it won't be racist
and it won't be prejudice.

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:31.362 align:middle line:84%
It will be based in
science and science is,

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:32.630 align:middle line:90%
you know, not prejudiced.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.765 align:middle line:90%
It's just the hard numbers.

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:36.267 align:middle line:84%
And you have a genetic
manipulation

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:39.637 align:middle line:84%
and you have a genetic mutation
that needs to be cancelled out,

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:43.575 align:middle line:84%
or else you might repopulate and
cause in such a genetic mutation

00:35:43.575 --> 00:35:46.644 align:middle line:84%
to others when countless people
have the genetic mutation

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:47.879 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:51.783 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have hemochromatosis
genetic manipulation

00:35:51.783 --> 00:35:53.885 align:middle line:90%
and I was originally tested

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.186 align:middle line:84%
around the same time
for the Lyme disease.

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.921 align:middle line:90%
I had extreme iron levels.

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:59.157 align:middle line:84%
They told me the only way I
could possibly do anything

00:35:59.157 --> 00:36:01.492 align:middle line:84%
about it, since it was
at the genetic level --

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:04.095 align:middle line:84%
and genes do play a role,
but we can influence them.

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:06.030 align:middle line:84%
Since it was at the
genetic level I had

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.832 align:middle line:84%
to give blood about
once a week...

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:08.533 align:middle line:90%
My goodness.

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:09.367 align:middle line:90%
...or twice a month...

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:10.501 align:middle line:90%
Or how about leeches?

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:11.869 align:middle line:90%
You know, why not [laughter]?

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:15.073 align:middle line:84%
And they told me I had to give
blood at least once a month

00:36:15.073 --> 00:36:17.508 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of my life or my
iron levels would be so high

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:19.344 align:middle line:90%
that I would eventually die.

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:21.446 align:middle line:90%
And I did give blood at first.

00:36:21.446 --> 00:36:22.814 align:middle line:90%
It went down a little bit.

00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:25.583 align:middle line:84%
But then I realized -- and
again did my own research.

00:36:25.583 --> 00:36:28.353 align:middle line:84%
Started taking turmeric,
a product I now create

00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:31.022 align:middle line:84%
under Natural Attitude with
Dr. Group, and doing a bunch

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.724 align:middle line:84%
of other things --
liver cleanses.

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:34.325 align:middle line:90%
And my iron levels are fine now.

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:35.827 align:middle line:84%
Right. All of my
levels are fine.

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:37.929 align:middle line:84%
And you won't be reading
about that, however.

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:38.763 align:middle line:90%
No. You won't...

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:39.897 align:middle line:90%
No. ...be reading about that...

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:41.032 align:middle line:84%
No. ...and they would
say that that's fake.

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.267 align:middle line:90%
How is it fake?

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:43.501 align:middle line:84%
It's a real life example
and I've talked to thousands

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:45.003 align:middle line:84%
of people who have
cured themselves

00:36:45.003 --> 00:36:45.937 align:middle line:90%
from anything -- from...

00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:47.238 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely ...cancer
to anything.

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.806 align:middle line:84%
Breast cancer is one of the
easiest cancers to treat.

00:36:48.806 --> 00:36:50.408 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:53.511 align:middle line:84%
James Forsythe, who
was an oncologist --

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is an oncologist in Reno
is doing amazing things

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.348 align:middle line:90%
with people.

00:36:57.348 --> 00:37:00.952 align:middle line:84%
Kind of blending Western
medicine and minor forms with,

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:03.221 align:middle line:84%
as you say, consciousness
about what you're putting

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.056 align:middle line:84%
in the body, lifestyle,
etcetera.

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.592 align:middle line:84%
And so he's kind of in the
middle between mainstream

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:14.098 align:middle line:84%
and totally a hundred percent
natural, and yet he's getting --

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:19.137 align:middle line:84%
I think he's right now at about
a 75% cure rate three years

00:37:19.137 --> 00:37:22.473 align:middle line:84%
into Stage 4 Cancer
-- three years in.

00:37:22.473 --> 00:37:28.079 align:middle line:84%
And they expect it to be well
over 50%, as opposed to 2 to 3%

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.747 align:middle line:90%
in the oncology industry.

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.082 align:middle line:84%
That's what people
don't understand.

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:32.583 align:middle line:90%
Look at the stats.

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:35.620 align:middle line:84%
To have a five-year life
expectancy with Stage 4 Cancer

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.623 align:middle line:84%
with traditional chemo
radiation is 2 to 3%.

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And these guys -- even in
his zone there which --

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:47.565 align:middle line:84%
you know, he's doing a great
job -- is already over 50%.

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:48.499 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we're finding...

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:49.267 align:middle line:84%
You know? ...major
changes where...

00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:50.335 align:middle line:90%
And... ...people just...

00:37:50.335 --> 00:37:51.469 align:middle line:84%
Yep. ...drinking a
glass of juice a day.

00:37:51.469 --> 00:37:53.204 align:middle line:84%
That's right, and we're
going to talk about --

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.806 align:middle line:84%
in the second hour we're
going to talk about a lot

00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:57.175 align:middle line:84%
of these ways in which
we can basically detox

00:37:57.175 --> 00:37:58.776 align:middle line:90%
and prevent this in ourselves.

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.178 align:middle line:84%
But, really, what
you're talking about --

00:38:00.178 --> 00:38:04.482 align:middle line:84%
this whole debate has to do with
a polarization that has occurred

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:06.718 align:middle line:84%
within our psyches and
within our societies

00:38:06.718 --> 00:38:09.887 align:middle line:84%
between technology
and nature, really.

00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:10.588 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:11.989 align:middle line:90%
That's what's occurred.

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:16.527 align:middle line:84%
And so we -- my hope in people
understanding this subject is

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:19.731 align:middle line:84%
that we need to,
they claim, to --

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:21.366 align:middle line:84%
well, probably one
side or the other.

00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:24.068 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be just taken
down the chute of technology

00:38:24.068 --> 00:38:26.637 align:middle line:84%
if we're not aware and don't
make decisions on behalf

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.840 align:middle line:90%
of our natural birthrights.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.708 align:middle line:84%
Now can you imagine
if Angelina Jolie --

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:33.444 align:middle line:84%
and I wrote about this -- came
out instead and said, "Hey,

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:36.781 align:middle line:84%
what about the parabins and
the BPA and all the plastic"...

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:37.949 align:middle line:84%
How much good she
could have done.

00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:39.751 align:middle line:84%
...and the household
cleaners that we know

00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:41.052 align:middle line:90%
through numerous studies --

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.755 align:middle line:84%
over 130 studies link
BPA to breast cancer.

00:38:43.755 --> 00:38:46.057 align:middle line:84%
What if she said, "Hey,
we need to get rid

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:48.259 align:middle line:90%
of these environmental factors.

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.794 align:middle line:84%
We need to get rid
of the triggers

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:53.965 align:middle line:84%
that are causing breast cancer
instead of cut off our breasts."

00:38:53.965 --> 00:38:55.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a defeatist
attitude that --

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.803 align:middle line:84%
it reminds me of the
eNations attitude right now.

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:01.406 align:middle line:84%
Instead of actually
taking charge of your life

00:39:01.406 --> 00:39:04.075 align:middle line:84%
and doing things, there's
always a quick fix.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:07.412 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. Whether it's, you know,
a diet pill that ultimately ends

00:39:07.412 --> 00:39:11.082 align:middle line:84%
up giving you a heart attack, or
going to your doctor and saying,

00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:12.583 align:middle line:90%
"You know, I can't lose weight.

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.585 align:middle line:84%
I need surgery to
cut the fat out."

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:18.322 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. Cutting off your breasts
is the same defeatist attitude

00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:20.525 align:middle line:90%
that, "I can't do anything.

00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:22.060 align:middle line:90%
I can't empower myself."

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.763 align:middle line:84%
And the reason -- she says
she's empowering women.

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:29.801 align:middle line:84%
Right. Let me tell you, she'
empowering women to be defeatist

00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:32.737 align:middle line:84%
and go against everything
that is empowerment.

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:34.205 align:middle line:84%
You know, as a woman
yourself, you understand.

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.774 align:middle line:84%
And I've spoken -- you
know, most of the readers

00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:38.109 align:middle line:90%
on our site are women.

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:39.911 align:middle line:84%
They understand that
women's rights

00:39:39.911 --> 00:39:41.779 align:middle line:84%
and women's empowerment
has nothing to do

00:39:41.779 --> 00:39:44.048 align:middle line:84%
with chopping off your
breasts and subscribing

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.583 align:middle line:84%
to the mainstream
medical paradigm.

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:46.284 align:middle line:90%
Oh my gosh, no.

00:39:46.284 --> 00:39:46.984 align:middle line:90%
It has everything...

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:47.785 align:middle line:90%
It's a bastardization...

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.053 align:middle line:90%
...to do with taking charge.

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.488 align:middle line:84%
Well -- and there's something
even larger than that.

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:53.891 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the larger
prevailing energies at large,

00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:57.829 align:middle line:84%
we're entering the period --
and I'm talking cosmically --

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:01.365 align:middle line:84%
where the re-exertion of the
feminine influence is critical

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:03.000 align:middle line:84%
to have a balanced
and healthy society.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.769 align:middle line:90%
We've gone way out of balance.

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:07.772 align:middle line:84%
We've been in a masculine
paradigm, you know,

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:11.209 align:middle line:84%
for quite a long time now
-- thousands of years.

00:40:11.209 --> 00:40:12.577 align:middle line:90%
We have controlling forces

00:40:12.577 --> 00:40:14.679 align:middle line:84%
that are generally
masculine of nature.

00:40:14.679 --> 00:40:17.815 align:middle line:84%
The one thing that has been
stripped down and subdued

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:21.319 align:middle line:84%
and we bought into it because,
ultimately, you can see why.

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:22.954 align:middle line:84%
I mean, obviously when you
have thousands of years

00:40:22.954 --> 00:40:24.689 align:middle line:84%
in reinforcement --
women have bought into it

00:40:24.689 --> 00:40:27.525 align:middle line:84%
to not seek their own
authority any longer.

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:31.128 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of the worst
trends that has happened

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:33.064 align:middle line:84%
to the female, is
the destruction

00:40:33.064 --> 00:40:36.000 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche interest
in nature and self.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.638 align:middle line:84%
And to me -- as this is just
about to be re-established

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:46.010 align:middle line:84%
on a purely energetic cosmic
level, it's no surprise.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:51.449 align:middle line:84%
First of all, these forces we're
talking about are very conscious

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:54.452 align:middle line:84%
of larger cycles
including cosmic cycles,

00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:57.588 align:middle line:84%
cosmological influences,
energetic influences,

00:40:57.588 --> 00:41:00.324 align:middle line:84%
paradigm shifts -- they're
fully aware of all of this.

00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:01.792 align:middle line:84%
And so when you see
the reemergence

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:03.394 align:middle line:90%
of the feminine intelligence,

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.229 align:middle line:84%
what is the first thing
you're going to do,

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:06.597 align:middle line:84%
except try to destroy
it even further?

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.498 align:middle line:90%
Co-opt it.

00:41:07.498 --> 00:41:08.165 align:middle line:90%
Co-opt it?

00:41:08.165 --> 00:41:08.699 align:middle line:90%
Take the...

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:09.834 align:middle line:90%
Destroy it.

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.836 align:middle line:84%
Take the energy of the
movement and focus it

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.137 align:middle line:90%
where they want it to go.

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.306 align:middle line:90%
Exactly. Empowering women

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:18.943 align:middle line:84%
and women's rights is no longer
what it should be in reality.

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:21.712 align:middle line:84%
It's taking that massive
energy of women who are saying,

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:24.315 align:middle line:84%
you know, "I want to do
something about this,"

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:26.784 align:middle line:84%
and forwarding it
into ridiculous things

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:28.619 align:middle line:84%
that are detrimental
to women at large.

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Using our cultural leaders
such as Angelina Jolie...

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.025 align:middle line:90%
What a horrible cultural leader.

00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:36.794 align:middle line:84%
...which -- very, very --
and very, very sadly many,

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:38.129 align:middle line:90%
many women are probably going

00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:40.131 align:middle line:84%
to follow suit just
as result of that...

00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:41.966 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes. ...one press release.

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.801 align:middle line:90%
That press release was one

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:45.903 align:middle line:84%
of the most damaging
I've heard of in years.

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:49.006 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it was connected
to a major company that...

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:50.141 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:51.142 align:middle line:84%
...whose stock went up
when she announced it...

00:41:51.142 --> 00:41:52.543 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:53.844 align:middle line:84%
...who owned the patents to the
very gene she's talking about...

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.046 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:56.547 align:middle line:84%
...because a large
percentage of your genetic code

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:59.317 align:middle line:84%
and my genetic code is
owned by major corporations.

00:41:59.317 --> 00:42:00.718 align:middle line:90%
And that gets into this, too.

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:03.254 align:middle line:84%
They're going to create
humans with our genetic codes

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:04.755 align:middle line:90%
and they're going to own them.

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:05.456 align:middle line:90%
And they're creating them...

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:06.557 align:middle line:90%
Yes. ...as they own.

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:08.659 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be for
profit human production.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:09.860 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.862 align:middle line:90%
And she said that she's hoping

00:42:11.862 --> 00:42:14.932 align:middle line:84%
to inspire people
along this line.

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:16.801 align:middle line:84%
She's hoping to provide
that inspiration

00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:17.935 align:middle line:90%
for all of these women.

00:42:17.935 --> 00:42:19.737 align:middle line:84%
Yet no celebrity's come
out and talk about --

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:21.239 align:middle line:84%
well, no, major in
the new celebrities.

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:23.341 align:middle line:84%
There are some, but no major
celebrity's come out and say,

00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:25.042 align:middle line:90%
"Hey, we need to get rid of BPA.

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.277 align:middle line:90%
We need to..."

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:28.412 align:middle line:84%
Right. ..."start going
until alternative therapies.

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:90%
We need to stop GMOs."

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.449 align:middle line:84%
There's some that came out --
Danny DeVito and others made

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:33.217 align:middle line:84%
that great video
about stopping GMOs.

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.686 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. But I mean something
really big needs to happen

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.488 align:middle line:84%
and it is March Against
Monsanto and stuff.

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I think Monsanto's going down.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.625 align:middle line:84%
But no one's talking
about the future of it

00:42:40.625 --> 00:42:41.926 align:middle line:90%
which we're discussing today.

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:43.995 align:middle line:84%
Right. And if we don't
understand the main concept

00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:46.497 align:middle line:84%
of it all, where it's
headed, then we're just going

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:47.798 align:middle line:90%
to be playing "Whackable."

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:50.801 align:middle line:84%
Right. We're just going to
have a huge hammer that has

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:51.769 align:middle line:90%
"activism" written on it --

00:42:51.769 --> 00:42:53.004 align:middle line:84%
someone should draw
this comic --

00:42:53.004 --> 00:42:54.705 align:middle line:84%
and the little moles
come up, you know.

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:56.907 align:middle line:90%
It says Monsanto GMOs.

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.309 align:middle line:90%
And then a bit Italy, you know.

00:42:58.309 --> 00:43:01.712 align:middle line:84%
Everything will come up: GMO
pineapple, GMO apple, GMO pear.

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.180 align:middle line:84%
Just whack, whack,
whack, whack...

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.417 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...until the whole thing
blows up and transfeminism comes

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.985 align:middle line:84%
out and the hammer
doesn't do anything to it

00:43:07.985 --> 00:43:09.887 align:middle line:84%
because it's a metal
robot, you know.

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:12.189 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
ultimate future of it.

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:17.628 align:middle line:84%
We can sit here and pinprick
hitting the symptoms of GMOs...

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...and genetic
modification,

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.899 align:middle line:84%
but unless we address the
root cause and understand

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:26.037 align:middle line:84%
that it's ultimately coming to
genetic manipulation worldwide,

00:43:26.037 --> 00:43:28.773 align:middle line:84%
transhumanism -- which is pushed
as something that's great...

00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:30.608 align:middle line:84%
Which is where we have
to make our choice.

00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:33.878 align:middle line:84%
Is that the path we choose to go
down or send our children down?

00:43:33.878 --> 00:43:36.781 align:middle line:84%
Or are we going to choose the
other path and stay with nature?

00:43:36.781 --> 00:43:38.749 align:middle line:84%
And here's why it's
so alarming though.

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:41.118 align:middle line:84%
It's just like the
mainstream medical paradigm.

00:43:41.118 --> 00:43:44.155 align:middle line:84%
Its like, do we want to actually
choose to think for ourselves,

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:45.122 align:middle line:90%
do our own research...

00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:46.090 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah. ...empower ourselves?

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.224 align:middle line:90%
Break the mass hypnosis.

00:43:47.224 --> 00:43:48.359 align:middle line:90%
But some people don't.

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:50.227 align:middle line:84%
Some people would rather
just slide along life

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and get their eternal bodies and
then, you know, succumb to that.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:54.031 align:middle line:84%
But you know, you
hear about that.

00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:84%
You hear about the
polarization, right?

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.669 align:middle line:84%
You hear about it on every
level; polarization in education

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.838 align:middle line:90%
and money, everything.

00:44:00.838 --> 00:44:03.407 align:middle line:84%
This, I think, is what
the polarization is.

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:04.575 align:middle line:90%
It is consciousness.

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:06.911 align:middle line:84%
I mean it all comes
back to consciousness.

00:44:06.911 --> 00:44:10.881 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to choose to be
proactive in how we intend

00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:12.950 align:middle line:90%
to care for, not just the planet

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:15.419 align:middle line:84%
and not just our
bodies, but each other?

00:44:15.419 --> 00:44:16.487 align:middle line:90%
All of it.

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.155 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to stay
with nature and know

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:20.491 align:middle line:84%
that nature is expressing
itself perfectly

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.860 align:middle line:84%
without our intervention
and interference?

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.929 align:middle line:84%
Or are going to choose
to take the easy way

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:27.665 align:middle line:84%
out which is let the
media tell us what to do,

00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:30.267 align:middle line:84%
let these corporations decide
for us what we're going to eat

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:32.336 align:middle line:84%
and what we may -- be
made available to us.

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.938 align:middle line:90%
It's just a consciousness thing.

00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:36.073 align:middle line:84%
We can either engage
or not engage.

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:38.109 align:middle line:84%
If we don't engage,
there's the polarization.

00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:39.643 align:middle line:90%
We go the road of technology.

00:44:39.643 --> 00:44:40.711 align:middle line:90%
And that's not everybody.

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.947 align:middle line:84%
It's those who chose
not to engage.

00:44:42.947 --> 00:44:44.081 align:middle line:90%
Right, exactly.

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:45.716 align:middle line:84%
And they say knowledge
is power, but knowledge

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:47.451 align:middle line:90%
without action is worthless.

00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes. And the reason for that is
-- just to give you an example.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.156 align:middle line:84%
I get emails from these
major corporations

00:44:52.156 --> 00:44:54.859 align:middle line:84%
that are selling products that
are detrimental to your health.

00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:56.560 align:middle line:84%
They offer me massive
amounts of cash --

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:58.529 align:middle line:90%
more than I make in years --

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.564 align:middle line:84%
to sell and hawk their
garbage products.

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:03.667 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. And if I were to
say yes, which I don't.

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:06.937 align:middle line:84%
But, if I were to say yes, you
know, the flesh side of me says,

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:07.938 align:middle line:90%
"Wow, that's so much money.

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:08.973 align:middle line:90%
That could help."

00:45:08.973 --> 00:45:10.541 align:middle line:90%
You can justify anything.

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.309 align:middle line:84%
That would help to empower
the website, you know.

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:14.378 align:middle line:84%
We get -- we could get
so much more traffic.

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:15.780 align:middle line:90%
We could hire more writers.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.581 align:middle line:84%
We could get more marketing and
wouldn't that be, you know...

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:18.816 align:middle line:90%
That's rationalization.

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:19.517 align:middle line:90%
But, right?

00:45:19.517 --> 00:45:20.317 align:middle line:90%
No that's [inaudible].

00:45:20.317 --> 00:45:21.552 align:middle line:90%
No, it happens all the time.

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:22.686 align:middle line:90%
This is what happens.

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:24.355 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. You say, "Well, I
could hire more writers.

00:45:24.355 --> 00:45:25.556 align:middle line:90%
I could get more information.

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.491 align:middle line:84%
I ultimately help more
people even though that --

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:29.493 align:middle line:84%
you know, this product
could harm people."

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.661 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:33.397 align:middle line:84%
That would ruin my
reputation once people found

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:35.232 align:middle line:90%
out the garbage in the products.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.001 align:middle line:90%
It would be hurting people.

00:45:37.001 --> 00:45:39.436 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing good that
can come from hurting people.

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:41.806 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately the site
would fail I promise you.

00:45:41.806 --> 00:45:44.041 align:middle line:84%
And any site that
does that will fail.

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.911 align:middle line:84%
Any site that succumbs and
says, "I want the money

00:45:46.911 --> 00:45:48.212 align:middle line:90%
over that," will fail.

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.114 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is
happening with GMOs

00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:51.682 align:middle line:90%
and the transhumanism movement.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:54.919 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that succumbs to the
greed of immortality and,

00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:56.687 align:middle line:84%
you know, massive wealth
-- one person said,

00:45:56.687 --> 00:46:00.991 align:middle line:84%
"If I had an artificial immortal
body, I could make so much money

00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:01.792 align:middle line:90%
because I get those people...

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:04.028 align:middle line:90%
I know. ...working forever.

00:46:04.028 --> 00:46:05.429 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:46:05.429 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately succumbing to that
greed when you know the right

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.536 align:middle line:84%
and the moral side
is the opposite

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:15.005 align:middle line:84%
of what you're choosing
will ultimately fall on you

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.473 align:middle line:90%
and cave in on yourself.

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:19.977 align:middle line:84%
The definition of sin is
caving in on oneself in Latin.

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:22.646 align:middle line:84%
Yes. All very good
points and the reality --

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:26.483 align:middle line:84%
you said, for you, the reality
is Monsanto will likely cease

00:46:26.483 --> 00:46:27.852 align:middle line:90%
to exist.

00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:30.321 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about this
one path that everybody is more

00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:33.224 align:middle line:84%
or less had -- blinders
have been installed as much

00:46:33.224 --> 00:46:35.493 align:middle line:84%
as they possibly can to
keep people looking just

00:46:35.493 --> 00:46:36.560 align:middle line:90%
down the one path.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.828 align:middle line:90%
All right, we know that.

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:40.698 align:middle line:84%
But, as you say, there's
activity that's happening

00:46:40.698 --> 00:46:41.899 align:middle line:90%
on the other side.

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:45.102 align:middle line:84%
People are waking up, and
I would say in droves.

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:47.538 align:middle line:84%
I learn a lot from --
I commute every week,

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.006 align:middle line:84%
so I'm on an airplane
twice a week,

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:50.174 align:middle line:90%
and in airports, and just...

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:53.043 align:middle line:84%
Wow. ...kind of out in
public a lot that way.

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:55.346 align:middle line:84%
So I sit next to people of
all different backgrounds

00:46:55.346 --> 00:46:59.316 align:middle line:84%
and I'm shocked at how many
people are at least beginning

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.952 align:middle line:84%
to say, "I don't
know about that."

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:03.554 align:middle line:90%
To me, that is the beginning

00:47:03.554 --> 00:47:07.157 align:middle line:84%
of what is essentially a
taking back our consciousness

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:08.359 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:47:08.359 --> 00:47:10.928 align:middle line:84%
It's just that first doubt
and almost everybody,

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:15.065 align:middle line:84%
if not fully aware, are
starting to ask questions now.

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:16.634 align:middle line:90%
So I mean that's hopeful.

00:47:16.634 --> 00:47:18.369 align:middle line:90%
So, getting back to action.

00:47:18.369 --> 00:47:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Vermont.

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.105 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:24.108 align:middle line:84%
So Vermont House just
passed a bill to label GMOs.

00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:25.409 align:middle line:90%
And that's an excellent victory.

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:27.678 align:middle line:84%
It's going to go
to the Senate now.

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:29.280 align:middle line:84%
Everyone needs to call
their senators even

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.314 align:middle line:90%
if you're not in Vermont.

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:30.881 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Just blast ...

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:31.649 align:middle line:90%
Say yeah, go.

00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:32.149 align:middle line:90%
...them with phone calls.

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.484 align:middle line:90%
Go for it.

00:47:33.484 --> 00:47:35.052 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. So I do think we're
definitely seeing victories.

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:36.921 align:middle line:90%
And the March Against Monsanto,

00:47:36.921 --> 00:47:39.590 align:middle line:84%
which is an open source
grassroots movement to go ahead

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:41.525 align:middle line:84%
and protest everywhere
against Monsanto.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:42.893 align:middle line:90%
Here in Austin...

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:44.695 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...there's actually
going to be about 10,000 people

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:47.031 align:middle line:84%
out at the Capital with
bullhorns and everything.

00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:48.065 align:middle line:90%
There'll be speakers.

00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:49.733 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is a very
active community.

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.201 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. I like Austin.

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.269 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. I like the spirit here.

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:54.705 align:middle line:84%
People are alive and
awake and engaged.

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:55.973 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they are.

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.308 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. We're seeing it more
and more everywhere, too.

00:47:57.308 --> 00:47:58.876 align:middle line:90%
I mean I do a lot of travelling.

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:00.344 align:middle line:90%
I've travelled the country.

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:04.048 align:middle line:84%
In fact to, you know,
visit multiple areas.

00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:06.917 align:middle line:84%
But every single place I went,
there was massive support

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:07.918 align:middle line:90%
for what was going on.

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. Just complete
massive support.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.754 align:middle line:90%
So I think, ultimately,

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:13.090 align:middle line:84%
people are understanding
what's going on.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.458 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Okay. So let's talk about now
some of the physical effects

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.096 align:middle line:84%
of it because we have to
engage with these GMOs

00:48:19.096 --> 00:48:21.598 align:middle line:84%
on a different level as well,
and that's the physical level.

00:48:21.598 --> 00:48:23.033 align:middle line:84%
Now, I mean, we probably
should have talked

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:23.968 align:middle line:90%
about it in the beginning.

00:48:23.968 --> 00:48:26.036 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
the big agenda.

00:48:26.036 --> 00:48:27.938 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
physically what's happening

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:30.207 align:middle line:84%
because you cannot
make a good decision

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:32.076 align:middle line:84%
if your mind is not
working clearly.

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:35.779 align:middle line:84%
Sure. Let's talk about
how GMOs would --

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:39.583 align:middle line:84%
through the chain of events --
physiologically affect our --

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:43.687 align:middle line:84%
not only our attention spans,
our energy levels, and it --

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:44.755 align:middle line:90%
but even our intelligence.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:45.756 align:middle line:90%
How's this going?

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:46.657 align:middle line:84%
Sure. Well, I'm actually
glad we talked

00:48:46.657 --> 00:48:47.825 align:middle line:90%
about the big picture first...

00:48:47.825 --> 00:48:49.059 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...because if there's
anything people need

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:49.960 align:middle line:90%
to understand, it's that.

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.761 align:middle line:90%
Yes... And some people...

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:51.595 align:middle line:90%
...indeed.

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:52.529 align:middle line:90%
...might have said like, "Oh,

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:53.097 align:middle line:84%
I already know the
effects of GMOs.

00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:54.231 align:middle line:90%
I don't care."

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:56.133 align:middle line:84%
But it's important that
they understand also...

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:57.534 align:middle line:90%
Where it's leading.

00:48:57.534 --> 00:48:58.636 align:middle line:84%
...how to effectively -- yeah,
where it's leading, but also how

00:48:58.636 --> 00:49:01.038 align:middle line:84%
to effectively talk
to somebody abut GMOs.

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:03.674 align:middle line:84%
Because what we know
GMOs are doing --

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:05.509 align:middle line:84%
based on peer review
research that we can use

00:49:05.509 --> 00:49:08.145 align:middle line:84%
against them because, you know,
so many people say, "Well,

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:10.481 align:middle line:84%
it's unscientific
to be against GMOs."

00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:12.883 align:middle line:84%
Well, like I mentioned
earlier, you can go on Pubnet --

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:14.084 align:middle line:90%
and here's the kicker.

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:15.986 align:middle line:90%
28 -- I believe there's 34 now.

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:18.656 align:middle line:84%
It was 28 some months ago
when I read the article

00:49:18.656 --> 00:49:20.457 align:middle line:90%
but I believe it's 34 now.

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:22.459 align:middle line:84%
Peer reviewed pieces
of research available

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.028 align:middle line:84%
on the National Library
of Medicine...

00:49:24.028 --> 00:49:26.764 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...show that Roundup --
you know, Roundup Ready Crops

00:49:26.764 --> 00:49:28.265 align:middle line:84%
that are producing
Roundup in your gut

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:31.802 align:middle line:84%
when you consume them -- Roundup
has been linked to lymphoma,

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.704 align:middle line:84%
DNA damage, cancer,
and the list goes on.

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:34.738 align:middle line:90%
You can scroll down.

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:35.739 align:middle line:84%
You can keep -- I
did it in the video.

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:37.508 align:middle line:84%
I scrolled down for
like 30 seconds.

00:49:37.508 --> 00:49:40.144 align:middle line:84%
That's how many different
associated diseases there are

00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:41.879 align:middle line:90%
with Roundup and GMOs.

00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:44.148 align:middle line:84%
The only lifelong study
-- what did it find?

00:49:44.148 --> 00:49:45.349 align:middle line:90%
Massive tumors to the point

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.950 align:middle line:84%
where the rats couldn't
even move anymore.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.385 align:middle line:90%
The only lifelong study.

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:52.723 align:middle line:84%
And Monsanto had a 30-day study
that was funded, of course,

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:56.226 align:middle line:84%
by Monsanto, and we look at the
only studies that are funded

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:59.630 align:middle line:84%
by Monsanto versus the studies
aren't funded by Monsanto

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.465 align:middle line:84%
and we see a world
of difference.

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:03.434 align:middle line:84%
The two Roundup studies
that are funded

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:05.936 align:middle line:84%
by Monsanto basically
say, "Everything's perfect

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:07.204 align:middle line:90%
and everything's dreamy."

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:09.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the studies that
are independent say, "Hey,

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.141 align:middle line:90%
wait a minute, you know.

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:13.510 align:middle line:84%
This is completely wrong what
the other studies are saying.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.813 align:middle line:84%
This is causing serious
damage, to the point

00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:17.881 align:middle line:90%
where it's giving rats cancer."

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:20.217 align:middle line:84%
And even, you know, in
many cases, they're looking

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.652 align:middle line:90%
at what it could do to humans

00:50:21.652 --> 00:50:23.053 align:middle line:84%
and the applications
and saying...

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:25.689 align:middle line:84%
Right. ..."This has no
place in the food supply."

00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:28.759 align:middle line:84%
There's one leading scientist
who said that, "If any scientist

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:31.495 align:middle line:84%
in the world tells you
that GMOs are safe,

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:33.163 align:middle line:90%
they're either lying or stupid."

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.098 align:middle line:90%
And that's the fact.

00:50:34.098 --> 00:50:34.898 align:middle line:90%
Or they're being paid to say it.

00:50:34.898 --> 00:50:35.732 align:middle line:90%
Of course.

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:36.834 align:middle line:90%
They have -- whine, of course.

00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:37.835 align:middle line:90%
Of course, yeah, exactly.

00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:41.105 align:middle line:84%
And we deal with
these paid off trolls

00:50:41.105 --> 00:50:42.473 align:middle line:84%
and the comments
every single day.

00:50:42.473 --> 00:50:46.977 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that's what I wanted to get
into a bit is disinformation

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:49.546 align:middle line:84%
on sites and how
it's distributed.

00:50:49.546 --> 00:50:52.216 align:middle line:84%
It's a very complex and
interesting subject.

00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:53.317 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, exactly.

00:50:53.317 --> 00:50:55.152 align:middle line:84%
So, we get hundreds
of emails and comments

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:57.988 align:middle line:84%
and everything each day
from Facebook, messages,

00:50:57.988 --> 00:50:59.456 align:middle line:90%
and comments on Facebook.

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:00.524 align:middle line:90%
It's a job.

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.292 align:middle line:84%
And I handle it all
pretty much myself.

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:03.327 align:middle line:90%
So it's a job.

00:51:03.327 --> 00:51:04.128 align:middle line:90%
Oh, wow. And...

00:51:04.128 --> 00:51:05.596 align:middle line:90%
I applaud you for that.

00:51:05.596 --> 00:51:08.565 align:middle line:84%
...we try to respond to all
the good emails that we get,

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:11.001 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of times
like, for example,

00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:13.137 align:middle line:84%
one of the most interesting
emails I ever received --

00:51:13.137 --> 00:51:15.239 align:middle line:84%
I actually went on a
few shows about this.

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:18.108 align:middle line:84%
A biotech scientist -- and I
confirmed it with Mike Adams.

00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:19.676 align:middle line:84%
It was indeed a biotech
scientist.

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:20.944 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm. I can't give the name...

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:22.946 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...because the
lawyers say they will sue us,

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:26.183 align:middle line:84%
and we cannot, you know,
pay off the costs for that.

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:28.785 align:middle line:84%
But they guy says
that it's awesome

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.521 align:middle line:84%
that GMOs are causing
infertility

00:51:30.521 --> 00:51:33.423 align:middle line:84%
and killing people because, he
says, the population is too big.

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:36.426 align:middle line:84%
This is a guy -- this is
a senior scientist at one

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:38.128 align:middle line:90%
of the biotech companies.

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:40.731 align:middle line:84%
And he's working on not
only GMOs but other things

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:43.433 align:middle line:84%
in the biotech field, and
he's saying that it's amazing.

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Awesome. He says it's
awesome -- in all upper case.

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:49.940 align:middle line:84%
That GMOs are killing people
because there's too many people

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.076 align:middle line:84%
in the world and they use up
too much -- too many resources.

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:54.945 align:middle line:84%
And he says that
he justifies it.

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:57.181 align:middle line:84%
Like I was saying earlier,
anyone can justify anything.

00:51:57.181 --> 00:52:00.851 align:middle line:84%
He says, "It's good because if
there weren't GMO crops killing

00:52:00.851 --> 00:52:04.421 align:middle line:84%
people then everyone would have
used up their resources by now."

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:05.489 align:middle line:90%
So they justify it.

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:06.523 align:middle line:90%
That pretty much says it all.

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:07.524 align:middle line:90%
Sociopathic.

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.526 align:middle line:90%
They're sociopathic.

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:14.097 align:middle line:84%
This is against life itself
these -- and is I think --

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:16.366 align:middle line:84%
you've even used the
word traitors to life...

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.134 align:middle line:90%
Traitors to humanity.

00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:17.901 align:middle line:90%
...and humanity.

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:18.535 align:middle line:90%
That's why he emailed me.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:19.770 align:middle line:90%
I called him...

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:21.638 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...a biotech scientist
-- traitors to humanity.

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:24.775 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. And it just goes to
show though, there's no debate.

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:25.909 align:middle line:90%
They know what it's doing.

00:52:25.909 --> 00:52:26.877 align:middle line:90%
There's no debate.

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.779 align:middle line:90%
They justify it to themselves.

00:52:28.779 --> 00:52:30.981 align:middle line:84%
I think that was --
that's a really beautifully

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.349 align:middle line:90%
said statement.

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.151 align:middle line:84%
That that man -- I mean, even
though you can't identify --

00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.352 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter who he is.

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:37.454 align:middle line:84%
The fact that anyone in
that field would have said

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:39.122 align:middle line:90%
that should drive it home.

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:41.692 align:middle line:84%
And also, when you're talking
about the debate itself,

00:52:41.692 --> 00:52:44.895 align:middle line:84%
the other study that you
brought up, the legitimate study

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.263 align:middle line:90%
by the 900 scientists --

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:48.899 align:middle line:84%
and that's a really good
beginning place for people to go

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:50.868 align:middle line:84%
with this subject if
they're trying to talk

00:52:50.868 --> 00:52:52.703 align:middle line:84%
with other individuals
about it --

00:52:52.703 --> 00:52:54.271 align:middle line:90%
that the reality is it was built

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.706 align:middle line:84%
for that one thing:
to feed the planet.

00:52:55.706 --> 00:52:57.641 align:middle line:90%
I mean it was designed --

00:52:57.641 --> 00:53:00.244 align:middle line:84%
it was ostensibly designed
to feed the planet.

00:53:00.244 --> 00:53:02.045 align:middle line:84%
That's the one thing
it's not doing.

00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:03.714 align:middle line:84%
And now they're creating
GM humans and...

00:53:03.714 --> 00:53:05.515 align:middle line:84%
Yes. ...looking at the
trait to help humanity.

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:07.150 align:middle line:84%
Yes. You have to
understand it's a pattern.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:09.019 align:middle line:84%
Yes. Like the mole, we
have to stop it now.

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:09.620 align:middle line:90%
They're lying.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:10.787 align:middle line:90%
They don't care.

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:12.356 align:middle line:84%
No. They don't care
about you or your health.

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:15.259 align:middle line:84%
Right. And it needs to stop
today or we're really going

00:53:15.259 --> 00:53:16.627 align:middle line:84%
to regret it in the
next few years.

00:53:16.627 --> 00:53:19.263 align:middle line:84%
Well, meanwhile, the only power
the consumer has is whether

00:53:19.263 --> 00:53:21.398 align:middle line:84%
or not to buy genetically
modified food.

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:22.699 align:middle line:84%
So... And to march
on capitals and...

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And to march on capital.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.568 align:middle line:90%
...to spread the word...

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:25.369 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...and get awareness
out and we're doing

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:26.470 align:middle line:90%
that in massive [inaudible].

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.739 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the labeling laws, okay?

00:53:28.739 --> 00:53:31.008 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we just talked
about Vermont a moment ago.

00:53:31.008 --> 00:53:34.945 align:middle line:84%
Whole Foods says they will
voluntarily label GMOs.

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:37.714 align:middle line:90%
In 2018. In 2018.

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:39.449 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
that for a moment.

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:41.251 align:middle line:84%
Why the big delay
in your opinion?

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:44.721 align:middle line:84%
Well, they claim that it's,
you know, manufacturing issues

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:48.825 align:middle line:84%
and having manufactured products
myself -- with Dr. Group and,

00:53:48.825 --> 00:53:52.162 align:middle line:84%
you know, creating our -- our
turmeric and everything else --

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:54.765 align:middle line:84%
it's really not as
challenging as they say.

00:53:54.765 --> 00:53:56.400 align:middle line:90%
I mean, labels are dirt-cheap.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.369 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. I mean, it's
a couple cents a label

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.971 align:middle line:84%
for a really good
label when you order...

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:02.406 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take five
years to switch over.

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:03.840 align:middle line:90%
It does not take five years.

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.009 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
source materials as if it's

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:08.679 align:middle line:84%
such a challenge to, you know,
change their source materials.

00:54:08.679 --> 00:54:10.947 align:middle line:84%
I understand there's
larger manufacturers.

00:54:10.947 --> 00:54:12.649 align:middle line:90%
Who cares if it's a challenge?

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:14.051 align:middle line:90%
I made an article --

00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:16.687 align:middle line:84%
talked about how even Now Foods
has GMOs in their supplements.

00:54:16.687 --> 00:54:21.591 align:middle line:84%
They fund anti-GMO
groups, yet they have GMOs

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:23.694 align:middle line:84%
in their products, and
they say, "Oh, it's so hard

00:54:23.694 --> 00:54:25.195 align:middle line:90%
to find sources that aren't GMO.

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:26.196 align:middle line:90%
It's so expensive."

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.332 align:middle line:84%
Then make more expensive
products.

00:54:28.332 --> 00:54:31.468 align:middle line:84%
You can't go ahead and
justify everything you do.

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:34.237 align:middle line:84%
There's too much justification
for all this wrongdoing.

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:37.207 align:middle line:84%
And these major supplement
companies who claim to be

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:40.577 align:middle line:84%
on our side need to be
exposed over and over again

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:43.113 align:middle line:84%
like Now Foods and others,
and in their email response

00:54:43.113 --> 00:54:46.983 align:middle line:84%
to me they said, "Yeah, we
use GMOs but we try not to."

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.052 align:middle line:84%
They try not to isn't good
enough if they're using them.

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:50.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not good enough.

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.621 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be a
hundred percent GMO.

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:54.691 align:middle line:84%
The products that I help
create or put on the site --

00:54:54.691 --> 00:54:57.160 align:middle line:84%
they have to be a hundred
percent GMO-free and one

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.329 align:middle line:84%
of the best ways to do that
is to get kosher testing

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:01.365 align:middle line:84%
and everything like that and
look at all that information.

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. And they have
to contain a fluoride --

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.771 align:middle line:84%
the water has to be purified to
remove all forms of fluoride,

00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:09.239 align:middle line:90%
all forms of contaminants.

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:13.076 align:middle line:84%
For example, you go out and you
get some soup from Whole Foods

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:16.446 align:middle line:84%
and it's organic, and it
says, "Filtered water."

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:18.415 align:middle line:90%
Filtered water means nothing.

00:55:18.415 --> 00:55:21.818 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do some tests
and reveal it in a video,

00:55:21.818 --> 00:55:24.688 align:middle line:84%
but some of the most famous
organic brands are filled

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.656 align:middle line:84%
with fluoride, more so
than the tap water...

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:27.591 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. ...in major cities.

00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:28.859 align:middle line:84%
I talked to Mike
Adams about that.

00:55:28.859 --> 00:55:30.293 align:middle line:90%
Yes. Because guess what they do?

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:33.063 align:middle line:84%
They used filtered water and the
FDA is a completely worthless

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:35.232 align:middle line:84%
organization so filtered
means nothing.

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:38.034 align:middle line:84%
Filtered could mean that you
go in and you take the salt

00:55:38.034 --> 00:55:39.236 align:middle line:90%
out of it and nothing else.

00:55:39.236 --> 00:55:40.904 align:middle line:84%
Filtered could mean
that you go in

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:42.572 align:middle line:84%
and you take the
good minerals out

00:55:42.572 --> 00:55:45.642 align:middle line:84%
and you leave the fluoride in,
and there's no real testing

00:55:45.642 --> 00:55:48.211 align:middle line:84%
for the massive amounts because
they say fluoride is safe.

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Or even the metals that
are in the supplements.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.648 align:middle line:84%
There's no real testing
for that.

00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:53.817 align:middle line:84%
So we have to go above and
beyond and spend the money,

00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:55.385 align:middle line:84%
and we do it and we
don't boast about it

00:55:55.385 --> 00:55:57.320 align:middle line:90%
that much because guess what?

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.688 align:middle line:90%
You know it's worth it.

00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:00.624 align:middle line:84%
The reason we talk about it
is to encourage others to seek

00:56:00.624 --> 00:56:03.126 align:middle line:84%
for it and to do it in
their own manufacturing.

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:06.096 align:middle line:84%
But, for example, we're
doing a new product.

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:08.298 align:middle line:90%
We just had a metals test on all

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:12.436 align:middle line:84%
of the entire ingredients
for the product.

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:15.539 align:middle line:84%
It's expensive, and we had to
go ahead import only the ones

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:18.241 align:middle line:84%
that are completely
free of all metals.

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:19.443 align:middle line:90%
But guess what?

00:56:19.443 --> 00:56:21.678 align:middle line:84%
It's worth it in the end
because sooner or later --

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:23.814 align:middle line:84%
in a few years, or
now, or whatever --

00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:25.148 align:middle line:90%
they're going to realize

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:27.717 align:middle line:84%
if their products are garbage
all it takes is one scan.

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.419 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. It takes
one test to find ...

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:31.688 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...it's full of
cadmium and aluminum.

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:32.956 align:middle line:90%
And then guess what?

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:34.491 align:middle line:84%
That product is no longer
going to be on the market

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:36.159 align:middle line:84%
because people are
going to expose it.

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:37.494 align:middle line:84%
And this is a value
thing, as well.

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:39.362 align:middle line:84%
I mean, people have been
accustomed to being able

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:42.799 align:middle line:84%
to go to, you know, the big box
stores and buy cheap everything.

00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:46.970 align:middle line:84%
And supposedly even cheap
quality vitamins, and minerals,

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.605 align:middle line:90%
and other kinds of supplements.

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:53.443 align:middle line:84%
So this is really -- we have
to embrace a new set of values

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:55.679 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to how we're
going to feed our bodies

00:56:55.679 --> 00:56:57.113 align:middle line:90%
and our supplementation.

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:58.648 align:middle line:90%
Because it's really --

00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.584 align:middle line:90%
the technology is there now

00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:04.054 align:middle line:84%
to essentially reveal
what is in all this stuff.

00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:06.957 align:middle line:84%
So when the public at
large can go about this --

00:57:06.957 --> 00:57:11.328 align:middle line:84%
and I know that that is under
way in revealing the toxicity

00:57:11.328 --> 00:57:12.362 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of what are considered

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.564 align:middle line:84%
to be very healthy
nutrients out there.

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:17.534 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited to see
what that list looks like.

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:20.303 align:middle line:84%
So in the interim what we have
to do is take responsibility

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:24.107 align:middle line:84%
as individuals to have the
cleanest possible stuff we can

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:25.041 align:middle line:90%
put in our bodies.

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.476 align:middle line:90%
And it does cost more.

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:28.745 align:middle line:84%
It does, it does, to
a pretty large extent.

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:31.982 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. There's a cool new app
that you can use to identify

00:57:31.982 --> 00:57:34.384 align:middle line:84%
if your products are
owned by parent companies

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:36.987 align:middle line:90%
like Coca Cola and Pepsi...

00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:38.255 align:middle line:90%
Oh, what's the app?

00:57:38.255 --> 00:57:39.356 align:middle line:84%
It's -- I believe it's --
you can look it up online.

00:57:39.356 --> 00:57:41.825 align:middle line:84%
Okay. Just look it
up online, you know,

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.527 align:middle line:84%
app for parent companies,
Coca Cola...

00:57:43.527 --> 00:57:44.594 align:middle line:90%
Okay. ...or whatever.

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.229 align:middle line:84%
But it just got released
like two days ago

00:57:46.229 --> 00:57:47.497 align:middle line:84%
so I'm not sure of
the name exactly.

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:48.298 align:middle line:90%
We're covering it right now.

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:49.132 align:middle line:90%
Okay, we'll find it.

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.267 align:middle line:90%
But there's a cool app for that,

00:57:50.267 --> 00:57:52.502 align:middle line:84%
and then also you can go
ahead and look online.

00:57:52.502 --> 00:57:54.571 align:middle line:84%
There's so many charts that
show the parent companies

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:55.839 align:middle line:90%
that own these things.

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:57.874 align:middle line:84%
If you buy from your local
farmers market that's all

00:57:57.874 --> 00:58:00.143 align:middle line:84%
organic, though, obviously
you're not supporting Coca Cola

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:01.545 align:middle line:90%
[multiple speakers].

00:58:01.545 --> 00:58:03.113 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that's what I was just
going to say is we can do that.

00:58:03.113 --> 00:58:06.082 align:middle line:84%
And now, you know, sometimes
organic farmers are --

00:58:06.082 --> 00:58:08.785 align:middle line:84%
they have to use city
water supplies to be able

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:10.854 align:middle line:84%
to water their land
which has some fluoride

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:12.556 align:middle line:84%
and some other constituents
in it.

00:58:12.556 --> 00:58:16.059 align:middle line:84%
And so we're getting down
to levels of consciousness.

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.994 align:middle line:84%
You have to start
where you can start.

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:21.531 align:middle line:84%
Going through local farmers
market, that matters.

00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. We can definitely
talk about that during

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.035 align:middle line:84%
like the detox segment
or anything like that.

00:58:25.035 --> 00:58:26.436 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm, yeah.

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:29.039 align:middle line:84%
There's so many simple things
you could do to eliminate 95%...

00:58:29.039 --> 00:58:31.041 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...of all the
environmental toxins

00:58:31.041 --> 00:58:33.643 align:middle line:84%
and food-based toxins that
you're getting on a daily basis.

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:34.711 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel so much better.

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.313 align:middle line:90%
Yes. You can't eliminate 100%.

00:58:36.313 --> 00:58:37.981 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that says they're
a hundred percent clean

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.115 align:middle line:90%
and everything is lying.

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.784 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. It's almost impossible.

00:58:40.784 --> 00:58:43.486 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just from the air we
breathe in Chemtrails alone.

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:47.057 align:middle line:84%
We only have a few minutes
left so give us an idea

00:58:47.057 --> 00:58:51.561 align:middle line:84%
of what else we can do as
best as possible besides going

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:54.631 align:middle line:84%
to organic farmers at our
local farmers markets.

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:56.199 align:middle line:84%
What are some other
things we can do?

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.635 align:middle line:84%
Well, baseline, you want
to buy everything that is

00:58:58.635 --> 00:58:59.703 align:middle line:90%
at least certified organic.

00:58:59.703 --> 00:59:02.105 align:middle line:90%
I mean, baseline, USDA organic.

00:59:02.105 --> 00:59:04.274 align:middle line:84%
When you're buying
things that say "natural,"

00:59:04.274 --> 00:59:05.909 align:middle line:90%
it means it has GMOs in it.

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:07.611 align:middle line:84%
There's lawsuits
over that right now.

00:59:07.611 --> 00:59:10.280 align:middle line:84%
When I see people in
the supermarket who go

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.983 align:middle line:84%
up to something like
Kashi and they buy it

00:59:12.983 --> 00:59:14.517 align:middle line:84%
because they think
there's no GMOs in it

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:15.952 align:middle line:90%
for some reason, you know.

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.654 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. I mean, there's no
indication that there's not.

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:19.589 align:middle line:84%
But it says a hundred
percent natural, you know,

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:21.958 align:middle line:84%
green environmental --
so many people get fooled

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:23.827 align:middle line:84%
by the labeling, even
hardened activists.

00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:26.363 align:middle line:84%
They think, for some reason,
that just because it appears

00:59:26.363 --> 00:59:27.998 align:middle line:90%
to be GMO-free, it is.

00:59:27.998 --> 00:59:29.399 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:32.636 align:middle line:84%
Even if says GMO-free, it has
to be non-GMO project verified.

00:59:32.636 --> 00:59:34.971 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. So get a hundred
percent USDA organic,

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:37.741 align:middle line:90%
if possible, or get local food.

00:59:37.741 --> 00:59:40.377 align:middle line:84%
But definitely, at least
increase the baseline level

00:59:40.377 --> 00:59:41.511 align:middle line:90%
to the point where it is organic

00:59:41.511 --> 00:59:43.613 align:middle line:84%
and you will eliminate
pretty much all GMOs.

00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:46.549 align:middle line:84%
Does USDA organic label
still mean something?

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:48.351 align:middle line:84%
It does. There's people
who say it doesn't.

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.754 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it doesn't in some
circumstances, but trust me,

00:59:50.754 --> 00:59:53.957 align:middle line:84%
you're eating better than
99.999% of the population

00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:55.191 align:middle line:90%
when you buy USDA organic.

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.527 align:middle line:84%
You have to be a little
picky for sure of what kind

00:59:57.527 --> 00:59:58.895 align:middle line:84%
of brands you're
getting with that seal

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.397 align:middle line:84%
because it could mean
different things depending

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:01.898 align:middle line:84%
on how much they care
about your health...

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:04.334 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. ...which is why it comes
down to different corporations

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.835 align:middle line:84%
and organizations when
you purchase things.

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.971 align:middle line:84%
But it does mean
something, for sure.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.339 align:middle line:90%
Hmm-mm. I mean, there's products

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:11.174 align:middle line:84%
that are high-quality
organic like, for example,

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:13.043 align:middle line:84%
we don't have the
USDA organic label

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:15.578 align:middle line:84%
because we choose ingredients
that are better than organic...

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.847 align:middle line:84%
Right. ...like wild
crafting and stuff like that.

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:19.382 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, it does
mean something.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.618 align:middle line:84%
So I would stick to
that as a baseline.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:24.487 align:middle line:84%
It eliminates pretty much
everything, from aspartame to,

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.523 align:middle line:84%
you know, other problematic
ingredients, as well.

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:28.324 align:middle line:84%
Hmm-mm. So, I mean, it's
not GMOs you're getting out.

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.826 align:middle line:84%
You're getting out high
fructose corn syrup

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.729 align:middle line:84%
which the  Washington Post
admits contains mercury.

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.631 align:middle line:84%
You're getting out
troves of garbage

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.066 align:middle line:84%
that you don't want
in your body.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.367 align:middle line:90%
So that's baseline.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:39.469 align:middle line:84%
Exactly. And again, you have
to be willing to put more

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:41.838 align:middle line:84%
of your disposable
income towards your food

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.339 align:middle line:84%
because organics
are more expensive.

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.341 align:middle line:84%
But, again, there's
nothing stopping people

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:46.810 align:middle line:84%
from having their
own backyard gardens.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:49.479 align:middle line:84%
I know. I mean, another
part of this psychology is

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.781 align:middle line:84%
to what degree do we want
to participate in the care

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.949 align:middle line:90%
and feeding of our own bodies...

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.517 align:middle line:84%
Yeah. ...and those
of our families.

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:57.287 align:middle line:84%
So, we're going to have
another conversation

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:59.089 align:middle line:84%
about how we can get
the stuff that's gotten

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.857 align:middle line:90%
in out of our bodies.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.459 align:middle line:84%
So, I want to thank
you for this one

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:03.727 align:middle line:84%
and for all the research
you've done.

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.361 align:middle line:90%
Yeah. Thanks for having me on.

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:14.437 align:middle line:90%
