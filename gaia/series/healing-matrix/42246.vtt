00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH:
I'm sure you've

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:84%
heard the arguments,
mostly ethical,

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.880 align:middle line:90%
about the subject of stem cells.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The science is still
emerging, but one big obstacle

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.590 align:middle line:84%
has been removed, that
of incompatibility

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:90%
between the patient and donor.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.740 align:middle line:84%
This has been made possible
through the gathering

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and storage of blood from
one's own umbilical cord.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a quick peek at
some video explaining this.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
>>You see, the
umbilical cord that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.350 align:middle line:84%
creates a lifeline
between mother and child

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
is rich with
blood-forming cells.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
These cells can be collected
from the umbilical cord

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:84%
after the baby is born
and used to help patients

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.010 align:middle line:84%
of all ages who are
fighting leukemia, lymphoma,

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and many other
life-threatening diseases.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Charis
Ober is here today

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
from the Save the Cord
Foundation in Tucson, Arizona

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.060 align:middle line:84%
to give us the background and
the potentials of this truly

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.322 align:middle line:90%
exciting area of medicine.

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:27.030 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
I've been intrigued

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
with for at least
the last decade.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And I've been waiting
for it to quiet down,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.390 align:middle line:84%
so we got rid of the arguments
around fetuses and so forth

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and got to something that
was genuinely, not only

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.090 align:middle line:84%
useful, but ethical
for all of us.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:90%
And it seems that we're there.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So we saw that little tiny
intro into, more or less,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.110 align:middle line:90%
how it's gathered.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
the process itself.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all, are there
any more ethical arguments

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.530 align:middle line:90%
before we get into the process?

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>>CHARIS OBER: Absolutely not.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Cord blood and cord
tissue stem cells

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:90%
are harvested from the body.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.240 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
uncontroversial.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.919 align:middle line:84%
And cord blood is
collected about 10 minutes

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.210 align:middle line:90%
after the birth of the child.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.180 align:middle line:84%
We have about 10 minutes
to collect these cells.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:84%
And then they're collected
in a sterile bag.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And then they are
cryogenically preserved.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And we can privately collect
our own children's cord blood

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
to be used as a family medical
resource for that child

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.080 align:middle line:90%
or another member of the family.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.050 align:middle line:90%
Or we can give the gift of life.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can donate
our baby's cord blood

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
at birth, which is a wonderful
gift that every mother can

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.700 align:middle line:90%
give.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when going back to
the ethical arguments about it,

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.970 align:middle line:84%
does this make the
old ways of gathering

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
stem cells basically
obsolete now?

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Well, with
cord blood we're always

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.559 align:middle line:84%
going to be collecting it right
after the birth of the child.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.225 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:56.220 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But we don't
need fetuses anymore?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: No, no, no, no.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's dead and gone.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.453 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Embryonic is just
completely another subject.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.267 align:middle line:84%
So all of these cells we're
going to be talking about today

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:90%
are all collected from the body.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.580 align:middle line:84%
They're uncontroversial and are
being used in incredible ways

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.080 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.204 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now we're going
to be talking about that.

00:03:13.204 --> 00:03:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about
the whole notion.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Once they've been gathered--
we saw that little tiny bit

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of video of how one
gathers the stem cells.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
process from there.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got that it has
to be within 10 minutes.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.580 align:middle line:90%
of the birth of the baby.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.030 align:middle line:84%
It's really critical because of
the living factors, I assume.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.327 align:middle line:84%
All the enzymes and
everything else involved?

00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.890 align:middle line:84%
These cells are collected from
the placenta and the cord.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
They're collected in
a large, sterile bag.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And then they are
shipped by courier

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
to either a private
cord blood bank, if it's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
a private collection, or to
a public cord blood bank.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
And they're there processed,
they are cryogenically

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.320 align:middle line:84%
preserved, and they can be
used for an indefinite period

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.360 align:middle line:84%
of time in the
future for a number

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.140 align:middle line:84%
of different medical
applications.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now this is a really
complex area of medicine.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
is that there

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.580 align:middle line:84%
has to be a certain level of
a type of cell count in order

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.040 align:middle line:84%
for that particular blood to
be utilized for stem cell work

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.259 align:middle line:84%
later on with that
body or family member.

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:90%
What is the requirement there?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.200 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: That's a great
question, Regina.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And it really goes
back and forth

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
between private banking
and public collection.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.680 align:middle line:84%
With private banking
when we collect

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:84%
our children's own
autologous stem cells,

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.475 align:middle line:84%
we can collect as
little or as much.

00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:36.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
very interested

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.810 align:middle line:84%
in the nucleated cell
count and the volume,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
but many times a very
small amount of cord blood

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.010 align:middle line:90%
may be collected.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.700 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand,
with public donation

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
a very large collection
is necessary to facilitate

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.730 align:middle line:90%
a transplant.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So right now transplanters are
looking at between 1.2 and 1.5

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.670 align:middle line:84%
billion cells per unit
of cord blood collected.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
The higher the new
nucleated cell count,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
the greater the chance of
a successful cord blood

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:90%
transplant.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.000 align:middle line:84%
Also with public
collection, most collections

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.170 align:middle line:90%
are at least 80 CCs to 100 CCs.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's a big difference
between private and public

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.300 align:middle line:84%
With the public because of the
FDA and government regulation,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.870 align:middle line:84%
they're very specific
about collecting

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.030 align:middle line:84%
cords that have a high cell
count and also large volume.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
If they don't meet
that, those cords

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.160 align:middle line:84%
may be used for some aspect
of stem cell research.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.507 align:middle line:84%
So no matter what
happens, it's a great gift

00:05:43.507 --> 00:05:44.340 align:middle line:90%
for any mom to give.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about that when

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.166 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about
stem cell research.

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:47.847 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Sure.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that look like?

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
What types of things are
they researching right now

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.940 align:middle line:84%
because-- well, first
of all, maybe you

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.550 align:middle line:84%
should get into the number
of ailments, diseases,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
chronic illnesses, and so forth
that it already addresses.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
So then we have an idea how
many and the types of illnesses

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.985 align:middle line:84%
that are being reversed
or helped by stem cells.

00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: All right.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we talk about
traditional transplant

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.670 align:middle line:84%
where we're donating
our baby's cord blood,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
right now it can be
used to treat and cure

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.360 align:middle line:90%
over 80 diseases.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.010 align:middle line:84%
Diseases like malignancies,
leukemia, lymphoma,

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.640 align:middle line:84%
blood disorders like sickle
cell anemia, immunodeficiencies,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.480 align:middle line:84%
autoimmune diseases, and a
lot of metabolic diseases,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
and storage diseases, and
also genetically inherited

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.966 align:middle line:84%
diseases can now be treated
with umbilical cord blood.

00:06:37.966 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if
you have a match,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and you have a person
that has a problem,

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.485 align:middle line:84%
some kind of illness, genetic
or otherwise, and once the match

00:06:46.485 --> 00:06:50.200 align:middle line:84%
is there, what is the
percentage of effectiveness

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.100 align:middle line:90%
with these procedures?

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Well, the cord blood
stem cells are very effective.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.920 align:middle line:84%
After they're collected,
a doctor is going to--

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:84%
and say the patient has
leukemia or lymphoma--

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the doctor's going to swab the
inside of that patient's cheek.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.990 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to take their
HLA, or human leukocyte

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:90%
antigen.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.230 align:middle line:84%
With that antigen, he's going
to go to an organization

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:90%
like Be the Match.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And he'll search for
another donor that

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:84%
has thought enough to donate
their baby's cord blood.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
look at the protein

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
markers that are
the HLA markers.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.979 align:middle line:84%
And then they will go
looking for a match.

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:90%
So that's how that works.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So once the match is
found, is it always effective?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: For the most
part, it's very effective.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.970 align:middle line:84%
With many of these patients
it's considered rescue therapy.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.615 align:middle line:84%
There really aren't any
other medical alternatives

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:48.325 align:middle line:90%
at this point.

00:07:48.325 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is one of those
end of the road treatments

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.717 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people when why
shouldn't it be the first?

00:07:53.717 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.047 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:55.047 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Let's talk about that.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.171 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: That would
depend on the physician.

00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And most of these patients with
leukemia, or lymphoma, or one

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
of the many diseases
that we talked

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:10.000 align:middle line:84%
about-- for those individuals
that have a lot of inherited

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:84%
or genetic diseases
like Hurler's or some

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:84%
of the metabolic
diseases, there really

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.090 align:middle line:84%
is no other medical
therapy available.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:84%
These children would
die within probably,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
who knows, a few months to a
few years after being born.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:90%
So it's really rescue therapy.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And when you were
mentioning some of the cancers

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:84%
earlier, if a person has
already been through chemo,

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
for example, and radiation,
is this still effective

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.740 align:middle line:84%
in rebuilding their immune
system from that point

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:84%
forward so it
doesn't happen again?

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.580 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Most definitely.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.290 align:middle line:84%
What's going to happen is
after that person has gone

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.210 align:middle line:84%
through traditional
therapies, they're

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.970 align:middle line:84%
going to-- and the physician
has decided that they're

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
a candidate for a cord
blood stem cell transplant,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
be ablated, meaning

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.704 align:middle line:84%
they're going to wipe out
their immune system completely.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going
to be transplanted

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.780 align:middle line:90%
with the donor cord blood.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And within a few days to a
month, engraftment takes place.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And those cells replace the
damaged or old immune system

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
and actually rebuild
that whole immune system,

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
giving that person a
whole new chance at life.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Oh now, to me,
that's just fascinating.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's go into the differences
between the-- you touched

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.830 align:middle line:84%
on it, but go into a
little larger explanation

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:84%
on the differences between
the private banking

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
system and the public
banking system.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're
pregnant, and you're

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:90%
going to have a baby.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about it from that
point and the options you have.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: OK.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you privately
bank, you have

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
to pay for having your
baby's cord blood stored.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
private banks out there.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.030 align:middle line:84%
What's going to
happen is Mom and Dad

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
are going to receive
a kit in the mail.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.200 align:middle line:84%
When Mom's going to take it
to the hospital with her,

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.170 align:middle line:84%
she's going to inform
her doctor that we

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
want to collect our
cord blood and use it

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.960 align:middle line:90%
as a family medical resource.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
After the baby's born when
we're waiting for the placenta

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
to come out, the doctor's
going to insert a needle

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.660 align:middle line:90%
into the cord.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And he's going to let gravity
drain the cord blood out

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.280 align:middle line:84%
of the placenta and the
umbilical cord tissue

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.330 align:middle line:90%
into a bag.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.620 align:middle line:90%
That'll be frozen.

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And then that cord blood
can be used specifically

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.010 align:middle line:84%
for that child, or for a
sibling, or family member.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:84%
There's a one in four
chance that a sibling

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.520 align:middle line:84%
may match that
child's cord blood.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.512 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:31.512 --> 00:10:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's how that
comes into play.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
either of the parents?

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:90%
That must be a more difficult--

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Probably.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.380 align:middle line:84%
All I've heard are the
statistics in one in four

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.800 align:middle line:90%
for a sibling or family member.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I would think it
would certainly be considerably

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.482 align:middle line:84%
further out for
either of the parents.

00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:47.065 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:47.606 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:10:47.606 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And so that is cryogenically
kept in a registry, right?

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Which is how-- I mean,
I read that Tucson's has like

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.587 align:middle line:84%
a half a million
samples there and--

00:11:00.587 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:01.669 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Tucson is very
fortunate to be home

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.600 align:middle line:84%
to one of the world's largest
private cord blood banks, cord

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.970 align:middle line:84%
blood registry, and they have
about a half million children's

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.155 align:middle line:90%
cords and cord tissue.

00:11:13.155 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
from all over the world?

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: From all over the world.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.344 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
privately banked.

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So parents all payed to have
their children's cord blood

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.990 align:middle line:90%
kept there.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And then once they pay a one
time processing fee initially

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:84%
upfront, then they
pay about $100 to $150

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.240 align:middle line:84%
a year just for storage
and maintenance.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's say
someone who lives maybe

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.660 align:middle line:84%
8 to 12 hours away
is now in need of it,

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.760 align:middle line:84%
they're going
through a procedure.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.790 align:middle line:90%
How does that work?

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I assume it has
to stay frozen right up

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.060 align:middle line:90%
until the point of use?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Before we
talk about that,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
once the cord is collected,
we have a 48 hour window

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
to get the cord
from Mom's bedside

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.209 align:middle line:84%
to either the private
bank or the public bank.

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:55.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: So any longer
than that, the cord blood

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.570 align:middle line:90%
becomes ineffective.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:90%
And it just doesn't work.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:90%
It's not going to do its job.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So there's that real
crucial window of time.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But with the innovation
of jet airplanes,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.150 align:middle line:84%
we can collect from all
over the world, and we do.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So about public
banking-- public banking

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.900 align:middle line:84%
is very rigidly
controlled by the FDA

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and other organizations.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And just like our
nation's blood supply,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:32.100 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for donors
that are in good health

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
and can provide us with cord
blood that is-- actually

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
donor mothers have to meet a
number of health criteria--

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.260 align:middle line:84%
that's the way I should put
it-- to be able to donate.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
So once that individual has
passed the health criteria,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.740 align:middle line:84%
then there are a
couple different ways

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.310 align:middle line:90%
it can be collected.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:84%
There are certain programs
where you can sign up

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
in advance from 28 weeks,
to 32 weeks, or 34 weeks,

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.830 align:middle line:84%
at the end of your
second trimester

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:06.880 align:middle line:90%
or at the end of your pregnancy.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.411 align:middle line:84%
You can contact
that public bank,

00:13:08.411 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and they'll send you, like I
said, the health questionnaire.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.690 align:middle line:84%
You have to fill all
the paperwork out.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.010 align:middle line:84%
If you pass, they'll
send you a kit.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
also public banks

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:84%
littered across
the United States

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.955 align:middle line:84%
where you can go in and
consent at the last minute.

00:13:21.955 --> 00:13:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And they actually
have consenters

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.450 align:middle line:84%
in the hospital that'll come
up and say, you know, Mary,

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.152 align:middle line:84%
you filled out the
health questionnaire.

00:13:29.152 --> 00:13:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to donate
your baby's cord blood

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.330 align:middle line:90%
and give life twice?

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
So that's how a
lot of cord blood

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:84%
is also collected at
the very last minute.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.919 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Now, is this
ever a monetary exchange

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:40.585 align:middle line:90%
with the mother?

00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:42.180 align:middle line:90%
Is it always a gift?

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.270 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Absolutely not.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.510 align:middle line:90%
Cord blood donation is free.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Mothers don't have
to pay anything.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But one more thing I wanted to
mention with public banking--

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:55.750 align:middle line:84%
as I said, there's a very high
sell threshold and also volume

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.520 align:middle line:90%
threshold.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
So unless that collection
is a very robust collection

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.190 align:middle line:84%
with a high
nucleated cell count,

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:84%
it probably either will
not make the registry,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
or it would be used for
cord blood research.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What percentage
of the public donations

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.730 align:middle line:84%
of this high percentage rate
actually make it through?

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Very few.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.840 align:middle line:90%
It's really quite sad.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's all because
of volume and cell count.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So I once heard a statistic,
and don't hold me to it, but out

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.700 align:middle line:84%
of 10 cores that are collected,
that maybe only one or two may

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:90%
ever make it to the registry.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's very expensive to
collect cord blood publicly.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a little over $3,000.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.649 align:middle line:84%
So if we collect 10 cords
and only two make it,

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:84%
those other cords,
you know, you have

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.030 align:middle line:90%
to pay for courier, for the kit.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And they may or may
not be processed.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of money
invested before those units

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.100 align:middle line:90%
ever even go to the registry.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Have they noticed
statistically what kind

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.510 align:middle line:84%
of donor-- is age a
factor, for example?

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.815 align:middle line:84%
What kind of donor tends to
have those higher cell counts?

00:15:02.815 --> 00:15:04.510 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And that's
a good question.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.386 align:middle line:84%
It's always an expectant mom
that's going to be donating.

00:15:07.386 --> 00:15:07.885 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:15:07.885 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, do
younger moms maybe

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.030 align:middle line:84%
have higher counts of the cells
in the placenta than older

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.530 align:middle line:90%
moms?

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.340 align:middle line:84%
I'm just wondering if
there are any factors

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.235 align:middle line:90%
that they've noticed.

00:15:16.235 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: You know, I--
Regina, I can't speak to that

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:90%
because I can't tell you that.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.620 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you one thing--
that 40% of all cord blood

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:29.460 align:middle line:84%
transplants are given to
individuals of ethnic minority.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 40%?

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.035 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: 40%.

00:15:31.035 --> 00:15:31.624 align:middle line:90%
All right?

00:15:31.624 --> 00:15:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Well, that's-- OK.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's an interesting
point because what percentage

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of the donors are also
ethnically matched,

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:41.920 align:middle line:90%
for example?

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: You keep
asking great questions.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Actually right now the
national cord blood inventory

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
is dramatically
underrepresented by individuals

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.480 align:middle line:84%
of ethnic minority and
blended individuals.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Right now we're all marrying out
of our ethnicities and races.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.540 align:middle line:90%
We're kind of a Heinz 57.

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And so if you are Caucasian,
there's a very high chance

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.330 align:middle line:84%
that if you get sick,
there's a very high chance

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:90%
that you'll be matched.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.490 align:middle line:84%
But if you're an individual
of ethnic minority,

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.120 align:middle line:90%
the chances drop dramatically.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.070 align:middle line:84%
So right now there's a big
push throughout the country

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:27.220 align:middle line:84%
at public donation banks
to go after those moms who

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.260 align:middle line:84%
are of ethnic
minority background

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.890 align:middle line:84%
or perhaps individuals
who are of mixed ethnicity

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:39.412 align:middle line:84%
so we can really build and
make our national registry as--

00:16:39.412 --> 00:16:41.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We need to have it
diverse is what you're saying.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.536 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Exactly.

00:16:42.536 --> 00:16:44.941 align:middle line:84%
We really need to make sure
that everyone's represented.

00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It sounds like it's
really a process of education.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
the public banks,

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
it's just a process
of education.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.325 align:middle line:84%
Who wouldn't want to
allow their-- well,

00:16:53.325 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:90%
we're going to get to that.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.320 align:middle line:84%
There are people who would
not want that to happen

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.880 align:middle line:84%
and for philosophical and
religious reasons that

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
need to be respected,
which we'll

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.940 align:middle line:90%
get to in just a little bit.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:84%
But I would like to
talk about a couple

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:08.754 align:middle line:84%
of particulars, a
couple of individuals

00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:84%
because we happen
to have a couple

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.760 align:middle line:90%
stories that we have photos for.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:90%
Most of them don't have photos.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about Luke Fryar.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.349 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: OK.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.670 align:middle line:90%
That's a great story.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Luke is a beautiful little boy.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:90%
You can see him.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.410 align:middle line:90%
He was born.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
His mom, Rachel Fryar had a
completely normal pregnancy.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.240 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when he was
born, the pediatrician

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.080 align:middle line:84%
came in and remarked how
incredibly strong and robust

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:90%
he was.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.100 align:middle line:84%
So Luke went home
with his mom and dad.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And Rachel started to
notice that Luke wasn't

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.640 align:middle line:84%
making his developmental
milestones.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.620 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't crawling,
he wasn't speaking,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and he didn't recognize
his right arm and leg.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
So at a nine month
well-baby check,

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Rachel reported this
to the pediatrician

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.710 align:middle line:84%
who told her that most likely
her son had cerebral palsy,

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and that he had incurred
a injury or insult either

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.980 align:middle line:84%
while he was being
carried in the womb

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.010 align:middle line:90%
or at the time of birth.

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So Rachel and her husband were
devastated, you can imagine.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, CP it's a real
horrific situation.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
So Rachel had privately
banked Luke's cord blood.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And she, being a nurse, went
out and started researching

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and found out about
a clinical trial that

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:84%
was going on at Duke University
that was headed by Dr. Joanne

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Kurtzberg, who is a hematologist
oncologist pediatrician.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
Rachel with Luke,

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.046 align:middle line:84%
and he's getting his
cord blood transfusion

00:18:42.046 --> 00:18:45.050 align:middle line:84%
of his own autologous
stem cells.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And so what happened is, within
a very short period of time,

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.040 align:middle line:90%
these cells engrafted.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And you can see Dr. Kurtzberg
is second from the left,

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.120 align:middle line:84%
and then Rachel and
her husband Colby,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and little Luke with Dr.
Kurtzberg's colleagues

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:01.870 align:middle line:90%
there at Duke.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:06.040 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a great
story because Luke is now

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.480 align:middle line:84%
walking, and talking,
and riding a bike.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And unless you knew that he had
actually suffered this injury

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
at birth, you would
not know that there

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.340 align:middle line:90%
was anything wrong with Luke.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I mean,
talk about a new life,

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.010 align:middle line:84%
given a real chance
at an active life.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And as I was going through
researching for this,

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.770 align:middle line:84%
I came across a news
video on Chloe Levine,

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:90%
I think her name was.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.790 align:middle line:90%
And also cerebral palsy.

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And her mother was explaining
how quick the procedure was.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this wasn't a
drawn out procedure.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:45.660 align:middle line:84%
They'd already
been through a lot.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And so when it came
this time, this

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.730 align:middle line:84%
was again a last
ditch kind of effort.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.530 align:middle line:84%
But she said they went
in, and the injections

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.400 align:middle line:84%
took place over a couple
hours, something like this.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And then within days that Chloe
started regaining her mobility.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.180 align:middle line:84%
That's shocking to think
it can happen that quickly

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
when families have been
through so much trying just

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.830 align:middle line:84%
for a glimpse of hope
in mobility again.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: It can
really change lives.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing this
with so many aspects

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
of neurological
deficit or damage

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
at birth that these stem cells
intrinsically know how to home

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
right to that damaged
part of the brain.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And they go up and repair that.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.386 align:middle line:90%
And it's really a miracle.

00:20:29.386 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's an amazing
system of intelligence

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.879 align:middle line:90%
guided by who knows what.

00:20:34.879 --> 00:20:37.420 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And, you know, there
are some skeptics out there that

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.760 align:middle line:84%
say well, maybe
this is anecdotal.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this would
have happened anyway.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:47.080 align:middle line:84%
But many of these children
have very severe paralysis.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.080 align:middle line:84%
As with Luke, he could
not walk, talk, or did not

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.010 align:middle line:84%
even recognize his
right arm or leg.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And then after the transfusion,
within a very short period

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.580 align:middle line:84%
of time, you start to see
these amazing responses.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The body's own
unique intelligence forces.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: It is because, you
know, really cord blood is

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:06.790 align:middle line:84%
a renewable resource
that can be repurposed.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.660 align:middle line:84%
It's a green product, really,
if you think about it.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.500 align:middle line:90%
So it really is.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful
product out there.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: So I have a question.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.242 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if you
can answer this or not.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe you can
answer very quickly.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.310 align:middle line:84%
So say I'm a mom, and
I don't have the money

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
privately bank, but I

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.140 align:middle line:90%
do want to make that offering.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.490 align:middle line:90%
So I publicly donate.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:36.350 align:middle line:84%
And let's say my particular
sample has a high cell count,

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and has made it through,
has a number stamped on it.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.780 align:middle line:84%
What if my child that that
came from becomes ill,

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:49.100 align:middle line:84%
will I ever have access
to that public cord blood

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:90%
to those stem cells?

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Yes.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.700 align:middle line:84%
If the cord made
it to the registry,

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and it is sitting in a
cryogenically preserved doer,

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.470 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.960 align:middle line:84%
You can have your
cord blood back,

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.137 align:middle line:84%
but because so few of these
cords make the criteria--

00:22:04.137 --> 00:22:05.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It gets
used up pretty fast.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.510 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the risky part of it.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:08.783 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:22:08.783 --> 00:22:09.950 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so if it's
your own cord blood-- I just

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.320 align:middle line:84%
want to reiterate this-- if
it's your own cord blood,

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.130 align:middle line:84%
you're the baby
now, and you end up

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:23.220 align:middle line:84%
like Luke here and like Chloe,
because it's an absolute match,

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.574 align:middle line:84%
will it absolutely work
for the problem at hand?

00:22:26.574 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It will.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:33.310 align:middle line:84%
It's the individual key that
is unique to that one child.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Just like no two snowflakes
are alike in nature,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:40.160 align:middle line:84%
the same thing is
with our cord blood.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And so your own
autologous cord blood

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:84%
is really the key to unlock
many of these situations

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.974 align:middle line:90%
like you see with Luke.

00:22:50.974 --> 00:22:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Now one thing I
want to point out,

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
when you're privately
banking, and your child were

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.500 align:middle line:84%
to be diagnosed with
one of these cancers,

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.930 align:middle line:84%
or one of these chronic, or
life-threatening diseases,

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
you probably would not want to
use that child's cord blood.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Right because there's
some damage to begin with.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Exactly.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But in a situation like
that, maybe a sibling

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.790 align:middle line:84%
might have leukemia, or
lymphoma, or situation.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And then that child's
cord blood could

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:84%
be used, if it was a
match, for that sibling.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.980 align:middle line:90%
That's a great application.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The other thing with private
is the regenerative side,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.577 align:middle line:84%
which we're seeing an
explosion right now.

00:23:26.577 --> 00:23:27.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:27.660 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.990 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I want to get into
another very quirky example

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.700 align:middle line:84%
of a man who had AIDS that's
just an amazing story.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: He's so inspirational.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:38.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: He is.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
regenerative side of it.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are other ways, aside
from umbilical cord blood,

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to gather our own stem
cells from adipose tissues.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.240 align:middle line:84%
We were talking off
camera where if you

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%
have a little bit of extra fluff
on the tummy, under the arms,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.750 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, that tissue is
actually ripe with these cells,

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:58.250 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.550 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.383 align:middle line:84%
Actually those are a
different type of cell.

00:24:00.383 --> 00:24:01.920 align:middle line:90%
Those are mesenchymal cells.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:05.360 align:middle line:84%
But those also are a
wonderful building block

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.600 align:middle line:90%
for other aspects of the body.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Before we go
into adipose tissue,

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.620 align:middle line:84%
what would they be
used for, for example?

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Those would be used
for say regeneration of muscle,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:27.470 align:middle line:84%
tissue, bone,
cartilage, and tendons.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.107 align:middle line:90%
So that's--

00:24:28.107 --> 00:24:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More structural.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
More structural,
where the CD34 stem

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.730 align:middle line:84%
cells found in umbilical
cord blood are repairing.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying that the
umbilical cord blood can also

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.040 align:middle line:84%
be used for normal
regenerative processes

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.850 align:middle line:90%
in adults, even healthy adults?

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: I can't
really speak to that.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:84%
What I can speak to is they're
also using children's own

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.930 align:middle line:84%
autologous, or same cell
stem cells-- stem cells--

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.810 align:middle line:84%
that are privately banked to
treat kids with traumatic brain

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.657 align:middle line:90%
injury, type 1 diabetes--

00:25:01.657 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Spinal
cord injuries, right?

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.323 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Now spinal cord
is a little bit different.

00:25:05.323 --> 00:25:06.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: And also hearing loss.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.980 align:middle line:84%
And there are many trials
going on across the nation

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.650 align:middle line:84%
and around the world where
researchers and scientists are

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.690 align:middle line:84%
looking at so many
different applications

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.320 align:middle line:90%
for a regenerative medicine.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well now, let's
go into spinal cords.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Yes.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.659 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:22.659 --> 00:25:27.254 align:middle line:84%
There's a physician by the name
of Dr. Wise Young from Rutgers.

00:25:27.254 --> 00:25:29.170 align:middle line:84%
And he's doing a tremendous
amount of research

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:30.700 align:middle line:90%
right now in China.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
about it is in China

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
there are literally
hundreds of thousands

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.380 align:middle line:84%
of patients who have been
injured, whether it's a mining

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:84%
accident or an
industrial accident.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And because they do not have
the FDA regulation there,

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.410 align:middle line:84%
scientists and
physicians are able to do

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.110 align:middle line:84%
a lot more experimental
type of medicine there.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.545 align:middle line:84%
So what Dr. Wise Young is doing
is he's taking allogeneic,

00:25:57.545 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
or donated cord blood, because
these are adult patients who

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.310 align:middle line:90%
have incurred an injury.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So they wouldn't have saved
their umbilical cord blood.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So he's going and
finding a match.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.570 align:middle line:84%
And then what he's doing
is injecting these cells

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.270 align:middle line:84%
into the damaged
part of the spine.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And I believe
there's also lithium

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.750 align:middle line:84%
that's also been given
at the same time.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.090 align:middle line:84%
But you're basically
seeing patients

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:28.110 align:middle line:84%
that were paraplegics and
quadriplegic up and walking.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And I had an opportunity
to talk to Dr. Young.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was saying
to me we really

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.220 align:middle line:84%
don't know the ideology
of how these cells work,

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.850 align:middle line:90%
but they work.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.058 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: But they work, yes.

00:26:37.058 --> 00:26:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: We don't know if
they actually signal the body

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.900 align:middle line:84%
and say regrow these damaged
parts of the spinal cord.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.410 align:middle line:84%
A big part of the therapy is
after these patients receive

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:52.070 align:middle line:84%
these donated stem cells for
their spinal cord injury,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.360 align:middle line:84%
they get them up,
and they're walking.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And they walk for six
to eight hours a day.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:84%
They have a special
type of a brace on.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're actually walked
with another physical therapist.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the body is doing
some kind of memory pattern

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.210 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: It's saying
hey, wake up.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.050 align:middle line:90%
These cells are here.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.190 align:middle line:84%
We're here to regenerate,
repair, and fix

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.389 align:middle line:90%
this part of the spinal cord.

00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What's
interesting there-- you're

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.721 align:middle line:84%
talking about in
China where you have

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.414 align:middle line:84%
a more homogeneous
racial group generally

00:27:22.414 --> 00:27:24.330 align:middle line:84%
than what you would find
in the United States.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:24.996 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Exactly.

00:27:24.996 --> 00:27:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there must be a
higher percentage of matches

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.570 align:middle line:90%
from public donation.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.650 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Exactly,
but I would imagine

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.640 align:middle line:84%
if you had saved your
children's own stem cells,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.050 align:middle line:84%
there may be an
application for autologous,

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.205 align:middle line:84%
or same cell stem cells, since
they would be your own cells.

00:27:41.205 --> 00:27:42.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: I'm not a scientist.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm only an
advocate, but I would

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.650 align:middle line:84%
imagine there may be an
application for that too.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about autism

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:52.430 align:middle line:84%
and the Sutter
hospitals in Sacramento

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.982 align:middle line:84%
because I was watching
a few videos on that

00:27:54.982 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:90%
and reading about that.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.487 align:middle line:84%
That does sound like it
has a huge potential.

00:27:58.487 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.570 align:middle line:90%
That's being done by a Dr. Chez.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And he's looking at
both boys and girls.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.680 align:middle line:84%
Ages, I believe it's
one year of age and up.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.510 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing a
double-blind crossover study.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.300 align:middle line:84%
So they won't know
when the children

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.030 align:middle line:84%
get their own
umbilical cord blood.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.690 align:middle line:84%
They'll either receive a placebo
upfront or their own cord

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:21.190 align:middle line:90%
blood.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:22.690 align:middle line:90%
And then there's a crossover.

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they,
again, will either

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.050 align:middle line:84%
receive a placebo
or their stem cells.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
The data that has not
been collected yet.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:84%
We haven't really heard
anything back, but obviously

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.380 align:middle line:84%
for parents of
children with autism,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.800 align:middle line:84%
this may be a
therapy that may help

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.740 align:middle line:84%
to unlock this puzzling and
terrible disease that afflicts

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.322 align:middle line:84%
so many kids now,
especially boys.

00:28:48.322 --> 00:28:50.530 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: A couple of the
reports I was reading about

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.370 align:middle line:84%
had to do specifically
with-- and you

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.270 align:middle line:84%
know about this--
it's controversial,

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.710 align:middle line:84%
but it seems to be getting more
legs with the massive number

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.820 align:middle line:84%
of injections that a child is
getting in their early years,

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.500 align:middle line:84%
prior to going to
school, vaccinations.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And then the onset of
Asperger's and autism.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's showing
that with stem cells,

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.420 align:middle line:84%
it's even reversing the effects
after that kind of exposure.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's really exciting.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.720 align:middle line:84%
It's doing something to override
whatever that program is

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.960 align:middle line:84%
that got in there,
whether it's vaccines,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:90%
or whether it's something else.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:25.562 align:middle line:84%
So just because they've
had vaccines doesn't mean

00:29:25.562 --> 00:29:26.520 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to work.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It is working, which
is exciting for parents

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.657 align:middle line:84%
to know because it's
such a hard issue.

00:29:31.657 --> 00:29:32.240 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It is.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And basically every day
when I get on the computer

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:40.000 align:middle line:84%
there is a new trial, a new
study, a new application,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.780 align:middle line:84%
a new reason to say
why not our own cells,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.740 align:middle line:90%
or why not these donated cells?

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.180 align:middle line:84%
When I first started the
foundation seven or eight years

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.570 align:middle line:84%
ago, there were only
probably 50 plus diseases

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.940 align:middle line:84%
that were being treated
with stem cells.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.850 align:middle line:90%
Now we're up to almost 80.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And with the regenerative
side, every day

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.820 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing more and more
applications for children,

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:04.400 align:middle line:90%
like I said.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:84%
Like Luke that
basically in the past

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.420 align:middle line:84%
were resigned to
a wheelchair, had

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.210 align:middle line:90%
a diminished quality of life.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And so now we know cord
blood cannot only save lives,

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:15.897 align:middle line:90%
but we can change lives too.

00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:16.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.480 align:middle line:90%
OK, let's talk about Tim Brown.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.247 align:middle line:90%
This is such an unusual case.

00:30:20.247 --> 00:30:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: There he is.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:21.960 align:middle line:90%
He's my hero.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I had the chance to
meet Tim two years ago.

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Tim is probably one of
the most amazing stories

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.810 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
talking about today.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Tim was diagnosed with
both HIV and leukemia.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
He was living in Berlin, Germany
when he became very, very ill.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And he's known as
the Berlin patient.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:48.580 align:middle line:84%
His doctor, Dr. Huetter, went
looking for a match for Tim.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And Tim actually didn't
receive cord blood.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
He received adult
peripheral stem cells,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.420 align:middle line:84%
which is another
type of cell that we

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.960 align:middle line:90%
can harvest from the body.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
In all the world,
Regina, this is

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:03.460 align:middle line:84%
what's so incredible-- in
all the world, less than 1%

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.380 align:middle line:84%
of the human race carries
this very special allele.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a mutated allele
called the CCR5 allele.

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.807 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's an allele?

00:31:12.807 --> 00:31:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It's a gene.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And this gene
basically provides

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:21.359 align:middle line:90%
a immunity to the HIV virus.

00:31:21.359 --> 00:31:22.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 1% of the population.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: 1% of the population.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And both Mom and
Dad have to express

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.050 align:middle line:90%
this gene in the offspring.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And the offspring donated their
adult peripheral stem cells.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:84%
But we now know that
cord blood from a baby,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.760 align:middle line:84%
from a mom and dad
that both carried

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.940 align:middle line:90%
this CCR5 allele works too.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:46.159 align:middle line:84%
So right now there's a
huge rush on globally--

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was just
going to ask you that.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:52.130 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: --globally, looking
at all of the public banks

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:55.270 align:middle line:84%
to find more of
these super donors.

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And I think, to
date, they have now

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.899 align:middle line:90%
identified over 200 of them.

00:31:59.899 --> 00:32:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Fabulous.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.335 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: And so--

00:32:01.335 --> 00:32:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
talk about what happened.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Well, what happened
is it's living proof.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.890 align:middle line:90%
He's alive and well today.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And he was actually
matched to 260 individuals,

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.300 align:middle line:90%
but the 261st was a super donor.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And that super donor's
adult peripheral stem cells

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.880 align:middle line:90%
were transplanted into Tim.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And within a short
period of time,

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.470 align:middle line:90%
it rebuilt his immune system.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Did they know
this was a super donor?

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.030 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: They did.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They did?

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:29.727 align:middle line:90%
So that had been identified?

00:32:29.727 --> 00:32:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke to
Tim two years ago.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:37.089 align:middle line:84%
And when I was talking
to him, I said gee, Tim,

00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:38.880 align:middle line:84%
you must feel like
you're one in a million.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.880 align:middle line:90%
And he started laughing.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.620 align:middle line:90%
He said I'm one in a billion.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:42.137 align:middle line:90%
And so--

00:32:42.137 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about what happened.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.315 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: OK.

00:32:44.315 --> 00:32:44.856 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:44.856 --> 00:32:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So once he had the
cell transplant, then

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.630 align:middle line:90%
what happened to his body?

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.280 align:middle line:90%
How did it start recovering?

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And what was the speed at which
it recovered, and all of that?

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Well, he recovered both
from his leukemia and his HIV

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:90%
infection.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.077 align:middle line:84%
To date, he has never shown
any positive sign of HIV.

00:33:02.077 --> 00:33:03.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Did it happen quickly?

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.175 align:middle line:84%
Was it relatively
quickly, or for months?

00:33:05.175 --> 00:33:07.955 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: It happened
within a while.

00:33:07.955 --> 00:33:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The adult peripheral
cells needed to engraft.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And then they rebuilt a
whole new immune system.

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So whoever that donor was,
Tim took on the blood type,

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:23.700 align:middle line:84%
and kind of, I should
say, the cellular identity

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.060 align:middle line:90%
of that individual who donated.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.180 align:middle line:90%
And today he's well and alive.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:32.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's out talking to
others about hopefully this

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.420 align:middle line:84%
will be a path for
us to cure AIDS.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:37.840 align:middle line:84%
34 million people are
affected in the world.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.340 align:middle line:84%
Imagine what that
one man could do.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.730 align:middle line:90%
I mean, with what happened.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But one the areas
that is not so much esoteric,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.630 align:middle line:84%
but it has to do with deep
belief systems, and practices,

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.040 align:middle line:84%
and indigenous, and
even ancient cultures.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do with the
retention of the umbilical cord

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.880 align:middle line:84%
after birth where this
is a cherished item that

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:90%
stays within the household.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they hold onto
that for even up to a year.

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And the Native American
culture has some of this.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.699 align:middle line:84%
And this has been interesting
for you from my understanding

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:14.600 align:middle line:84%
because there is a dearth
of Native American cord

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.300 align:middle line:84%
blood available to the public,
the people that need it

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.909 align:middle line:90%
from within their population.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:23.965 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you
have this religious kind

00:34:23.965 --> 00:34:28.080 align:middle line:84%
of right and ceremony
around the placenta

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.560 align:middle line:90%
and the umbilical cord.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.959 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about how
these two interface?

00:34:31.959 --> 00:34:32.500 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Yeah.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.480 align:middle line:90%
That's a really great point.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.210 align:middle line:84%
First of all, our
ethnic minorities

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:38.190 align:middle line:84%
are dramatically
underrepresented.

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
that we collect

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.830 align:middle line:84%
from all these ethnicities, our
Native Americans especially.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Within their heritage and
their religious beliefs,

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.489 align:middle line:84%
they are very sensitive
and respectful

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.320 align:middle line:84%
to the umbilical cord
and the placenta.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: I actually
had an opportunity

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to speak to several
tribal members.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.470 align:middle line:84%
And they hold these
tissues sacred.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And they believe that the
children's identity and spirit

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.127 align:middle line:84%
lie within this umbilical
cord, this cord of life.

00:35:06.127 --> 00:35:06.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And they have
many different, depending

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.360 align:middle line:84%
on the particular
tribe-- but they actually

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.580 align:middle line:84%
will take the cord and the
placenta home with them

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:84%
from the hospital if they're
doing a traditional birth

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:84%
at a hospital and bury
it in the backyard.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And they feel like that grounds
their child's spirit on earth.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:32.010 align:middle line:84%
If can somehow bridge the
cultural and religious gap

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:37.830 align:middle line:84%
with the educational perspective
and teach that these stem

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.681 align:middle line:90%
cells can save somebody's life--

00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:42.680 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And maybe make
a new kind of ceremony.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.327 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the ceremony
expands in a new way.

00:35:45.327 --> 00:35:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
it's possible.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:47.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:48.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's just a--

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.268 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Evolving.

00:35:49.268 --> 00:35:49.827 align:middle line:90%
Evolving.

00:35:49.827 --> 00:35:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:53.835 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And we know
that, as I said before,

00:35:53.835 --> 00:35:57.750 align:middle line:84%
40% of all individuals who
receive cord blood transplants

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.030 align:middle line:90%
are ethnic minorities.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
there's a better

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:06.190 align:middle line:84%
chance of matching if we
look for individuals that

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.036 align:middle line:84%
are of the same
race or ethnicity.

00:36:08.036 --> 00:36:09.910 align:middle line:84%
There's obviously going
to be a better match.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:10.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Now this extends beyond human
beings to animals as well.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about animals.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.080 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: OK.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, I had the opportunity to
meet a wonderful individual,

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.010 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Wayne Mcilwraith.

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And he's actually here in
Colorado at the Colorado State

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.300 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.050 align:middle line:84%
He's the world authority
on orthopedic applications

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.490 align:middle line:84%
for a little bit
different type of a cell,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:35.509 align:middle line:90%
a bone marrow derived stem cell.

00:36:35.509 --> 00:36:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:39.290 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And these cells
can go and basically take

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:43.710 align:middle line:84%
a damaged racehorse that has
perhaps hurt himself in a race

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and either wouldn't be
a candidate for any kind

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.230 align:middle line:84%
of a surgical intervention and
would probably be destroyed,

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.910 align:middle line:84%
may have a second chance at
rebuilding, regenerating,

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.780 align:middle line:84%
regrowing, repairing
that damaged joint.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.654 align:middle line:84%
And that's the man
who's doing it.

00:36:59.654 --> 00:37:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are they having
pretty good success at it?

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Excellent.

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.150 align:middle line:90%
Excellent success.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I had an opportunity
of hearing him speak

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.090 align:middle line:84%
and was absolutely so
touched to see the work

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:11.490 align:middle line:90%
he's doing here in Colorado.

00:37:11.490 --> 00:37:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And how he's really
giving horses,

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.790 align:middle line:84%
the equine community,
really a second chance

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:84%
at being able to
rehabilitate and return-- I

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.980 align:middle line:90%
was really shocked.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.700 align:middle line:84%
He opened his talk with
this beautiful racehorse

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.210 align:middle line:84%
that was flying through the
finish line in first place.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.150 align:middle line:84%
The next picture was
this horse, and it

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.330 align:middle line:84%
had been damaged
with a huge bandage.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was not a positive
prognosis for surgery.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.590 align:middle line:84%
And then after this
stem cell therapy,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.530 align:middle line:90%
he then showed the last slide.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.937 align:middle line:84%
And it was this same horse
again winning a race.

00:37:44.937 --> 00:37:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wow.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.025 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: So the
regenerative power

00:37:47.025 --> 00:37:49.980 align:middle line:84%
is there, although these
are not cord blood stem

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.840 align:middle line:84%
cells-- these are
other cells that

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:84%
are held within the body that
have these same properties

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.180 align:middle line:90%
to rebuild and regenerate.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's talk
about the collection

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.431 align:middle line:84%
of stem cells from adipose
tissue from fat a little bit.

00:38:03.431 --> 00:38:03.930 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: OK.

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, once again, that's
a different type of cell.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, I understand.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.430 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: But that comes
into the jigglies

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:90%
that we have on our body.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.900 align:middle line:90%
That--

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.670 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The extra fluff.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.160 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Exactly.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.740 align:middle line:84%
That is actually
taken from the body.

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:23.250 align:middle line:90%
It's removed from the body.

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.800 align:middle line:84%
It's vacuumed out,
and then it can

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.570 align:middle line:84%
be also processed and
cryogenically preserved,

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and to be used in a number
of different regenerative

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:36.780 align:middle line:84%
applications for
that individual.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's also
very promising too.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And once again, uncontroversial
and something that

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:84%
could possibly be
stored to be used

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:47.685 align:middle line:84%
either for a chronic or acute
situation now or in the future.

00:38:47.685 --> 00:38:48.810 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's interesting.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And does it have the same
type of percentage of match,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.440 align:middle line:84%
or more or less, say,
than umbilical cord blood.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.960 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Well, again, if it's
a autologous or, in this

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:84%
horse's situation, because we're
putting those same cells back--

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.664 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Back into
our own bodies.

00:39:04.664 --> 00:39:05.580 align:middle line:90%
It should be the same.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.163 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:39:06.163 --> 00:39:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.100 align:middle line:84%
With donation,
there is sometimes

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.100 align:middle line:84%
a situation called
graft versus host

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:84%
where the donated cord blood
actually attacks the body

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and can cause some very
significant life-threatening

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.840 align:middle line:90%
situations.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So that can happen with
donated cord blood,

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.460 align:middle line:84%
but what you're seeing
with the horse application

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:84%
is actually they're
taking their own cells

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and then, again,
repurposing them to be used.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So best if we're
going to use the cells

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.217 align:middle line:84%
from adipose tissue
that it's our own?

00:39:40.217 --> 00:39:40.800 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:44.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And is that
also an expensive process

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.287 align:middle line:90%
to have those extracted?

00:39:46.287 --> 00:39:46.870 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It is.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.269 align:middle line:84%
And, as I said, I'm not
too familiar with that.

00:39:50.269 --> 00:39:52.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah because I know
cord blood is your thing.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:52.900 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.930 align:middle line:84%
But I do know that there's a
tremendous amount of research

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:01.420 align:middle line:84%
going on with that with a
lot of different applications

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.270 align:middle line:84%
looking at Parkinson's
and some other diseases.

00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:08.320 align:middle line:84%
So who knows what the
future lies ahead of us.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's so exciting because just
a few years ago individuals

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:84%
that had leukemia that
didn't respond died.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:18.830 align:middle line:84%
I actually saw something where
it showed in the early '60s,

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:84%
it had to ten different
life-threatening diseases,

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and what your rate
of survival was.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:29.160 align:middle line:84%
And then today in
2014, I couldn't

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.540 align:middle line:84%
believe how the statistics
had been swapped.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And that so many people
are surviving and going on

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.600 align:middle line:84%
to live totally normal
lives because of donation,

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.240 align:middle line:84%
or because somebody
thought enough to donate.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.639 align:middle line:90%
So it's really incredible.

00:40:46.639 --> 00:40:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Outside of
that rejection factor,

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.763 align:middle line:84%
you talked about if it's a
donor from the outside, which

00:40:50.763 --> 00:40:51.720 align:middle line:90%
does happen.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Is that something
that's common, or is

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.110 align:middle line:84%
rare to have that kind of
a really extreme reaction

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.300 align:middle line:90%
to someone else's cell?

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.470 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It does happen.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.930 align:middle line:90%
And it happens a lot more than--

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Can it be reversed?

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.337 align:middle line:84%
Say you go this route,
now it's attacking you--

00:41:07.337 --> 00:41:07.920 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.120 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a physician.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And I can't really
speak to that.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:17.770 align:middle line:84%
But it can be a very horrific
event that takes place.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Don't they take
some samples of your own cells

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and do something in a
Petri dish or something

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:84%
before that to make sure
that's not a potential?

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Well, here's the deal.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.556 align:middle line:84%
With bone marrow,
you have to have

00:41:28.556 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
a perfect match,
eight our of eight.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.940 align:middle line:84%
With cord blood, we
can have a mismatch.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.314 align:middle line:84%
We can have up to
four out of six.

00:41:35.314 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.000 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: So within that
mismatch, sometimes we

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.370 align:middle line:84%
find a six out of six
or a five out of six,

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:44.280 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes even within a
mismatched or a perfect cord,

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:48.310 align:middle line:84%
there may still be
a slight variance.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And so there's always
that possibility

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.830 align:middle line:90%
of graph versus host.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:53.350 align:middle line:90%
So it's always there.

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:54.600 align:middle line:90%
It's always going to be there.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
talk about costs,

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.730 align:middle line:84%
getting down to the
numbers part of it.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Love to.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what it costs
for a family to privately

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.587 align:middle line:84%
bank the cord blood for
their child or their family.

00:42:06.587 --> 00:42:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.050 align:middle line:90%
It varies.

00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:84%
If you get on the internet,
it can be anywhere

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:13.200 align:middle line:90%
from $1,000 to $2,000.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.810 align:middle line:84%
I would say to parents
be very discriminating

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.720 align:middle line:84%
about the private
bank you choose.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's what I
was just going to ask you.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.401 align:middle line:84%
How do you know it's
a reputable one?

00:42:21.401 --> 00:42:24.267 align:middle line:84%
Is there some agency
that oversees these, or--

00:42:24.267 --> 00:42:24.850 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:25.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:25.830 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:29.440 align:middle line:84%
They are all regulated by a
number of different licensing

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and accrediting organizations.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And make sure that your bank has
been in business for a while,

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:43.082 align:middle line:84%
that it meets all of the
regulatory requirements needed.

00:42:43.082 --> 00:42:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Make sure
that it's accredited,

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:middle line:90%
it's been around for a while.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.055 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Exactly.

00:42:46.055 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it costs
from $1,000 to $2,000

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:51.260 align:middle line:84%
to have it harvested, and
gathered, and then stored.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.612 align:middle line:84%
And then about $100
to $150 a year?

00:42:53.612 --> 00:42:55.070 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Right, for
the storage fee.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And you pay a one time
processing fee upfront.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, yearly, you pay
a yearly processing fee,

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.950 align:middle line:90%
anywhere between $100 and $150.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:07.730 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the
private bank you select.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.142 align:middle line:84%
They all have
different programs.

00:43:09.142 --> 00:43:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
it doesn't seem

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
like it's that outrageous a cost
when you look at the potentials

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.390 align:middle line:84%
if you have the money,
disposable income when you're

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.470 align:middle line:90%
having a baby.

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And we talked about
something off camera

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.240 align:middle line:90%
that I thought sounded so cool.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And it had to do with a
new kind of baby shower.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about that for just
a moment before we wrap up.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.391 align:middle line:90%
It's a great idea.

00:43:32.391 --> 00:43:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Because the
number one thing

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.340 align:middle line:84%
I hear with family
banking or private banking

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:90%
is it's so expensive.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.010 align:middle line:84%
But I think that parents really
need to prioritize and really

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.140 align:middle line:90%
think about, say, $2,000.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:52.770 align:middle line:84%
Did you buy that expensive
crib that was $1,000 or $1,500.

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Think of all of
the gifts that you

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:58.180 align:middle line:84%
are given during your
pregnancy and afterwards,

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.830 align:middle line:84%
all the onesies that are
spit up on, or the child

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:03.690 align:middle line:84%
grows out of-- literally
hundreds and sometimes

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.470 align:middle line:84%
thousands of dollars
worth of gifts.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.610 align:middle line:84%
So we are now saying to
parents hey, what about a cord

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.540 align:middle line:84%
blood shower where friends
and family, coworkers

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:18.840 align:middle line:84%
can give as little or as
much to a husband and wife

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.750 align:middle line:90%
and help them to--

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:23.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Essentially gather the
resources to buy the service.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.557 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a great idea.

00:44:25.557 --> 00:44:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Right.

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:26.480 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are people
starting to buy into this?

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:28.909 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: They really are.

00:44:28.909 --> 00:44:31.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the banks
have shower programs

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and different financial
programs that young parents

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.970 align:middle line:90%
can investigate.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And I just say that
you have one chance

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.930 align:middle line:84%
at the birth of your
child, one chance

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.470 align:middle line:90%
to collect these precious cells.

00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And I can only
tell you every week

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.710 align:middle line:84%
I get parents calling me
who have children that

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:56.150 align:middle line:84%
have suffered debilitating
injuries at birth.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:59.040 align:middle line:84%
And the first question
I ask them is did you

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.650 align:middle line:90%
save your child's cord blood?

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And when I hear no, I
really can't offer them

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:middle line:84%
any kind of answer
to their question.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.914 align:middle line:84%
For the regenerative side,
for CP, and some of these--

00:45:11.914 --> 00:45:14.330 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: They can go to a
public bank, and give it a try,

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and see if there's
a match, but--

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.520 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It wouldn't work.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:16.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not the same.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.110 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It wouldn't work.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.403 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It would not work.

00:45:19.403 --> 00:45:21.380 align:middle line:84%
You must have your own
child's cord blood.

00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:28.090 align:middle line:84%
It is the only key to unlock
this type of damage with CP

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and traumatic brain injury,
those types of situations.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.570 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.500 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Well, I think
it's all about education.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And the foundation
really wants to make

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.630 align:middle line:84%
collecting cord blood
and cord blood education

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.210 align:middle line:84%
the standard of
care for every woman

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.750 align:middle line:84%
everywhere to be able to have
the opportunity to donate,

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:90%
to give life twice.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And also the
foundation really wants

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.540 align:middle line:84%
to make education
a priority and not

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.170 align:middle line:90%
just educate expectant parents.

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But we really need to go to
the next generation, Regina.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And we need to talk to young
men, and women, and students

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:08.450 align:middle line:84%
everywhere about the fact that
these are important cells.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:10.050 align:middle line:90%
This is our future.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:11.922 align:middle line:84%
We are at the tip of
the iceberg of how

00:46:11.922 --> 00:46:13.130 align:middle line:90%
we're going to be using them.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:14.740 align:middle line:84%
If I talk to you
in five years, we

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.830 align:middle line:84%
may be having a completely
different conversation.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:17.705 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:46:17.705 --> 00:46:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And so I'm excited
because I've seen lives saved.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:24.117 align:middle line:84%
I've seen lives
dramatically changed.

00:46:24.117 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm excited because I
know the future is going

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:29.260 align:middle line:84%
to be rich in great
promise for individuals

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.520 align:middle line:90%
that had no hope before.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:34.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it sounds like
even possibly for most people,

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.940 align:middle line:84%
it might be a dominant
therapy in the future

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.280 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves to be able to take
care of our own degenerative

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.050 align:middle line:84%
issues through what's
harvested from our jiggly bits.

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:44.932 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Exactly.

00:46:44.932 --> 00:46:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's a brave new
wonderful world we live in.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And these are positives
that are happening.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.890 align:middle line:90%
So I just say educate yourself.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:57.600 align:middle line:84%
If you're an expectant
parent, inform yourself.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Get the facts so you
can make an educated

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.660 align:middle line:90%
decision when that time comes.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can make a decision,
do I want to publicly bank

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:05.700 align:middle line:90%
and give life twice?

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Or would I like
to privately bank

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.430 align:middle line:84%
my baby's cord blood as
a family medical resource

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:11.930 align:middle line:90%
to be used in the future?

00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And when all of this cord blood
collection first came out,

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.120 align:middle line:84%
they were giving
statistics of 1 in 2,200

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.610 align:middle line:84%
would ever use their own
autologous or same cell cord

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:23.340 align:middle line:90%
blood.

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Now we're seeing
more and more parents

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that have children that have
suffered an injury at birth

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.800 align:middle line:84%
or whatever to be able to use
their cord blood stem cells.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think in the
future you're going

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:39.560 align:middle line:84%
to see that
dramatically decreased.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll see
these stem cells used

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.690 align:middle line:84%
for a myriad of
different injuries

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.810 align:middle line:84%
and different
regenerative aspects.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:47.310 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:50.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Makes sense, using
the body's own intelligence

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.620 align:middle line:90%
to heal our own bodies.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: Exactly.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:52.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Love it.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: And the bottom line
is, don't throw it away.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:58.220 align:middle line:84%
We have four million births
in our nation every year.

00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Only 5% of all cord blood is
saved privately or publicly.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
The other 95% is thrown
away as medical waste.

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And the majority
of that cord blood

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.880 align:middle line:84%
could be used to save
and change lives.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.870 align:middle line:84%
So don't throw it away,
and educate yourself,

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and that's the bottom line.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:18.406 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I'm so glad
I ran into you at the airport

00:48:18.406 --> 00:48:20.240 align:middle line:84%
while we were waiting
for a four hour delay.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.364 align:middle line:90%
>>OBER: It was meant to be.

00:48:21.364 --> 00:48:23.730 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Meant to be and we
got into this conversation.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And so here you are
speaking to us about it.

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:27.689 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very, very
happy that happened.

00:48:27.689 --> 00:48:29.980 align:middle line:84%
>>OBER: Thank you so much
for giving me the opportunity

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to share this important
information with you.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.813 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And thank you, Charis.

00:48:32.813 --> 00:48:34.260 align:middle line:90%
I really appreciate it.
