00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In
my last conversation

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:10%
with Lynne McTaggart, we
spoke about her inspiration

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.340 align:middle line:10%
for starting up
a magazine called

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.251 align:middle line:10%
"What Doctors Don't Tell You."

00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:32.750 align:middle line:10%
Now we're going to get into
some of the issues, particularly

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.840 align:middle line:10%
breast cancer and the
wisdom of Angelina Jolie

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle line:10%
to have her breasts removed.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:84%
Do genetic markers mean an
increased risk of disease?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
We'll also discuss
some hidden truths

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
behind vaccines beyond
what we've already heard,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.940 align:middle line:90%
some very interesting.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:90%
This is a juicy magazine.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.820 align:middle line:84%
You really cover a
lot of issues here

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.940 align:middle line:84%
and that one is probably
the most controversial

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.860 align:middle line:90%
in I don't know how long.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:84%
Angelina Jolie
having her breasts

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.230 align:middle line:84%
removed because of the BRCA gene
showing up in one of her tests.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:90%
So let's just dive into it.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.719 align:middle line:84%
What did the doctors
not tell Angelina?

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:84%
>>LYNNE MCTAGGART:
Loads of things, Regina.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:10%
I mean, first of all, I think
it's completely fallacious

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:10%
the idea that genes
are a death sentence.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is increasingly
being demonstrated in research

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:90%
The first thing that--

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the assumption
was for that BRCA gene,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.610 align:middle line:84%
that she would have something
like an 87% risk of cancer.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And so she felt that this was an
automatic death sentence if she

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.460 align:middle line:90%
didn't do something about it.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.820 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the science,
it demonstrates that that

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely not the case.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:10%
First of all, the
overwhelming majority

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:10%
of women who get breast cancer
do not have the BRCA gene.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.676 align:middle line:84%
When they've looked at
it and they've actually

00:01:54.676 --> 00:01:57.960 align:middle line:84%
looked at and categorized
who gets breast cancer,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:90%
that's a tiny, tiny minority.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.200 align:middle line:84%
The second thing
that's an issue is

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.660 align:middle line:84%
that those people
with the BRCA gene,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.550 align:middle line:84%
when they've actually
looked at them

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and how many people
go on to get cancer,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a first
relative who has that,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
is if you have one
relative with that gene,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.190 align:middle line:90%
your chances are about 8%.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So even with four
relatives with it--

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.780 align:middle line:84%
and I think Angelina Jolie had
two who died of breast cancer--

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
you still have less than
50%, far less than 50% chance

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.080 align:middle line:90%
of getting the disease.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.380 align:middle line:84%
But then beyond all
of that, there's

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
the whole issue of
environmental factors.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And this is more and
more being demonstrated

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.690 align:middle line:84%
as a really important
element of this whole issue.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Scientists wanted to
look at who gets cancer

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.090 align:middle line:84%
in an enormous population of
women in the Women's Health

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:90%
Initiative Study.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Now in that study,
there were thousands

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.780 align:middle line:90%
of women who took part.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And the study was really to look
at the safety or not of HRT--

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.230 align:middle line:90%
hormone replacement therapy.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.680 align:middle line:84%
They started looking at that
and they stopped the study

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.520 align:middle line:84%
prematurely because so
many women got cancer

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.210 align:middle line:84%
after taking the hormone that
they realized that there was

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.900 align:middle line:90%
this cause-effect relationship.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they felt it was
unethical to continue.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.030 align:middle line:84%
Other researchers decided
that this research data

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.390 align:middle line:84%
was a gold mine to look at
breast cancer incidence.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And they looked closer
and they figured

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.600 align:middle line:84%
that among this population
who'd got breast cancer,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
they should have seen even
more with those people who

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.940 align:middle line:84%
had a greater likelihood, with
those people who had the BRCA

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:90%
gene.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.540 align:middle line:84%
When they did,
they found the gene

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
made no difference whatsoever.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that resulted
in cancer, the only risk factor

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:84%
was whether or not the
women had taken HRT.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's interesting.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:90%
I have my laptop here.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.990 align:middle line:84%
Let me just kind of pop
this up really quickly.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
There is another part of
that story with Angelina

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.630 align:middle line:90%
in what you just talked about.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to get into
the epigenetics of it,

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.255 align:middle line:84%
too, because that's
an important topic.

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And then also get
into the first comment you made,

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.630 align:middle line:84%
which is, it's not-- just
because a doctor or tests shows

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
you have cancer, it is
not a death sentence.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.950 align:middle line:90%
And so this is what happened.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of people were
suspect after this news started

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:90%
coming out about Angelina.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
The company that creates
that test that she used,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Myriad Genetics,
their stock price

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
skyrocketed, as they say in
this article, thanks to Jolie.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it went up
50% almost overnight

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.860 align:middle line:84%
with the release of the
cover of "People" magazine,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.140 align:middle line:84%
with her doing a very
canned kind of response

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.730 align:middle line:90%
to what she had done.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:10%
And then here it
goes down further,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:10%
it talks about the
implications of that.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:10%
This drove stock prices.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.430 align:middle line:10%
And it says here that
Obamacare mandates

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.120 align:middle line:10%
taxpayers pay for the BRCA
gene testing under Obamacare.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.620 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have
to pay for that.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're finding out
that that's not really

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
what's at the basis of
the cancer, why would

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.070 align:middle line:90%
we have to be paying?

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Why would the public be saddled
with those kinds of bills

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:90%
for that kind of testing?

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.016 align:middle line:84%
In addition, the
US Supreme Court--

00:05:20.016 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
that was written before
the decision came out

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.090 align:middle line:90%
two or three weeks ago--

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.424 align:middle line:84%
was going to have to make a
decision on patenting genes.

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:26.223 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:05:26.223 --> 00:05:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I was thrilled to
find that they--

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.770 align:middle line:84%
I know there were some nuances
in it that you cannot patent

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:31.820 align:middle line:90%
human genes.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.670 align:middle line:84%
So that definitely I'm sure
was quite disappointing

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%
for some people in this field.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But when you look at it like
that, what kind of larger story

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.600 align:middle line:90%
was being projected here?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
What did it do to
the masses of women

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
who went into terror over the
potential of breast cancer?

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.820 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't comment
on Jolie's motives

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:90%
because I think--

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think
she tries to use

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:90%
her celebrity for public good.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle line:84%
But what I can
say is, yeah, it's

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:90%
a money-making machine now.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.680 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are going
to make a lot more money out

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%
of this test.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is it's not necessary.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:84%
You have to go back and
look at what scientists

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.480 align:middle line:84%
are discovering now
about genes and what

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:90%
actually causes problems.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:84%
What causes cancer and
what causes illness?

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've always been
told that our genes are

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
the blueprint, the
body's blueprint,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
very deterministic.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.934 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you've got
good genes or bad genes,

00:06:35.934 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:84%
that's going to
determine whether or not

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:90%
you're ill or well.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
But you have to understand
that genes are a little bit

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:90%
like the keys on a piano.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.970 align:middle line:84%
They're sitting there
in absolute silence

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:90%
until somebody plays them.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And what plays them
is a quartet of atoms

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.090 align:middle line:90%
sitting above the gene.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And they're
exquisitely sensitive

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
to environmental
influences of every kind--

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
the air we breathe, the water
we drink, the food we eat,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.630 align:middle line:84%
the friends we have, even
the social life we have.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.360 align:middle line:84%
The sum total of how
we live our lives.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:84%
That determines whether
or not those atoms

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:84%
are going to play the
keys of that piano

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.690 align:middle line:84%
and whether those
genes get expressed.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And we see this.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.100 align:middle line:84%
All the cutting-edge
science now shows

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.730 align:middle line:84%
that instead of being
built from inside out,

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
from our DNA to our
cells to our tissues

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.950 align:middle line:84%
to our organs, et cetera,
we're built from outside in.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.280 align:middle line:84%
We're built from the
environmental influence that

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:90%
has, that affects our genes.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And scientists have seen this
with a number of studies.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.460 align:middle line:84%
Probably the most seminal
had to do with a thing called

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:90%
the agouti mice.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
The little mouse.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: The little
mouse that roared.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
A fellow called
Randy Jirtle, who

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
is an expert in genetic
factors gone awry,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.830 align:middle line:84%
was approached by one
of his graduate students

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.960 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to see whether
there were substances

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.422 align:middle line:90%
that could override bad genes.

00:08:11.422 --> 00:08:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you want to
do a study like this,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.980 align:middle line:84%
you've got to pull out
a genetic quirk of fate.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get a kind of a
genetic mistake, so to speak.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.990 align:middle line:84%
And so they chose to
work on agouti mice.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, agouti mice are
like the couch potatoes

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.610 align:middle line:90%
of the rodent community.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.530 align:middle line:84%
They have a defect
in their genes

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.690 align:middle line:84%
that renders them peach-colored,
and they're also hugely obese.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.429 align:middle line:84%
And the assumption has been
that once an agouti mouse,

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
always an agouti mouse, so
that an agouti mouse should

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.180 align:middle line:84%
automatically hand
down its aberrant

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:90%
genes to its offspring.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And they will also live short
and miserable lives, too.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So they fed pregnant agouti
mice with B vitamins,

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.310 align:middle line:84%
because the problem
with agouti mice

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.172 align:middle line:84%
is they can't process
B vitamins naturally.

00:09:04.172 --> 00:09:06.005 align:middle line:84%
So he gave them some
extra B vitamins and lo

00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and behold, out came
normal, slim, brown mice

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.110 align:middle line:90%
from their offspring.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And so what they
had done completely

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.640 align:middle line:84%
rocked the scientific community
because what they demonstrated

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.330 align:middle line:84%
is that an environmental
influence, i.e.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.504 align:middle line:90%
vitamins, can override genes.

00:09:26.504 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I thought
that was just fascinating.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And so
this is the real point

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is where all the new
research in cancer is going on.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.100 align:middle line:84%
There's some research
in Canada by a scientist

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.470 align:middle line:84%
called Moshe Schiff,
who was looking

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.140 align:middle line:90%
at these epigenetic factors--

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and that's that little
quartet of atoms

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:90%
sitting above the gene--

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and how those environmental
influences are the trigger.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And what you need is
not just bad genes,

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
you need an
environmental trigger.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can
become relatively esoteric

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.130 align:middle line:84%
in the discussion here, too,
because of the effect of mind,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.010 align:middle line:84%
spirit, emotions,
as you say, even

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.430 align:middle line:84%
the people that you
spend your time with.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.570 align:middle line:84%
And this, I remember in
reading Bruce's first book,

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.430 align:middle line:84%
"Biology of Belief," this
one just stuck in my head.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:84%
This one example he
gave was of a young boy

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.210 align:middle line:84%
who had developed a thicker
skull than the lineage

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
of the rest of his family.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But it went back
and it was looking

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
at the factors involved,
which was a lot of brutality

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.760 align:middle line:90%
of the mother in utero.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And he's saying in that
kind of instance, the body,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.240 align:middle line:84%
the spirit, whoever drives--
the intelligence that

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:84%
drives the mechanism
of development,

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
thickened up the skull because
that being knew that there

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
would be essentially
potential danger

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
against his own being, potential
violence against his own being,

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.500 align:middle line:90%
as an adaptation.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.900 align:middle line:84%
Which I just
thought was amazing.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.802 align:middle line:84%
Now, none of this
is a surprise to you

00:10:59.802 --> 00:11:02.010 align:middle line:84%
because you've spent so many
years with the Intention

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.881 align:middle line:90%
Experiment.

00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, this is it.

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the whole idea that
we're just inextricably linked

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
between physicality
and mind and spirit.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.804 align:middle line:84%
And all of these factors are
going to play in our genes

00:11:15.804 --> 00:11:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
factors are going

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.200 align:middle line:84%
to determine what gets
produced, what gets expressed.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.770 align:middle line:90%
And we see this as--

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.790 align:middle line:84%
a doctor who writes for
"What Doctors Don't Tell You"

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:84%
talked about one
of his patients who

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.960 align:middle line:90%
came to him with the bad gene.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And she said, all
of my relatives,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.580 align:middle line:84%
all my female relatives
have had cancer.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And they're all
telling me to have

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.440 align:middle line:84%
a just-in-case mastectomy,
double mastectomy.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:90%
What should I do?

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well, let's look at
these possible triggers first.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.969 align:middle line:84%
And he explained the whole
epigenetic thing to her.

00:11:50.969 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And then he tested her
and found she was allergic

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.880 align:middle line:90%
to milk and a few other things.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And he gave her certain
nutrients and vitamins,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.570 align:middle line:84%
Of all of her female
relatives, she

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
was the only one who
didn't get cancer.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Didn't go ahead and
have that operation.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And 30 years later
he contacted her,

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
and she's still alive and
well and hasn't had cancer.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.560 align:middle line:90%
So it's all about that trigger.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.780 align:middle line:84%
So the idea that we have this
automatic blueprint and death

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.234 align:middle line:90%
sentence is completely wrong.

00:12:20.234 --> 00:12:21.900 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what
you were just saying,

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.660 align:middle line:84%
she trusted that
there were other means

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:90%
of dealing with her health.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, how much of, quote,
this "genetic" kind of

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.039 align:middle line:84%
knocked on effect
through the genes--

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.080 align:middle line:90%
or not through the genes.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.020 align:middle line:84%
It actually is not
through the genes.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.750 align:middle line:84%
You have an experience
in a family, your mother

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and your aunt die of
breast cancer, for example.

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And so now you're
frightened of breast cancer.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Now you and your sister are
frightened of breast cancer.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Now you have
children and they're

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.500 align:middle line:90%
frightened of breast cancer.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.350 align:middle line:84%
The mere fact of going
into this fear process

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:84%
over this very targeted
area of the body

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.610 align:middle line:84%
would in effect
create what looks

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.350 align:middle line:84%
like a genetic passed-on
effect, would it not?

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.674 align:middle line:84%
Because the mind can create
the very circumstance.

00:13:01.674 --> 00:13:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART:
Interestingly enough,

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
that happened to
a friend of mine.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Her mother died early of
ovarian cancer, just like Jolie,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.010 align:middle line:90%
and she was terrified.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.680 align:middle line:90%
So she got her ovaries removed.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And then she was also
worried about breast cancer.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And so she got her
breasts removed, too.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:90%
And she felt, OK, I'm safe now.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to get cancer.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:23.130 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.650 align:middle line:84%
She was-- and her daughter was
told she ought to-- as soon

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.130 align:middle line:84%
as she's had her kids, she
ought to get the whole stuff--

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.760 align:middle line:90%
all that stuff out, too.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:90%
And she got cancer anyway.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.270 align:middle line:90%
She still got cancer.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said it was
statistically impossible

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:90%
and she still got cancer.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.736 align:middle line:84%
But I'll address that later
as to possibly why, too.

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you
address it now?

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:90%
We're on it.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:46.140 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well,
the real issue

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.480 align:middle line:84%
is, what's the risk
factor when you

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.910 align:middle line:90%
go through all that operation?

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:54.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, Jolie has had
reconstructive surgery.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.200 align:middle line:84%
My friend had
reconstructive surgery.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
They put silicone implants in
with reconstructive surgery.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's now studies
showing that people

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
who get silicone implants have
an increased chance of getting

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
a certain kind of
lymphoma, which

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:90%
is exactly what my friend got.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.420 align:middle line:84%
And that chance is at
least 20%, I believe.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a big increased risk.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing, too, is women

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.600 align:middle line:84%
who have their
ovaries taken out will

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
go through an immediate
sudden menopause.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So they will almost
guarantee to be put on HRT.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:90%
I remember I talked before.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
There is as much as
a 60% chance you're

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:90%
going to get cancer from HRT.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.890 align:middle line:84%
So added up together,
suddenly you've

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.860 align:middle line:84%
got this big increased
risk of breast cancer

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.440 align:middle line:84%
after doing the very thing
that's been suggested to you

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.920 align:middle line:90%
will avoid it.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.829 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's
possibly exactly what

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:52.745 align:middle line:90%
happened to my friend.

00:14:52.745 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.280 align:middle line:84%
What about the-- you deal
with a lot of doctors.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.980 align:middle line:84%
You have doctors on your
panel for this magazine.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.860 align:middle line:84%
When they're speaking about
it from their own perspective

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.540 align:middle line:84%
regarding chemo
and [INAUDIBLE]----

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
you have an article in,
I've forgotten which

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:84%
month's edition, that chemo
actually will help propagate

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:90%
cancer in the body.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.140 align:middle line:90%
They have to know this.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:17.490 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Doctors
realize that cancer--

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.262 align:middle line:84%
that chemo and radiation
don't work very well.

00:15:21.262 --> 00:15:22.220 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they know this.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
The problem is these are
the only tools they have.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:26.580 align:middle line:90%
That's the first problem.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.180 align:middle line:90%
The second thing is they don't--

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.040 align:middle line:84%
they read the medical
literature, which

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.890 align:middle line:90%
talks about response times.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.140 align:middle line:84%
With cancer, there's
a lot of lies,

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.230 align:middle line:90%
and damn statistics that go on.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And one of those is
talking about relative risk

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:90%
or relative benefit.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.560 align:middle line:84%
When they write this in
studies, they'll say,

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.530 align:middle line:84%
this chemotherapy
had a success rate,

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.745 align:middle line:90%
relative success rate of 50%.

00:15:53.745 --> 00:15:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, that's
a garbage bucket word.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:55.980 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Right.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.792 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:15:56.792 --> 00:15:58.050 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What's that mean?

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: What it means
is, let's say it had--

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:04.790 align:middle line:84%
there was a success
rate before of 2%.

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:10.430 align:middle line:84%
And if chemo raised it to 4%,
they'll call it a 50% success

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:90%
rate, you know?

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's that kind of thing.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
When they've actually looked
at chemo and looked it all--

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.470 align:middle line:84%
we did a study on this recently,
or a story on this recently.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.080 align:middle line:84%
When they did a study and
really stripped out all

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.380 align:middle line:84%
the hype and everything, they
found chemo works something

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.950 align:middle line:90%
like 2% to 4% of the time.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: 2%
to 4% of the time.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.600 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That is it.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.016 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And
otherwise what it

00:16:35.016 --> 00:16:39.080 align:middle line:84%
will do, Regina, is just
a short response time.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
cancer will recede.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.050 align:middle line:84%
But we all have to remember
what's going on instead

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
is a huge effect, a huge
damage to the immune system.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we were
talking to that story

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:90%
you were mentioning.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.440 align:middle line:84%
What happens is all of the
healthy cells around a prostate

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
cancer is a story
of prostate cancers.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:84%
All of the healthy cells
around the prostate cancer cell

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:84%
are killed, so that enables the
prostate cancer cell to have

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:08.420 align:middle line:90%
much more of a free ride.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know that a lot of
these doctors do know that.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of the doctors
you're working with clearly

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:90%
know that.

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And the magazine features
articles on alternative

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:84%
means to deal with
a lot of these.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And I know-- there's one man
here in the United States

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.710 align:middle line:90%
called Dr. James Forsythe.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.530 align:middle line:84%
There are many, but he
in particular-- nothing

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.780 align:middle line:90%
but problems with the AMA.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they've come after
him for every minor infraction

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.230 align:middle line:84%
that they could possibly
try to trump up.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.730 align:middle line:84%
The reality is he was one of the
first oncologists in California

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.820 align:middle line:84%
in that new budding
field 40 years ago.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.965 align:middle line:84%
And was in it for quite a long
time and saw the same thing.

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.759 align:middle line:90%
2% to 4%.

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, you can't
talk about a cure

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
if you're only living
another three years.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.090 align:middle line:90%
That's not a cure.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.664 align:middle line:84%
And he started
working through many

00:17:55.664 --> 00:17:57.330 align:middle line:84%
of the things I think
your magazine also

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.670 align:middle line:84%
features, through diet,
attitude, supplementation,

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:90%
certainly.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And he's been able-- they're now
doing clinical testing on it.

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.300 align:middle line:84%
He's been able to get
that number up to 45%.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:84%
They're only, I think,
three years in or so.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
They're expecting that number
to rise to as much as 70%

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:90%
as time goes on.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that sounds in
reverse, but the way

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:90%
he was explaining it--

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:28.547 align:middle line:84%
the test isn't
complete at this point.

00:18:28.547 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
But they're expecting--
maybe it's reversed.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's 70% now
and they expect 45%

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:90%
at least after five years.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And he only takes
the toughest cases,

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
the ones who have
given up, some of whom

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.420 align:middle line:84%
have already had chemotherapy
and had to totally rebuild

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.930 align:middle line:90%
the immune system.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, you know another
doctor like that

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.892 align:middle line:84%
who has helped people,
thousands of people

00:18:46.892 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that you're aware of,
in England as well.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Dr. Patrick
Kingsley, who is now retired,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:57.790 align:middle line:84%
who also has had some hassles
from authorities over time.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.160 align:middle line:84%
But for years lived in a
country village and the world

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
came to him.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
And he specialized in two
no-hoper conditions, which is

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.230 align:middle line:90%
multiple sclerosis and cancer.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:11.204 align:middle line:84%
You also got people
who'd come to him

00:19:11.204 --> 00:19:13.370 align:middle line:84%
who were sicker than anyone
else because they'd been

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.140 align:middle line:90%
through all of everything else.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And when everyone else gave
up hope, they'd go to him.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was changing
case after case.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:84%
He didn't lose
that many patients,

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:90%
including my mother-in-law.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:84%
My mother-in-law
went to him after--

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
my mother-in-law was British,
and typical of that generation

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:90%
of Britain, she was very stoic.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And she had some bleeding from
her breast and kept this quiet

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.440 align:middle line:84%
and just nursed it herself
until it got too bad.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
When she finally went to her
general practitioner who said,

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.990 align:middle line:84%
you know, I think you've got
cancer, but it's too late.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
There's too late
for chemo, it's too

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.340 align:middle line:90%
late for radiation, et cetera.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank God.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Thank God.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.160 align:middle line:90%
It was too late for surgery.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And he told us, she's got
about three months to live.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:90%
I'd get her papers in order.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So we decided not to give up
and we brought her to Patrick.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:84%
And I was in the room with her
to give her some Dutch courage

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.654 align:middle line:90%
when he examined her.

00:20:17.654 --> 00:20:19.070 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
her breast, which

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.980 align:middle line:90%
must have been like raw meat.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
It was just-- and the other
doctor had recoiled at this.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at it and he
just said-- and I heard him--

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.500 align:middle line:90%
oh, we can handle that.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.292 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
at that moment--

00:20:31.292 --> 00:20:32.125 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Just that.

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:32.610 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: At that moment.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's where
the healing begins.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: That's
where the healing began.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:90%
That optimism.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.080 align:middle line:84%
What he did was he gave her very
high-dose intravenous vitamin

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:84%
C, plus some other
high-dose nutrients.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:84%
He also gave her intravenous
hydrogen peroxide,

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:90%
which is H-2-O-2.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when that's
injected into the body,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:58.210 align:middle line:84%
it turns into water and an
extra molecule of oxygen.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that's so important

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.740 align:middle line:90%
is cancer is anaerobic.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
It can't live in oxygen. So
the oxygen zaps the cancer.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.040 align:middle line:90%
So he gave her that.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.470 align:middle line:90%
He changed her diet slightly.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:84%
No severe diet
juicing, et cetera.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.900 align:middle line:84%
All he did was take out
dairy and a few other things

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.630 align:middle line:84%
that he felt were inflammatory
that she was allergic to,

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
gave her some
supplements to take,

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.560 align:middle line:84%
and it completely
reversed her cancer.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.192 align:middle line:90%
She was 79 at the time.

00:21:26.192 --> 00:21:27.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Isn't that amazing?

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.200 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.320 align:middle line:84%
And she lived another
number of years.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.100 align:middle line:90%
So it was incredible.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Her doctor was speechless
when he examined her

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.550 align:middle line:84%
some months later and saw her
breast had completely healed.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I bet
he was speechless.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Did he-- what did he
say when she told him

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.366 align:middle line:90%
how that had been accomplished?

00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: He was very
open-minded about it

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and he was really
interested in it.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.770 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's outside of
the paradigm they understand.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: But he
was very good about it.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.431 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are many
doctors out there

00:21:57.431 --> 00:22:01.270 align:middle line:84%
who are very open-minded
and willing to say, OK,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.450 align:middle line:84%
that's not what I learned,
but I'm willing to see.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm willing to be proved wrong.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what do you think
about the whole pink ribbon

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:90%
campaign?

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, I think there
is the whole thing of Cancer,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
Inc. in this
country, in America.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.030 align:middle line:84%
There is a lot of
money behind cancer.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
suppression and prosecution

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.650 align:middle line:84%
of very promising
therapies in cancer.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's scandalous.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of it is
all about money.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:84%
All about money, because
there's the drugs,

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.320 align:middle line:90%
there's the radiation equipment.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It's all big, big business.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
scandalous because people

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:84%
need to be told that this stuff
really doesn't work very well.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And when it does work, it
works because people really

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:90%
believe it's going to work.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:59.530 align:middle line:90%
I agree with you.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And I have friends
who've had breast cancer

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
and been through the whole
gamut of treatments and just--

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
it was the most miserable
period of their lives,

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and they managed
to get through it.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
But to put pink
ribbons out there as

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.310 align:middle line:84%
though it's a social club, as
though you should expect this,

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.962 align:middle line:84%
one in three of you
should expect this now.

00:23:20.962 --> 00:23:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a bit of
predictive programming there,

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.010 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.176 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, it is,
and I think what we really

00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:84%
have to look at is, if
it's one in three of us,

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:84%
what are we doing wrong
in our lives that's

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:90%
causing this cancer?

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.380 align:middle line:84%
What environmental factor
is having a big issue?

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And I tell you what it
is without a doubt--

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.030 align:middle line:90%
hormones.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, a majority of women
are on some kind of hormone.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.520 align:middle line:84%
They've taken the pill
or they've taken HRT,

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and there's very compelling
data demonstrating,

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:52.510 align:middle line:84%
like that Women's
Health Initiative,

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.460 align:middle line:90%
that this stuff causes cancer.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many
other elements, too,

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:90%
that we really have to look at.

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:84%
So rather than, let's cure
it through these heroic

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and dangerous and
damaging means,

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.100 align:middle line:84%
let's look at why we have so
much cancer, and prevent it.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.199 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:24:10.199 --> 00:24:11.740 align:middle line:84%
While I'm on that
note, I was talking

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.969 align:middle line:90%
about Dr. James Forsythe.

00:24:12.969 --> 00:24:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that wants to,
that's in the Gaia Archive,

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and then they can get
the stats straight

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:18.059 align:middle line:90%
because I can't remember them.

00:24:18.059 --> 00:24:20.540 align:middle line:84%
But the story's good
and it very much

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.300 align:middle line:90%
aligns with what you're saying.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:90%
What about mammograms?

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.472 align:middle line:90%
That's a huge one.

00:24:25.472 --> 00:24:26.930 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: That's
a huge one too,

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.657 align:middle line:84%
because women are told,
well, because we're all

00:24:29.657 --> 00:24:31.240 align:middle line:84%
going to have breast
cancer, so you've

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.760 align:middle line:84%
got to have an annual
or semiannual mammogram.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And once again,
there's no question--

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.330 align:middle line:84%
no question, Regina-- the
absolute evidence is there.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Mammograms cause cancer.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.320 align:middle line:84%
They increase the possibility
you're going to get cancer.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And if you're getting
them all the time,

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
you're just
increasing your risk,

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.690 align:middle line:84%
because X-rays are
cumulative in the body.

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that's
a dangerous mechanism.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to look
at are better alternatives.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And these days, there's
a fantastic alternative

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
in thermography.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Thermography looks
at-- cancer cells

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.900 align:middle line:84%
give off more heat
than regular cells.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.190 align:middle line:84%
And they find this very,
very early on, at a point

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:21.120 align:middle line:90%
where it's so easy to treat it.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.830 align:middle line:84%
And the other problem
with mammograms

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.340 align:middle line:90%
is that they create--

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.950 align:middle line:84%
they find-- they're
like, indiscriminate.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.260 align:middle line:84%
They'll find any
problem, any anomaly

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.100 align:middle line:84%
in the breast, any unusual
lump or tumor of density

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:90%
becomes a cancer.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And so the problem is massive,
massive overtreatment.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.240 align:middle line:84%
One of the examples of that is
a thing called ductal carcinoma

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:84%
in situ, which is a cancer
that nine out of 10 cases

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.590 align:middle line:90%
does not progress to cancer.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
But because it's picked
up, most people--

00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:02.080 align:middle line:84%
ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS,
in the vast majority of cases

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.160 align:middle line:90%
just burns itself out.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.310 align:middle line:84%
It's just some sort of
anomaly at some point.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
It's some sort of weird
mass that just runs a course

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:90%
and burns itself out.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:15.280 align:middle line:84%
And they find this with
women who don't treat it.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.750 align:middle line:84%
But women now all
get treated for that.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.870 align:middle line:84%
They get treated as
though that is cancer.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:20.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So they do chemo,
radiation, those things on it?

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: The
whole thing on--

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:22.780 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, geez.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: --something that--

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.535 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's not even cancer.

00:26:24.535 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: --doesn't spread.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.050 align:middle line:90%
That isn't even cancer.

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:30.640 align:middle line:84%
It's just a pre-cancer, as
they call it, which is--

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.920 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing
as pre-sex and there's

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.140 align:middle line:90%
no such thing as pre-cancer.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:34.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.380 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: You to do it
or you don't, you know?

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:43.810 align:middle line:84%
But thermography is fabulous,
because it picks up--

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.430 align:middle line:90%
it's much more accurate.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.643 align:middle line:90%
It picks up things that are--

00:26:47.643 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes it will demonstrate
that something isn't cancer

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:90%
when a mammogram has said it is.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's also not
invasive in any way.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.260 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't hurt the body.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Another one for a really
experienced practitioner

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:90%
is ultrasound.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.500 align:middle line:84%
It's slightly less accurate,
but it is, in experienced hands,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.435 align:middle line:84%
it's highly accurate
and highly specific.

00:27:07.435 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The main point
of this conversation

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.310 align:middle line:84%
for me is that, what you said
toward the beginning, which is,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.840 align:middle line:90%
cancer is not a death sentence.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.660 align:middle line:84%
We all have cancer
cells in our body.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Some of us will express
it in one way or another.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
But there are relatively
inexpensive ways

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.162 align:middle line:90%
to go about reversing it.

00:27:24.162 --> 00:27:26.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean from broccoli-- and you
have one little article here

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.630 align:middle line:84%
on broccoli and breast cancer,
including aggressive breast

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.430 align:middle line:90%
cancers.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.860 align:middle line:84%
But all the way to
far-infrared light.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there are
many, many ways

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.192 align:middle line:90%
to go about reversing this.

00:27:36.192 --> 00:27:37.400 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes, absolutely.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: The fear is what
really drives it in, it feels.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.518 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: The
fear drives it in.

00:27:41.518 --> 00:27:44.690 align:middle line:84%
And people must understand that
cancer isn't an automatic death

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.490 align:middle line:90%
sentence.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.290 align:middle line:90%
Cancer is a process.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:52.030 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is something in your life
that is really out of kilter

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:53.770 align:middle line:90%
that you have to address.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the most dangerous things
that doctors say to patients

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is, live your life as
you've always lived it.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, the way you've
always lived it

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.330 align:middle line:84%
is what has given
you the cancer.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:04.130 align:middle line:90%
Whether that is--

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.570 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Whether that is
the toxins in your toiletries,

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.820 align:middle line:84%
whether that is your
bad diet, whether that

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.220 align:middle line:84%
is huge deficiencies,
whether that

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.210 align:middle line:84%
is an emotional-- if you're
in an emotional cul-de-sac,

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:20.320 align:middle line:84%
or you feel like a trapped
rat in your relationship

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.060 align:middle line:90%
or your workplace.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:26.548 align:middle line:84%
Those are all
cancer-causing situations.

00:28:26.548 --> 00:28:30.970 align:middle line:84%
People oftentimes get
cancer when they either have

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.050 align:middle line:90%
a trauma, some big trauma--

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Very common.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: --or
they've lost the ability

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:42.130 align:middle line:84%
to foresee that life will
ever be joyful again.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And so those sorts of things
are all cancer-causing.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.020 align:middle line:84%
So the last thing you
want to do is live life

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.730 align:middle line:90%
as you've always lived it.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:84%
But what it is, is
a huge wake-up call

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:54.340 align:middle line:84%
to say, what am I doing wrong
and what do I have to fix?

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:58.870 align:middle line:84%
And through that
big life review,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:84%
you have a good chance
of getting better

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.500 align:middle line:90%
with any kind of cancer.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.900 align:middle line:84%
But it means really changing
the way you live your life.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, and
still a lot of people

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
do prefer a magic
bullet, if they

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.800 align:middle line:84%
think that the chemo or
radiation or the surgery

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.210 align:middle line:90%
is the magic bullet.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:17.590 align:middle line:84%
But that's something
we're having

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to look at across the board,
is self-responsibility.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.250 align:middle line:84%
We've been conditioned
to give that power away.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I can't tell you how many people
I've talked my talk to who

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.350 align:middle line:84%
have-- friends of
mine, or friends,

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.510 align:middle line:90%
or people I know with cancer--

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:35.170 align:middle line:84%
who I've said, well, please
talk to these people who

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.630 align:middle line:84%
will give you a protocol
of different things to do

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:90%
and different things to look at.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And if you clean up the
toxins in your environment

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and you clean up your diet
and you take supplements

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.370 align:middle line:84%
and you look at your
spiritual and emotional life,

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.080 align:middle line:84%
you have a good chance
of beating this.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.240 align:middle line:90%
And they say--

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Too much work.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.156 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: --I think
I'd rather just-- yeah.

00:29:54.156 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd rather
just take the drug.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.552 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
mentality, as you say.

00:29:58.552 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: We've been raised--

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: It's
the magic pill.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We've been
raised to do that.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:90%
The magic pill for every ill.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And we really need
to look at that one,

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.810 align:middle line:84%
because the magic pill comes
with its own set of side

00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:11.950 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:13.510 align:middle line:90%
Very dangerous.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And the magic pill in the
main doesn't work very well.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: True.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, another subject we want
to talk about is vaccines.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And we'll talk about it from
a couple of different angles

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:24.670 align:middle line:90%
than--

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.830 align:middle line:84%
normally we talk about
babies and vaccines,

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get to that.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's summer travel
season right now,

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.210 align:middle line:84%
as we're shooting this,
and a lot of people,

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:36.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to an
exotic region of the world,

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.070 align:middle line:84%
they tell you you must have this
shot, you must have that shot.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.314 align:middle line:84%
And shoot, when
I was 20, I think

00:30:41.314 --> 00:30:42.730 align:middle line:84%
I had all of them
when I was going

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:90%
to exotic parts of the world.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what's
required versus what's not.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
really good article

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.160 align:middle line:90%
in your magazine on that.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.530 align:middle line:10%
>>MCTAGGART: Well,
vaccines are often

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:59.890 align:middle line:10%
the place where doctors
and the medical profession

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:10%
have lost all reason
about illness and risk.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And travel vaccines
take that even further.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that on the British
website-- where I live--

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.330 align:middle line:84%
on the British National
Health Service website,

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.420 align:middle line:84%
they talk about danger
zones and where you need

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:90%
to have a load of vaccines.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.650 align:middle line:90%
And included in there is the US.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.160 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You have to have
vaccines to come over-- whoa,

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:26.485 align:middle line:90%
interesting.

00:31:26.485 --> 00:31:26.910 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: And Portugal.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What kind?

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.900 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: I know, we were
two highly developed countries

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.750 align:middle line:90%
the last time I looked.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's that kind of
just-in-case mentality

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:84%
that assumes that you can do
all of this with impunity.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And here's the problem
with travel vaccines.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And these are vaccines for
cholera, typhoid, mal--

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.580 align:middle line:90%
malaria doesn't have a vaccine.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.090 align:middle line:84%
You take a drug to treat
malaria as a just-in-case thing.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.095 align:middle line:84%
And they hope that
will act as a vaccine,

00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:55.390 align:middle line:84%
because they don't have
an effective vaccine yet.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And there's things like
Japanese encephalitis

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and tick-borne encephalitis,
and all sorts of stuff.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.530 align:middle line:90%
Hepatitis A and B--

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:04.310 align:middle line:90%
all these kinds of things.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the big problem
is, in the main,

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
these travel vaccines
don't work very well.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:middle line:84%
Typhoid, cholera, they have
really bad success rates.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:20.960 align:middle line:90%
And some of the others--

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.600 align:middle line:90%
well, just about all of them--

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.805 align:middle line:84%
also come with a
coterie of side effects.

00:32:24.805 --> 00:32:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
Some of them cause paralysis,
some of them cause death,

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:84%
some of them cause all
kinds of travel sickness.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, taking
malaria, the number

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.550 align:middle line:84%
of people who take the malaria
combination pills now and are

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.880 align:middle line:84%
sick for their entire
holiday is just huge.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.200 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is, so
they don't work very well

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.210 align:middle line:90%
in the main.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Many of them wear off quickly.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.180 align:middle line:84%
They come with a huge
number of side effects.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And for many of them,
they're not really necessary.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:04.240 align:middle line:84%
When you actually look at the
statistics of the number-- you

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.615 align:middle line:84%
know, the likelihood
you're going

00:33:05.615 --> 00:33:11.050 align:middle line:84%
to get one of these illnesses,
they're extremely low.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So here's the problem with
vaccines of all sorts.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.100 align:middle line:84%
It's always a
risk-benefit equation.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.970 align:middle line:84%
There's so much that is
buried about vaccines

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that the general
public almost never get

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:26.050 align:middle line:84%
to hear about side
effects unless they

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:90%
do their own research.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.490 align:middle line:84%
But every single
vaccine, travel vaccines

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:36.130 align:middle line:84%
included, come with a huge range
of side effects and as I say,

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.690 align:middle line:90%
work imperfectly.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not that they
don't work at all.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It's that they're
work imperfectly.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:47.062 align:middle line:84%
After all, they are an
immunological trick.

00:33:47.062 --> 00:33:48.520 align:middle line:84%
They're basically
tricking the body

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.230 align:middle line:84%
into thinking it's
got the disease,

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:53.800 align:middle line:84%
so it mounts an
immune system defense.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.074 align:middle line:84%
So that when it hits
the disease, the idea--

00:33:56.074 --> 00:33:58.490 align:middle line:84%
you know, when it actually is
confronted with the disease,

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.323 align:middle line:84%
the idea is that the
immune system will then

00:34:00.323 --> 00:34:05.950 align:middle line:84%
have a bulletproof vest on and
be able to defend you from it.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.112 align:middle line:90%
But that doesn't always work.

00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't always work.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is,
too, introducing

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:15.070 align:middle line:84%
all of these foreign proteins,
introducing all of these--

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:18.159 align:middle line:84%
some of these nasty chemicals--
a lot of them have formaldehyde

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.840 align:middle line:90%
in them, for instance--

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.840 align:middle line:84%
cause damage,
Caused real damage.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.840 align:middle line:84%
And as I say, in many cases
they're not necessary.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.590 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do is follow
some basic rules of hygiene

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:90%
when you're traveling.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So I always say that the
questions anybody looking

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:40.810 align:middle line:84%
at any kind of vaccine, whether
for children or for travel,

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:43.780 align:middle line:90%
needs to ask is these three.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.190 align:middle line:90%
How necessary is this?

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.639 align:middle line:90%
How effective is this vaccine?

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And how safe is this vaccine?

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Because that's always going
to be your weighing-off thing.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you find, oh,
well, actually only

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.520 align:middle line:84%
20 people in the entire world
got cholera last year who

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:04.030 align:middle line:84%
are travelers, but the side
effects of this vaccine

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:84%
include dismemberment and death,
they include severe damage,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.050 align:middle line:84%
well, then that risk-benefit
equation just doesn't stack up.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.020 align:middle line:90%
So one should avoid it.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think our whole purpose is
not telling people what to do.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Our entire purpose
with this magazine

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is to give people the facts
they don't get anywhere else

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.630 align:middle line:84%
and let them make an informed
decision to take control

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.500 align:middle line:90%
of their own health.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.580 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.842 align:middle line:84%
On that same note, you
were talking about malaria,

00:35:34.842 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
they haven't created
a vaccine yet.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
work of Jim Humble.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And Jim Humble
with his MMS, which

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.260 align:middle line:90%
is a type of sodium chloride.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.380 align:middle line:84%
He initially discovered
its properties

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because he was mining in
Africa and the people that

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.520 align:middle line:90%
were with him--

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.430 align:middle line:84%
that is how the
story goes, right?

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.530 align:middle line:84%
He had some people that were
with him who developed malaria

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and he had actually only brought
that simple, cheap, cheap

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.390 align:middle line:90%
substance along to purify water.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And out of desperation-- they
weren't close to anything--

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.010 align:middle line:84%
he started giving it
to the helpers, right?

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, the malaria
reversed itself.

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But now, since then, tens if not
hundreds of thousands of people

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.420 align:middle line:84%
have used MMS for curing
these dastardly diseases

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.540 align:middle line:84%
in situations, even working
with it with cancer,

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and it costs maybe,
what, $12 for a bottle

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.760 align:middle line:90%
to run the whole course.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean there are these
things out there like MMS.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.710 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's one lone tried
and tested herbal remedy called

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.480 align:middle line:90%
Artemisia annua--

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.600 align:middle line:90%
wormwood.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And wormwood has been used
in traditional cultures

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.360 align:middle line:84%
for many, many years
to treat malaria.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And they found--
and they've done

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.710 align:middle line:84%
studies on this in the
medical literature--

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that it not only
treats, it prevents.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It's a preventative as well.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course the drug
companies got on to this

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and they decided, right, let's
take the active ingredient out

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:90%
of this.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.390 align:middle line:84%
It's artemisinin, or
something like that.

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And add other drugs to it.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So they've got ACT drugs,
which are drugs that have

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.260 align:middle line:90%
this active ingredient in it.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.850 align:middle line:90%
And guess what's happening?

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.180 align:middle line:84%
As is the case with
just about every drug,

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the malaria bug is developing
a resistance to it.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:30.180 align:middle line:84%
So we suggest people go back
to the original herb that's

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:34.800 align:middle line:84%
got all of the other
factors in there.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.440 align:middle line:84%
You're less likely to
encounter resistance.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.390 align:middle line:90%
There is another one-- tetanus.

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:43.540 align:middle line:90%
A lot of times people--

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Johan Boswinkel,
the biophoton man,

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.650 align:middle line:84%
said tetanus actually is
devastating to the body

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.780 align:middle line:84%
because it switches
off the body's ability

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.670 align:middle line:84%
to discern when something
really is out of whack or out

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:90%
of balance.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:58.079 align:middle line:84%
It can't tell anymore, so it
doesn't mount any response.

00:37:58.079 --> 00:37:59.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: I have heard that.

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that tetanus
is really damaging

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.810 align:middle line:90%
to the immune system.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:07.650 align:middle line:84%
One has to remember, you are
injecting yourself with lived

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.100 align:middle line:90%
or killed toxins or bugs.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.250 align:middle line:90%
You know, viruses or bacteria.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In that unstable
medium of eggs and things

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:17.460 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And
also foreign DNA.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
particularly devastating

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:27.600 align:middle line:84%
to a very young immune
system, like a newborn baby.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So it's again, it's a situation
where the medical profession

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:90%
has lost all reason.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.330 align:middle line:90%
And it's well-intended.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the idea that they
are trying to prevent illness

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.860 align:middle line:90%
is well-intended.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And they feel that this
is the safest and the best

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.700 align:middle line:90%
way of doing it.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But they just-- you
know, the path to hell

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.832 align:middle line:90%
was paved with good intentions.

00:38:50.832 --> 00:38:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what's going on,

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.720 align:middle line:84%
because there's untold damage
that these vaccines have

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:90%
caused.

00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about the basic
ones like measles, for example?

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.170 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, measles is
really interesting, because--

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:05.850 align:middle line:84%
we've done a number
of stories recently

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:07.224 align:middle line:84%
in "What Doctors
Don't Tell You."

00:39:07.224 --> 00:39:12.300 align:middle line:84%
Because measles--
Dr. Andrew Wakefield,

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.860 align:middle line:84%
the gastroenterologist
in the UK,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.910 align:middle line:84%
had a load of pediatric
patients, young children,

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:25.170 align:middle line:84%
who came to him with terrible
gut problems and also autism.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And the common link
between all of them

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.030 align:middle line:84%
was recently being vaccinated
with the measles, mumps,

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.460 align:middle line:90%
rubella vaccine.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, Andrew Wakefield published
his material in "The Lancet."

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And he published
a follow-up study

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.890 align:middle line:90%
and he continued studying that.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.872 align:middle line:90%
He was totally demonized.

00:39:42.872 --> 00:39:43.705 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Crucified.

00:39:43.705 --> 00:39:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: He was
crucified in the UK.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
They stripped him of
his medical license,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:53.040 align:middle line:84%
they trumped up some
sort of stupid charge.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And now the press now has
decided that they were culpable

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.580 align:middle line:84%
because they talked about
the dangers of the vaccine,

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:05.692 align:middle line:84%
and the take-up rate
of MMR fell down.

00:40:05.692 --> 00:40:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And there have been a
few outbreaks of measles,

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.230 align:middle line:84%
and they've blamed it on
the take-up rate going down.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.930 align:middle line:84%
What they haven't
said, what the doctors

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:17.850 align:middle line:84%
don't tell you is that a great
number of those children who

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:20.480 align:middle line:84%
developed measles
had been vaccinated.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.280 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.620 align:middle line:90%
Again.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.240 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: So the vaccine
doesn't necessarily work.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.570 align:middle line:84%
There have been many
outbreaks of measles

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and they have been
among populations

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:33.170 align:middle line:90%
where 98% were vaccinated.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:84%
That happened in Corpus
Christi in Texas.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.590 align:middle line:90%
The children were vaccinated.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.280 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the vaccines
work far less well.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we get "success
rates" on the vaccines,

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.090 align:middle line:84%
what they're testing
is antibody levels.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.400 align:middle line:84%
They test-- they
give kids a vaccine

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.250 align:middle line:84%
and then they test
how well their bodies

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:90%
have produced antibodies.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are many
cases where somebody

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.340 align:middle line:84%
who has full coterie
of antibodies

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.260 align:middle line:90%
still develops the disease.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.420 align:middle line:84%
So looking at
antibody response is

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.450 align:middle line:84%
no guarantee the vaccine
is going to work for you.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line with measles
is, the new measles epidemics

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.480 align:middle line:84%
came back, none of the press
would comment at all about it,

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.170 align:middle line:84%
but the autism statistics
do not go away.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.590 align:middle line:84%
The connection between
measles vaccine--

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:29.290 align:middle line:84%
the MMR vaccine and autism and
gut problems doesn't go away.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And they found that something
in that vaccine damages the gut

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.790 align:middle line:84%
and causes these larger
molecules to pass through

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:43.140 align:middle line:84%
from certain foods, particularly
foods dairy and wheat,

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.490 align:middle line:84%
pass through and hit the
brain and cause a problem.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So there still seems
to be a tie-in there.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:55.480 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be a huge tie
between so much foreign DNA

00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:00.280 align:middle line:84%
from all of these vaccines
and damage, vaccine damage.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And the damage doesn't go away.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.250 align:middle line:90%
There's been so much.

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:07.210 align:middle line:84%
Recently we did a story about
Gardasil, the cervical cancer

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.430 align:middle line:84%
vaccine, and it
was heartbreaking.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Perfectly healthy teenagers and
young adults get this vaccine

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and are dead a week, two
weeks, three weeks later.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's always blamed
on a coincidence.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:90%
But nobody's looking further.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's joining the dots.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And I find that totally
and utterly irresponsible.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:33.000 align:middle line:84%
You've studied this
for quite a long time.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.370 align:middle line:84%
You feature it, I'm
assuming, somewhat regularly

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.670 align:middle line:84%
in the magazine, from
different angles.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:47.140 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, is there ever
a valid reason for vaccinating?

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.660 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: You know,
I would never say never.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And we never tell
people not to vaccine.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.700 align:middle line:84%
We tell them to make
up their own minds.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
What I do think, though, is
that weighing-up situation.

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.510 align:middle line:84%
If you have a highly
effective vaccine that's

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.560 align:middle line:84%
been proven out there in
the field to really work,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.939 align:middle line:84%
and you have an epidemic, so
it's necessary, it's safe,

00:43:08.939 --> 00:43:10.480 align:middle line:84%
and you could see
this clear benefit,

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.240 align:middle line:84%
well, then, that's an
equation that stacks up.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.180 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got something
that's not very safe, not

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.025 align:middle line:84%
very effective, then there is
no reason to get vaccinated.

00:43:20.025 --> 00:43:22.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does that include
for your little babies?

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.364 align:middle line:90%
The problem is political.

00:43:23.364 --> 00:43:24.780 align:middle line:84%
How do you get
your kids in school

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.430 align:middle line:90%
without a vaccine record?

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:27.340 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:28.140 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.770 align:middle line:90%
You create a new religion.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:32.770 align:middle line:90%
Or you have a--

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:35.200 align:middle line:84%
I think in a number
of states they

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:41.890 align:middle line:84%
allow a conscientious objection,
basically, that you just

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:43.330 align:middle line:90%
don't believe in this.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:44.657 align:middle line:90%
Some of them allow that.

00:43:44.657 --> 00:43:46.990 align:middle line:84%
Some of them allow it on
religious grounds, some of them

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:48.550 align:middle line:90%
allow it on medical grounds.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And parents-- a lot of parents
homeschool because they

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.710 align:middle line:90%
don't want to vaccinate.

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:54.585 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then they come
after homeschooling.

00:43:54.585 --> 00:43:55.680 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Or they lie.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.990 align:middle line:90%
Or they lie.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:01.150 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, our own view is
that your children come first,

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.050 align:middle line:90%
whatever it takes.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.410 align:middle line:84%
If you don't feel-- if you've
done your homework, and I think

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:06.920 align:middle line:90%
that's the important thing.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.070 align:middle line:90%
This is an individual decision.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Once again, I'm not telling
people not to vaccinate,

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling them to get
educated and to find out

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:16.690 align:middle line:84%
the real truth about how
safe and how dangerous

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.430 align:middle line:90%
these things are.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.920 align:middle line:84%
When you've done all of your
study of every single vaccine

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and made up your decision
based on those three

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.000 align:middle line:84%
questions on every single
vaccine, then follow your truth

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.520 align:middle line:84%
and follow what you think
is right for your child.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the medical
profession will try to bully

00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:39.700 align:middle line:84%
you into accepting this as part
of your responsibility for herd

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:90%
immunity.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, that argument
doesn't stack up, as far

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:48.140 align:middle line:84%
as I'm concerned, because if
these vaccines worked so well,

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:51.670 align:middle line:84%
and I decide not to vaccinate
and you decide to do so, well,

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.820 align:middle line:84%
your child is not going
to get the disease anyway.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.205 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just
lay myself open to it

00:44:56.205 --> 00:44:58.330 align:middle line:84%
and that's my own choice--
or my child open to it--

00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:59.260 align:middle line:90%
it's my own choice.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.740 align:middle line:84%
If it works, we shouldn't
worry about herd immunity.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But herd immunity is
about stopping the disease

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.170 align:middle line:90%
for the general population.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:11.340 align:middle line:90%
It's an epidemiological idea.

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.180 align:middle line:90%
It's not the idea of any parent.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sorry, I would
not sacrifice my children

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:19.060 align:middle line:84%
for an epidemiological
situation,

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:20.810 align:middle line:90%
and nor should anybody.

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.080 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hear, hear.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Know what?

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.219 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk the other
end of the spectrum--

00:45:24.219 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:90%
older people, senior citizens.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.920 align:middle line:84%
In one of the
magazine articles, it

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:32.070 align:middle line:84%
was saying it's not advised
that senior citizens subject

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.870 align:middle line:84%
themselves to vaccines, the
annual flu shots and so forth.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well, the
flu shots don't work.

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:43.860 align:middle line:84%
The best a flu shot can do is
to create a vaccine against one

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.620 align:middle line:90%
strain of flu virus.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, there are a million ones.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, viruses
are very clever things

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.720 align:middle line:90%
that mutate all the time.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So it usually is a vaccine
for last year's flu.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So first of all, it's
not affecting-- you know,

00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.350 align:middle line:84%
it's not effective against
this year's strain.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, it tends to be the
case that one of the major side

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:10.110 align:middle line:90%
effects is flu.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people who
get the flu vaccine

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.637 align:middle line:90%
are sick as dogs with flu.

00:46:14.637 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:90%
But there are many other things.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, think about
the body as strongest

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.770 align:middle line:84%
with a strong immune
system, rather than

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.290 align:middle line:90%
this immunological trick.

00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:30.960 align:middle line:84%
The best way to prevent
flu is to eat healthily,

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.570 align:middle line:84%
take your supplements, do
all of those healthy things.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Live your happy life,
live your dream.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Do all of those things so
you've got emotional, mental,

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:42.040 align:middle line:84%
physical, and
spiritual wellness.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And then you're probably
not going to get flu.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Probably not.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:46.799 align:middle line:84%
We don't have that
much time left

00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:48.840 align:middle line:84%
and we have several things
I want to kind of jump

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.640 align:middle line:90%
through here.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.890 align:middle line:84%
So now we're on
our little laundry

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:54.790 align:middle line:90%
list of different things.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:57.990 align:middle line:84%
One of the articles
was on antidepressants,

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.120 align:middle line:84%
saying that they actually
will create miscarriage

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and can also be
implicated in autism.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.480 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: A really ironic
situation with antidepressants

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.970 align:middle line:84%
is that they are often
given out for women

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:12.600 align:middle line:84%
who are trying to get pregnant,
who are going through IVF.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:18.560 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes there
is no appreciation--

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know
how this could be

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:24.450 align:middle line:84%
in post-thalidomide
medicine, that there's

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.080 align:middle line:84%
no appreciation about what
drugs can do to pregnant women.

00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So they believe that there is
no problem with antidepressants.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's OK to give
them to women who

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.660 align:middle line:84%
are pregnant, because pregnancy
has its ups and downs.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, with women
who are undergoing IVF,

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.730 align:middle line:84%
it's very stressful, et
cetera, so oftentimes they're

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.530 align:middle line:90%
handed an anti-depressant.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And it can cause
the very situation

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:51.300 align:middle line:90%
they're trying to prevent.

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's just, again, medicine is
so bad at joining up the dots.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it's
all about the fact

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:04.320 align:middle line:84%
that doctors have gone through
hell to become a doctor.

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, the whole
medical training situation

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.140 align:middle line:90%
is boot camp times a hundred.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:11.760 align:middle line:90%
It's so hard.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.860 align:middle line:84%
It's so difficult.
It's so bullying.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.192 align:middle line:90%
It's so-- all of those things.

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:17.250 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You come
out with such debt.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yes, exactly.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And you are bullied into
thinking a certain way.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost heresy to
think outside that box.

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:30.234 align:middle line:84%
So they are taught
by rote, essentially,

00:48:30.234 --> 00:48:31.400 align:middle line:90%
to believe in a certain way.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So when a drug comes along and
they think it will alleviate--

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.350 align:middle line:90%
and they want to do good.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:40.200 align:middle line:84%
They want to alleviate
the vast, the morass

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.750 align:middle line:84%
of suffering they see before
them every single day.

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.960 align:middle line:90%
So they're so well-intended.

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So if a drug is supposed
to be good for something,

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:middle line:84%
they want to believe
that it's good for that,

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.551 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to
believe that it also

00:48:52.551 --> 00:48:54.280 align:middle line:90%
causes all of these things.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.590 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's always--

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I always want to emphasize
it's not the carpenter,

00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:59.030 align:middle line:90%
it's his tools.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:01.030 align:middle line:84%
It's not the doctors,
it's the tools

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:04.110 align:middle line:84%
he's been given are just
an inferior set of tools.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And that whole autism link,
this is all part and parcel

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:12.780 align:middle line:84%
of nobody being willing in
medicine to look at the fact

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.300 align:middle line:84%
that maybe medicine
is responsible,

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.700 align:middle line:84%
modern medicine
and various drugs

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.650 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for the
absolute explosion we have

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.470 align:middle line:90%
of autism cases in the West.

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.490 align:middle line:90%
We also want to talk about--

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:middle line:84%
I have a few things--
beta blocker, statins,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.730 align:middle line:90%
and Alzheimer's.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:36.690 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk about
the niacin story.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:41.400 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Niacin is an
example of, once again,

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.610 align:middle line:84%
an example of medicine
wanting to treat

00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:47.370 align:middle line:90%
natural substances like a drug.

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:50.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, niacin is known to be
very effective for preventing

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:51.900 align:middle line:90%
heart disease.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.060 align:middle line:10%
And doctors know this.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.430 align:middle line:10%
They've been giving
niacin for a long time.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.800 align:middle line:10%
But niacin causes a flush.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's because it causes
the arteries to expand,

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.694 align:middle line:90%
so it causes flush--

00:50:04.694 --> 00:50:05.610 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A hot flash.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.010 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah, it's
a hot flash, basically.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
It causes this flush, so
sometimes that's embarrassing.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:14.640 align:middle line:84%
So doctors decide-- or medicine
decided and the drug companies

00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:15.450 align:middle line:90%
decided--

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.470 align:middle line:90%
let's team this up.

00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:19.130 align:middle line:84%
The active ingredient
for niacin,

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:23.580 align:middle line:84%
we'll team up niacin with
an anti-flushing drug.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:26.730 align:middle line:84%
So they did this, and all of
a sudden it started causing

00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:28.480 align:middle line:90%
problems and side effects.

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.270 align:middle line:90%
So the press threw this out.

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:34.510 align:middle line:84%
They got the story as,
niacin doesn't work.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Great heart disease
preventative doesn't work.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.720 align:middle line:90%
And of course, it wasn't that.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It was the drug that
niacin got saddled with,

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.000 align:middle line:84%
they got paired with,
that didn't work.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Niacin has been demonstrated
with lots of research to work.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So it's that kind of thinking
that you can isolate stuff

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.360 align:middle line:84%
like that, you can
isolate an element

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:02.100 align:middle line:84%
or you can pair it
up with a chemical,

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.880 align:middle line:84%
and you can do
that with infinity.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.930 align:middle line:90%
And that's-- or with impunity.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's that whole
concept of the body,

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:14.010 align:middle line:84%
is this kind of collection
of chemicals and chemical

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:15.070 align:middle line:90%
signaling.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So if you give it to--
you give them this

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and you give them
a little of this,

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.610 align:middle line:84%
our bodies are like
a chemistry set,

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:22.580 align:middle line:84%
we can just do
that with impunity.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And you know, we can't.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:25.110 align:middle line:90%
We can't.

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.020 align:middle line:84%
We're much more
complex than that.

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, never
having taken niacin,

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.634 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't it make sense if
you take your niacin tab--

00:51:32.634 --> 00:51:34.050 align:middle line:84%
if it's embarrassing--
I mean, you

00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:35.880 align:middle line:84%
must know the time
it takes before it

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.650 align:middle line:90%
starts expressing the flush.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Can't you just time it so you're
not in a situation publicly?

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Or--

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
what's the big deal?

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.644 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Well,
what's the big deal?

00:51:45.644 --> 00:51:49.890 align:middle line:84%
But you know, I mean, medicine,
doctor, pharmaceutical industry

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:51.450 align:middle line:84%
is always looking
for a new market

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and there was a new
market, you know?

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Hey.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Jumpy leg syndrome.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.770 align:middle line:90%
There's a drug for that, too.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:56.644 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Exactly.

00:51:56.644 --> 00:51:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: What about statins?

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
saying-- this article

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:07.927 align:middle line:84%
is saying-- they actually
cause major artery damage.

00:52:07.927 --> 00:52:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Statins are--

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, statins cause
all kinds of things.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.200 align:middle line:84%
We know they cause
muscle weakness.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.260 align:middle line:84%
We know now they're
demonstrated to-- there's

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.860 align:middle line:84%
been a lot of trumpeting about
statins as the great wonder

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.600 align:middle line:90%
drug for cholesterol.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And they're now finding
more and more and more

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:32.610 align:middle line:84%
side effects with this
drug that are crazy.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:36.480 align:middle line:84%
But the most important point
about the statin scandal

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that really has to be
made is, as we age,

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:42.990 align:middle line:90%
high cholesterol is protective.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:45.170 align:middle line:90%
High cholesterol is protective.

00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And one of the problems
that's happening with lowering

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:53.100 align:middle line:84%
cholesterol artificially through
statins is that people are

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:55.542 align:middle line:84%
suffering memory
loss, Alzheimer's--

00:52:55.542 --> 00:52:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah,
the brain is highly

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.580 align:middle line:84%
dependent upon cholesterol
for its function.

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.580 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And cholesterol isn't--
cholesterol is like the guy who

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.300 align:middle line:90%
runs--

00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:08.490 align:middle line:84%
who gets there first at
the scene of the crime

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and then gets saddled
with blame for the crime.

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So cholesterol is
around the arteries

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:17.040 align:middle line:84%
of the body as a
kind of scaffolding

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.040 align:middle line:90%
to try to keep it open.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Cholesterol has been sent
there by the body to help,

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.100 align:middle line:90%
not to hinder.

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea that we're going
to lower cholesterol really

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.880 align:middle line:84%
has real implications
for older people.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:36.960 align:middle line:84%
So as we see, every time
you try to put a drug--

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.480 align:middle line:84%
stop a natural
process with a drug,

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.130 align:middle line:84%
you cause all kinds
of other problems.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:43.338 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they're
starting to see with statins.

00:53:43.338 --> 00:53:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And one after another negative
story after this wonder drug--

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.500 align:middle line:84%
you know, a couple of decades
after this wonder drug was

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.440 align:middle line:84%
unleashed on the world--
or so-called wonder drug--

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.420 align:middle line:84%
we're now getting the
feedback that it's not

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.070 align:middle line:90%
so wonderful after all.

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:58.470 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: My sister works
as a cardiac care nurse.

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:00.290 align:middle line:90%
And she said--

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I won't mention
which organization,

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:06.180 align:middle line:84%
but she said they have
no answers really,

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:08.460 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to cholesterol
levels and heart health.

00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
so many anomalies

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.170 align:middle line:84%
that there really is nothing
that you can consider normal

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:14.070 align:middle line:90%
per se.

00:54:14.070 --> 00:54:18.630 align:middle line:84%
Depending on that person's own
makeup, their family's makeup--

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:20.250 align:middle line:90%
back to genetics again--

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:23.340 align:middle line:84%
the genetics or whatnot,
that high cholesterol levels

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:26.110 align:middle line:84%
can actually be very
healthy for one individual,

00:54:26.110 --> 00:54:28.350 align:middle line:84%
where maybe not so
much for another one.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can't tell looking at
numbers and taking those tests.

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:32.340 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: No.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.010 align:middle line:84%
There's not a pill
to correct an ill,

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:35.610 align:middle line:84%
but there's one
very simple thing

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.860 align:middle line:84%
to do if you want to
prevent heart disease.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.130 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat processed food.

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Very good.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Don't
eat processed food,

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:47.430 align:middle line:84%
because that is so inextricably
linked with heart disease.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.220 align:middle line:90%
That's got to be number one.

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Number one, OK.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And then also, you and I
were talking off camera

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.200 align:middle line:84%
about the body's own
intelligence itself,

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.160 align:middle line:84%
where if you do start having
blockages to certain arteries,

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.341 align:middle line:90%
that other pathways are made.

00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: This is
the interesting thing

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:04.620 align:middle line:90%
about bypass surgery.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.130 align:middle line:84%
They found when people for some
reason didn't get a bypass,

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:11.330 align:middle line:84%
the body would create
its own little bypass

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that is interrupted if you
go in there for the knife.

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And when there's so many other
problems with bypass surgery,

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:20.260 align:middle line:84%
it behooves you to start
looking at other alternatives.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.490 align:middle line:84%
But the main key, really
simple key to heart disease

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is eat healthy food
high in B vitamins.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat processed food.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:29.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: And stay
out of high-stress jobs.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.240 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Is that right?

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Yes, absolutely.

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Oh, and
finally, get connected.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.410 align:middle line:84%
Half of all heart disease,
from the evidence,

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:41.917 align:middle line:90%
is from just simple loneliness.

00:55:41.917 --> 00:55:42.750 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: It's true.

00:55:42.750 --> 00:55:44.370 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: So stay connected.

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And also,
isn't oxytocin produced

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.160 align:middle line:90%
when you hug one another?

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:48.960 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.320 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.861 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean,
something as simple

00:55:50.861 --> 00:55:53.430 align:middle line:84%
as that starts creating
the very drugs you

00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:55.441 align:middle line:84%
need for your own heart
health and well-being.

00:55:55.441 --> 00:55:56.440 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Absolutely.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And even Dean Ornish
says half of all cases

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of his cases of heart disease
aren't caused by cholesterol.

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They are caused
by just people who

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:06.040 align:middle line:90%
are lonely and not connected.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.017 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, that
makes total sense.

00:56:08.017 --> 00:56:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We only have a couple
of minutes left,

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.720 align:middle line:84%
but we'll just touch on
Alzheimer's very briefly

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:14.917 align:middle line:90%
and the aluminum implication.

00:56:14.917 --> 00:56:16.250 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Really interesting.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:19.920 align:middle line:10%
We covered a story in our
magazine by one of our doctors

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:23.640 align:middle line:10%
who wrote about one of his
patients who had Alzheimer's.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.790 align:middle line:10%
And they couldn't figure
out what was wrong

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:28.710 align:middle line:10%
and they brought him to see him.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And he isolated the fact that
it had to do with two things--

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:35.970 align:middle line:84%
the aluminum in her
deodorant and the mercury

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:37.500 align:middle line:90%
fillings in her mouth.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.800 align:middle line:84%
When both were removed,
she completely got over her

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.940 align:middle line:90%
Alzheimer's.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So oftentimes Alzheimer's can be
caused by basically heavy metal

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:48.660 align:middle line:90%
poisoning.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Can you have
them chelated out as well?

00:56:50.130 --> 00:56:51.130 align:middle line:90%
Is that one way to go?

00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:51.930 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.580 align:middle line:90%
That's a good way to go.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: On one little trick
here, one of our interviewees

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.780 align:middle line:84%
told me off camera, he
said, people are doing this

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:04.320 align:middle line:84%
to their bodies, putting this
aluminum-laced deodorant on.

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.610 align:middle line:84%
He said the best
deodorant in the world

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:07.920 align:middle line:90%
is just fresh lime juice.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.215 align:middle line:84%
Just cut a lime in
half and use it.

00:57:10.215 --> 00:57:11.840 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well,
I'll give it a try.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.640 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:16.230 align:middle line:90%
It's unbelievable.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Lime juice, fresh
lime juice, to me,

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:21.587 align:middle line:84%
works better than any deodorant
I've ever used in my lifetime.

00:57:21.587 --> 00:57:22.670 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: There you go.

00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Chemicals never win their--

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.141 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Getting
some bioflavonoids.

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Yeah.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Good old nature.

00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:29.550 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Any final thoughts?

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.170 align:middle line:84%
We have only just
about a minute left

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:32.940 align:middle line:84%
to kind of wrap up
this conversation

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.284 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll say goodbye.

00:57:34.284 --> 00:57:35.700 align:middle line:84%
It has been a
wonderful two hours.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.824 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Oh, wonderful.

00:57:36.824 --> 00:57:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Well, me too.

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:40.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important message here

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:42.780 align:middle line:84%
is that it's really
important for all of us

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.760 align:middle line:84%
to take control
of our own health.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, medicine has
been brilliant for trauma

00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and for emergencies, without
parallel in the world.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.760 align:middle line:84%
But for every other
chronic problem,

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:56.670 align:middle line:84%
there's a better solution,
a more natural solution.

00:57:56.670 --> 00:58:00.450 align:middle line:84%
And I really encourage
everyone to do their homework

00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:03.600 align:middle line:84%
before submitting to
a pill, and to look

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.436 align:middle line:90%
at drugs as a very last resort.

00:58:07.436 --> 00:58:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Personal responsibility,
the one thing

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.910 align:middle line:84%
that, certainly in
American culture

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:15.430 align:middle line:84%
and in the West at large,
we seem to want to avoid.

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Lynne, thank you so
much for your time.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:18.360 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful magazine.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.080 align:middle line:84%
>>MCTAGGART: Thank
you very much.

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.954 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact, I'm
getting a subscription

00:58:20.954 --> 00:58:22.540 align:middle line:84%
for my British
mother-in-law to that.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.498 align:middle line:90%
>>MCTAGGART: Wonderful.

00:58:23.498 --> 00:58:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Thanks so much.

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:26.538 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Again, to have
access to this wonderful new

00:58:26.538 --> 00:58:29.020 align:middle line:10%

Doctors Don't Tell You,"

And you can also get an
online edition as well as one

through an app.

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:46.160 align:middle line:84%
