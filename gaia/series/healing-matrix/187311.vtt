a unique practice that
brings about positive change

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:10%
in our thoughts, behaviors,
and body's natural ability

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.220 align:middle line:10%
for self-healing.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:10%

and "Awakening to the
Secret Code of your Mind".

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:10%
He's here to share with
us his technique that

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.160 align:middle line:10%
can help us activate our amazing
potential for self-healing.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Weissman, thank you so
much for joining us today.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.000 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the impetus for you
to go down this path that's now

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:84%
been bringing so much
healing to people?

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:10%
>> The impetus was my own
childhood and challenges that I

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.910 align:middle line:10%
had with my health struggling
with asthma, allergies,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.233 align:middle line:10%
sinus infections,
ear infections,

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:10%
multiple surgeries
that I went through--

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.000 align:middle line:10%
and really desiring a different
experience other than what I

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:10%
had.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So I always thought
as a kid how neat

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:84%
it would be to have
an original idea.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know about
holistic medicine.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:10%
So I was studying
premed, not really

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:10%
cold for the concept of taking
a pill for every symptom,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.270 align:middle line:10%
but I didn't know any different.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And my brother was
in a car accident,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.070 align:middle line:90%
went the medical route.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't work out for
him-- the muscle relaxers,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.130 align:middle line:84%
pain pills, the
anti-inflammatories--

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and he ended up
seeing a chiropractor.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:90%
Totally changed his life.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.280 align:middle line:84%
He called me up and said,
you've got to check out

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:90%
chiropractic, Darren.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:90%
This is the profession for you.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.060 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't know what it was.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:90%
But that was the impetus.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Once I found it, it opened up
a passionate door in my heart.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.030 align:middle line:90%
I discovered acupuncture.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:90%
I discovered kinesiology.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I started traveling around the
world studying in Sri Lanka

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.520 align:middle line:84%
and China, studying just
with people that were masters

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
at activating our innate
potential for self-healing,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.620 align:middle line:84%
for adapting, for becoming
resilient as a result of going

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:90%
through things.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And I had a moment that I call
my faith versus fear moment,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
that I woke up to something
that was an original idea.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.500 align:middle line:84%
I saw everything
that had studied,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
with everyone I had studied
with around the world, come

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
to me in a vision with clarity
of a system that now is being

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.530 align:middle line:84%
used around the world to help
people create positive change.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> And that system, is that
the Lifeline Technique?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Or is the Lifeline Technique
an aspect of the system?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.267 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the system,
the Lifeline Technique.

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's get into that.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.270 align:middle line:90%
What is the Lifeline Technique?

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, simply put, it is a
process for helping people step

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.020 align:middle line:84%
into the next greatest
version of themself.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So that could be the
health of their body,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
could be the health of
their relationships,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
could be what they do
for a living or a loving.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a process that
enables a person

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
to make a change on
a subconscious level,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.388 align:middle line:84%
and therefore influence our
fullest potential, period.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying, if we can
program the subconscious mind,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.520 align:middle line:84%
this will actually put into
motion these healthy patterns?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, the subconscious
mind, everything comes from it.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It makes up 90% to
98% of our reality.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Yet, it's invisible.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It's subconscious.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.120 align:middle line:84%
It's below the surface
like a submarine.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't see it.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:90%
You can't feel it directly.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's orchestrating
the trillions

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.500 align:middle line:84%
of cells in our body, our
heart rate, our blood sugar

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
metabolism, our muscle tone.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It's influencing how we think,
how we feel, how we perceive,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.810 align:middle line:90%
because it stores memories.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.550 align:middle line:90%
Everything's stored within it.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And the amazing
thing about it, Ben,

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.290 align:middle line:84%
is that it's seven times
faster than our greatest

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.820 align:middle line:90%
ninja-trained self.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.430 align:middle line:84%
So as much as we might
be awesome at meditating

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and visualization
and affirmations,

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.120 align:middle line:84%
the reality is the subconscious
mind will always show up first.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's constantly
being triggered.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So the Lifeline
Technique, what it does,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
is it helps us to create
a loving relationship

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.510 align:middle line:84%
with this purely reactive part
of ourself, so that we can--

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
as you were saying--

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.440 align:middle line:84%
reprogram our mind to
influence our reality.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the people who has
used and endorses the Lifeline

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Technique is author and
researcher, Gregg Braden.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.910 align:middle line:84%
He talks here about
his experience

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
in the documentary, "Heal".

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.340 align:middle line:10%
>> My dear friend and spiritual
brother and colleague,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:10%
Darren Weissman, calls a portal.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
He says every illness,
every disease,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.990 align:middle line:90%
it's a portal into our bodies.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.290 align:middle line:84%
The question is, are we willing
to step through that portal

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.520 align:middle line:84%
to look and see when our
body is actually telling us?

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.120 align:middle line:84%
And when our answer
to that is yes,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
then we begin to see that
our body is simply reflecting

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:84%
energetically the quality
of the belief that we hold.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.550 align:middle line:84%
I've had a personal experience
with portals of my body

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:90%
helping me to embrace my past.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And Dr. Darren Weissman
was the catalyst

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.880 align:middle line:84%
that helped me to
understand and make

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:90%
this connection in my life.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the end of
the conversation,

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
the redness of the rash
was completely gone.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.600 align:middle line:90%
And the swelling was gone.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And by the next
morning, the rash

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:90%
was gone and has never returned.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And that is a powerful
testament to me.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.390 align:middle line:84%
It tells me how these
subconscious beliefs,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.800 align:middle line:84%
how they show up in our lives
in times that we least expect

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.080 align:middle line:84%
at the most inopportune time,
sometimes, and what a clear--

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.230 align:middle line:84%
a really clear
communication they

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.990 align:middle line:84%
are presenting us
with if we learn

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.995 align:middle line:90%
the language of our bodies.

00:06:20.995 --> 00:06:21.870 align:middle line:90%
>> That's incredible.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Gregg Braden, probably
as woke as you can get,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:84%
who experienced something very
profound in a healing symptom.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
examples of, let's say,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.000 align:middle line:84%
clients that wouldn't be
his level of understanding

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.050 align:middle line:84%
these things, that came into the
Lifeline Technique that found

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
also the healing, or at least
some alleviation of some

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.450 align:middle line:90%
of their physical symptoms?

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Over, and over, and
over, and over again.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
I've done over 100,000
sessions myself.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.008 align:middle line:84%
And I've trained people
all over the world in using

00:06:53.008 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:90%
this for themselves and others.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:90%
So whether it be--

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and here's the thing.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.810 align:middle line:84%
The Lifeline isn't
about healing disease.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
making a rash go away

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.660 align:middle line:90%
or making any disease go away.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.790 align:middle line:84%
It's about raising consciousness
from a subconscious

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:10.590 align:middle line:90%
perspective.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
It's about making a connection
with a part of ourself that's

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.920 align:middle line:84%
been in this
"Groundhog Day" cycle

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and awakening, from our
heart, this power to choose--

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
with love-- what is authentic
for us in any given moment.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.483 align:middle line:84%
As Gregg was saying,
there's a conversation.

00:07:30.483 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what the Lifeline is.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.720 align:middle line:84%
It's a conversation
with the subconscious.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So I've had people with
anaphylactic allergies.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I've had people with compression
fractures in their spine, all

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.100 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden, on
X-ray, they can't

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.930 align:middle line:90%
find the compression fracture.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
I've had people diagnosed
with all kinds of things

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.630 align:middle line:84%
that no longer have those
particular diseases.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
I've had people go through
extraordinary trauma, shock,

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:84%
survivors of the
Rwandan genocide,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to people that have
experienced major accidents

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:12.240 align:middle line:84%
in their life that have affected
the trajectory of where they

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
are and what they
think is possible,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:84%
to now, after this fire that
they lived through that so

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:84%
many people were killed,
instead of that being

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.590 align:middle line:84%
the end of their
life, all of a sudden,

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.280 align:middle line:84%
they're able to perceive it
from another vantage point.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And when we change
our perception, when

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
we change how we're viewing
something, what we view

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:90%
begins to change.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.039 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, the
loss, the trauma, the shock,

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.330 align:middle line:84%
the disease, we're
designed to heal.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:90%
We're designed to regenerate.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
We're designed to be kind
and loving and compassionate

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.230 align:middle line:90%
for ourselves and each other.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we have this part of
ourself that gets triggered

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:90%
and it takes over.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we apply
particular steps,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
then the fullest potential
of healing physically,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, spiritually,
is set into motion.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's understand the
subconscious mind a little bit

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.925 align:middle line:84%
Are there aspects of it that
we can understand better?

00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:17.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost,
it's an energy field.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:90%
It's an intelligence.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.050 align:middle line:90%
It's an information field.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.230 align:middle line:84%
It stores better than
any computer system

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that we could ever imagine,
bigger than the world wide web.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.040 align:middle line:90%
It stores everything.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:84%
Now when we're conceived
into this world, when we're

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
born into this world,
from conception to 7,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:84%
our subconscious mind
is like wet cement.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that,
it's very impressionable.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:84%
And everything that's going
on between conception and 7

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:90%
is imprinted.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Patterns of love
or patterns of fear

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.780 align:middle line:84%
are imprinted in our
subconscious mind.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.510 align:middle line:84%
When there are
fear-based patterns,

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
when people at these
particular ages--

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
obviously, we don't
have tools to say,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:84%
to speak up for ourselves and to
advocate for ourselves at these

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
young ages, when our environment
cannot be a light that supports

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
us with love to confidently move
through the emotional stressors

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.090 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.610 align:middle line:84%
What the subconscious
mind does is

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:90%
it stores that memory in a file.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.680 align:middle line:84%
But it does something
absolutely fascinating, Ben.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:90%
It programs us to forget.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
It's called T minus 1,
where the perceived trauma,

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.270 align:middle line:84%
the emotionally reactive
environment, is stored--

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.060 align:middle line:84%
all the senses, all the colors,
all the sounds, all the smells,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:84%
all the feelings are
stored in this file.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:90%
But it backs up one millisecond.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:84%
So we're programmed
to forget it.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
But the triggers
of the environment

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.750 align:middle line:90%
still live within us.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And all it takes--

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.320 align:middle line:90%
here I am at 51 years young--

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
all it takes is the right color,
sound, smell, and then boom,

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.380 align:middle line:84%
that five your young
memory comes to life.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:90%
And guess what's happening?

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.240 align:middle line:84%
My heart's beating as if I was
5 in that environment, of anger,

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.420 align:middle line:90%
of anxiety, of low self-esteem.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.800 align:middle line:84%
My immune system is affected as
if I was 5 in that environment.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Everything, my lens
and how I see myself

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and the world around
me, my wife, my kids,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I become a five-year-old.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a good dad
or a husband when

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm a five-year-old, right?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:90%
But that happens to us.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The brain and the
body don't know

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.490 align:middle line:84%
the difference between memory
or reality or imagination.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result,
the subconscious mind

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.410 align:middle line:90%
speaks to us through symptoms.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.900 align:middle line:84%
It speaks to us through
patterns that we

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
can begin to recognize
as a portal, as

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:84%
a doorway to the next
greatest version of ourself.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.090 align:middle line:90%
And so it's so profound.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> We're programmed to forget.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure there's got to
be some evolutionary component

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.930 align:middle line:90%
to this that's very important.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.690 align:middle line:84%
But can we program
ourselves to remember?

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.360 align:middle line:90%
That's such a great question.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, the essence
of the subconscious mind

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:20.740 align:middle line:84%
is its first initiation
and purpose is protection.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So that program to
forget is to protect us

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.820 align:middle line:84%
when we don't have the
ability to process emotions

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.620 align:middle line:90%
at the moment.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Because when we're forced
to process emotions

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.380 align:middle line:84%
that we can't process, do
you know what happens to us?

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.200 align:middle line:90%
We die.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.310 align:middle line:84%
If we have to process emotions
that we cannot process,

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.830 align:middle line:84%
that we do not have tools
or strategies or support,

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.600 align:middle line:90%
we literally die.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:90%
So we're programmed to forget.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So what ends up happening
is, as I was talking,

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
it starts to
broadcast this signal.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And the broadcasting of the
signal of the five-year-old,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
for example, that's
not protection anymore.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
That isn't a protective alarm,
that is an alarm to wake us up.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So the second function
of the subconscious mind

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.380 align:middle line:90%
is an ascension.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:90%
It's an awakening.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.110 align:middle line:84%
It is to empower us to raise
our consciousness in a way

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:84%
that we'd otherwise
not even know that we

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.750 align:middle line:90%
weren't being conscious.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.140 align:middle line:90%
So two things.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Number one, it's
protective on every level.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.680 align:middle line:90%
I touch a flame, I move away.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.660 align:middle line:84%
I get my spidey senses when I'm
around someone and I'm like,

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.510 align:middle line:84%
They look cool and
stuff like that,

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.800 align:middle line:90%
but something doesn't trust.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.267 align:middle line:84%
Like, these are all
subconscious adaptation skills

00:13:40.267 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:90%
that are protective.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:90%
They're amazing.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.040 align:middle line:84%
But when it isn't true
protection in the moment

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and there's a pattern that's
painful, scary, stressful,

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
that is the second role
of the subconscious mind.

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And that purpose is to awaken
us to the next greatest

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.160 align:middle line:90%
version of ourself.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Back on the
lifeline technique,

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
there's a flow chart that
seems really interesting

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.410 align:middle line:90%
and powerful.

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.368 align:middle line:84%
Could you explain what
that is and even how

00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:07.660 align:middle line:90%
you discovered this flow chart?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:84%
It was one of the most
astounding moments

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:18.480 align:middle line:84%
of my life in awakening to the
lifeline technique flow chart.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Just a quick backstory, I was
with my dear friends, Dr. Tom

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Bane and Dr. Ingrid Moss.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:90%
And we were having a meal.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
And Ingrid said, so
where's the big idea?

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.280 align:middle line:84%
Because Tom and I were
looking for something.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.188 align:middle line:84%
We knew that there was something
at the core of symptoms,

00:14:35.188 --> 00:14:37.230 align:middle line:84%
other than needing to just
adjust somebody again,

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.310 align:middle line:84%
other than needing to just put a
needle in again in acupuncture,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.930 align:middle line:84%
other than just
doing homeopathy.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like, why don't
these things hold?

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.250 align:middle line:84%
We knew that there
was something.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And I knew on some level that
it was subconsciously based,

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
I just didn't know
how to access it.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And Ingrid said
to me these words

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:56.920 align:middle line:90%
that forever changed my life.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.380 align:middle line:84%
She said, Darren, do you want
to know why you haven't come up

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.030 align:middle line:90%
with this big idea?

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, what do you mean?

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.520 align:middle line:84%
She goes, do you want
to know the truth?

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, I'm like, what
are you talking about?

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.200 align:middle line:84%
She goes, you haven't
come up with this big idea

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.740 align:middle line:84%
because you're just too afraid
of how powerful it will be.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And that moment
shook me in my soul.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have anything
else to say at that point.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.280 align:middle line:84%
My girlfriend-- who's
now my wife of 16 years--

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.600 align:middle line:90%
and I, we left.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pacing the floor hearing
Ingrid's voice in my mind

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
going, you're just too afraid,
you're just too afraid,

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:90%
like nails on a chalkboard.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And I had a moment where I felt
the crown of my head open up.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:90%
And I entered a space between.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.270 align:middle line:90%
I entered a realm.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And I saw everything
that I'd ever studied,

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.822 align:middle line:84%
everything that I'd ever
been curious about, all

00:15:49.822 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:90%
these different things.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I started to see images
and patterns and words.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And I yelled to my wife,
Sari, I said, babe,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.398 align:middle line:90%
get me a pen and paper.

00:15:59.398 --> 00:16:00.440 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to lose it.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.482 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to miss it.

00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:03.148 align:middle line:84%
I knew that it was
just going to come in

00:16:03.148 --> 00:16:04.550 align:middle line:90%
and out if I didn't capture it.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote furiously and just
passionately 30, 40 minutes.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote out this flow chart.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We have an image
of it right here.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.795 align:middle line:84%
So could you take us maybe just
through a couple of the steps

00:16:17.795 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:90%
of it so we can understand?

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's
intricate, right?

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It's intricate, but
it's really simple.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:90%
It's like a snowflake.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.750 align:middle line:90%
It's H2O.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
It's just ornate, and
nothing's quite like it.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
So there's 16 steps to
the Lifeline Technique.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:10%
And each of them
guides us as a means

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.160 align:middle line:10%
for making a connection
with the subconscious mind

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.530 align:middle line:10%
by establishing present
time consciousness.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.270 align:middle line:10%
It's called the connection.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.370 align:middle line:10%
I can show you how we do that.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.180 align:middle line:10%
It guides us through a
process of setting intention.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.840 align:middle line:84%
It guides us in creating
a portal, a doorway

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:90%
into the subconscious mind.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
This is a roadmap.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.530 align:middle line:10%
This is a blueprint of
the subconscious mind

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.349 align:middle line:10%
that with kinesiology,
muscle reflex testing,

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:07.880 align:middle line:10%
I never have to guess.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Either there is a pattern that's
reactive and subconscious,

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:90%
or there's not.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.819 align:middle line:84%
So it's not subjective
as far as like, oh,

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:90%
this is what's going to happen.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.607 align:middle line:84%
Or, I am literally-- in doing a
lifeline with myself or holding

00:17:22.607 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:84%
a space with another person, or
teaching someone to do it with

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.000 align:middle line:90%
themself--

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm literally creating
a conscious dialogue

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.700 align:middle line:84%
with the subconscious
part of me.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And what's amazing
about this, Ben,

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
is that there is
a philosophy here

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.740 align:middle line:84%
that there's only
portals, not problems.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.980 align:middle line:84%
There's a science here
of psychoneuroimmunology,

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.680 align:middle line:84%
of epigenetics, of
neuroneuropeptides.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a technology of
step-by-step process.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:84%
But one of the neatest things
is it's an interpreter.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:84%
It's an interpreter
of the language,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
of the symptoms and
disease and stress

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and patterns that absolutely
are so tough in life.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:12.020 align:middle line:84%
And it helps us to
understand why they're there.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.430 align:middle line:84%
It interprets and it gives
language to the shoulder,

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%
to the immune system,
to the behavior that's

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
self-defeating or
self-destructive or insecure.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It interprets it in a
way that is very unique.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You were in
the film "Emotion"

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.970 align:middle line:84%
with some heavy hitters, Dr. Joe
Dispenza, Neale Donald Walsch,

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Don Pullman, all
speaking about emotion.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
What is the power of emotion
in regards to our health?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything-- everything comes
down to our ability to keep

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.140 align:middle line:90%
energy in motion.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.140 align:middle line:84%
When energy is in
motion, blood is flowing.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:90%
Ideas are creative.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:90%
Relationships are evolving.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to be
emotional beings--

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
which we are fully
emotional beings--

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
and process our emotions,
in my humble opinion,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.410 align:middle line:84%
is the most important thing
a human being could ever

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:90%
learn to do.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.320 align:middle line:84%
In our world today, Ben, where
things are so polarized--

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:32.420 align:middle line:84%
whether it be about gun
issues, politics, immigration--

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
you pick any situation,
it's not about the gun.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:84%
It's not about
anything other than,

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.990 align:middle line:90%
can you process your emotions?

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:84%
When a person can process their
emotions rather than being

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.550 align:middle line:84%
a reactive person that does
bad things-- dangerous things--

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
to themselves and
other people, when

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
we can process our emotions,
we become compassionate.

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:90%
We become empathetic.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:04.480 align:middle line:84%
We become aware of other
ways of moving through life.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.630 align:middle line:90%
We become kind, naturally.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
When we're not able to
process our emotions,

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.520 align:middle line:90%
these begin to build up.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And when they build
up, not only are

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.310 align:middle line:84%
they affecting our
behavior and our thoughts,

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.150 align:middle line:84%
but they're directly influencing
the health of our body.

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Anger is going to
influence the liver.

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.710 align:middle line:84%
It's going to influence
the knees and the shoulder.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect
blood sugar metabolism.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Low self-esteem is going
to affect our ability

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:90%
to break down protein.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect
our immune system.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Grief is going to affect
our ability to breathe

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.390 align:middle line:84%
and our intestine's
ability, our biome,

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
and how we are able to have
a strong immune system.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.770 align:middle line:84%
Every emotion correlates
with parts of the body.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:90%
This is Chinese medicine.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Five Element Theory.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
The lifeline technique, being 16
steps, is an integration of 14

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:06.010 align:middle line:84%
plus systems all into one
unified system that people

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:08.380 align:middle line:90%
learn to use for themselves.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Some people learn to use it
as a practice and a profession

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.360 align:middle line:90%
for others.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But its greatest tool is to
process our emotions so we can

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:90%
live every day with intention.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You just mentioned a bunch
of emotions that many people try

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.260 align:middle line:90%
to even shy away from.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:84%
Should we be feeling
all of our feelings

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:90%
as deeply as we can feel them?

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
If we want to heal,
we got to feel.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
Now that's not
always easy to do.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.060 align:middle line:90%
That's hard.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:90%
That's hard when someone dies.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
That's hard when
there's an accident.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.280 align:middle line:84%
That's hard when
you get that call.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.290 align:middle line:90%
And everyone gets that call.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has that moment
where the wind is taken out

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:84%
of our sail and we're
like, oh my goodness.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.720 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
take another step?

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Our ability to have a tool to
process our emotions is epic.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Unless we have a tool to
activate our mind's fullest

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:84%
potential, you know what
happens to our mind?

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:90%
It becomes a tormentor.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to come up, as we
were saying, with these ideas,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:84%
with these beliefs
that directly influence

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.730 align:middle line:84%
how we're able to perceive
things and how we're not.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.330 align:middle line:84%
So this ability to
feel our feelings

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.090 align:middle line:84%
and have a process for
doing this, that's what's

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.770 align:middle line:90%
called the Lifeline Technique.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.690 align:middle line:84%
There's one part that's
called the See, Feel, Hear.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.440 align:middle line:84%
The See, Feel, Hear process
is how we process emotions.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:90%
We see, we're visual.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.730 align:middle line:90%
We feel, we're kinesthetic.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.860 align:middle line:90%
We hear, we're auditory.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.780 align:middle line:90%
That's how our brain works.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.540 align:middle line:84%
That's how our
nervous system works.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:90%
You want to learn something?

00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:90%
You want to heal?

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:84%
You want to evolve into the next
greatest version of yourself?

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.380 align:middle line:84%
You've got to see it,
feel it, and hear it.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So the See, Feel,
Hear process, which

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:10.250 align:middle line:84%
is a part of the
Lifeline Technique,

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:84%
enables us to look at, whether
it be the health of your body.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Like, think about it right
now in your own life.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.970 align:middle line:84%
Think about an
aspect of your health

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:84%
that, if you could shift,
if you could optimize,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:84%
if you could influence the
heal, you'd be like, oh my god.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm so grateful that I had this
conversation with Dr. Darren.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:90%
This is really cool.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.927 align:middle line:90%
Like, connect to something.

00:23:31.927 --> 00:23:33.260 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to talk about it.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.430 align:middle line:90%
But are you thinking about it?

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Now as you're
thinking about that,

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.600 align:middle line:84%
what emotion does that
cause you to feel?

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Anxiety.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.300 align:middle line:90%
>> There you go.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
So I want to-- do you
mind if I lead you

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.860 align:middle line:90%
through something here?

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Cool.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do this.

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:45.685 align:middle line:90%
This is so beautiful.

00:23:45.685 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And I want to show you
and people observing this

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:90%
how simple this process can be.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:58.190 align:middle line:84%
This means "I love you"
in American Sign Language.

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And the words infinite
love and gratitude,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.260 align:middle line:84%
that's the secret sauce
of the Lifeline Technique.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:08.060 align:middle line:84%
So how do we make a change
on a subconscious level?

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:12.440 align:middle line:84%
We go like this, infinite love
and gratitude, infinite love

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.760 align:middle line:90%
and gratitude.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So when I go infinite
love and gratitude, that's

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.010 align:middle line:84%
going to be the sign, Ben, you
go infinite love and gratitude

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.620 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.350 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to guide you
through a See, Feel, Hear.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So in your mind, imagine
you're in a movie theater.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And observe the
thoughts of anxiety

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:33.550 align:middle line:84%
that stem from this symptom,
this aspect of your health.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.800 align:middle line:84%
Observe the memories that
are coming up right now.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And as you're tuning in-- and
they're just going to pop up

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.020 align:middle line:84%
in your mind as you're observing
those thoughts of anxiety--

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.478 align:middle line:84%
go like this, infinite
love and gratitude.

00:24:43.478 --> 00:24:44.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:47.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything
else to see?

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.341 align:middle line:90%
No, feel.

00:24:53.341 --> 00:24:54.960 align:middle line:90%
Feel the anxiety.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.010 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing quite like it.

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.260 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing quite like it.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Give yourself permission to
allow your heart to beat.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Notice where the anxiety is
living inside of you as you're

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.060 align:middle line:84%
connecting to this physical
symptom, this health

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:10.568 align:middle line:84%
Where do you feel the
anxiety inside you?

00:25:10.568 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm curious.

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably closer to the
scapula, to be honest,

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.290 align:middle line:90%
in my back.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it physically
feel like, the anxiety?

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:19.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Tension.

00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:22.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And what do you rate that
tension of anxiety close

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.980 align:middle line:90%
to the scapula?

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.897 align:middle line:90%
What do you rate that?

00:25:23.897 --> 00:25:25.330 align:middle line:90%
0 is nothing, 10's the most.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.580 align:middle line:90%
What do you rate it right now?

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Probably, roughly around 3.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:90%
>> About a 3?

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:30.718 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit, just
enough to get your attention.

00:25:30.718 --> 00:25:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And go like this until you start
to feel that tension shift.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.260 align:middle line:90%
Just go like this.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.330 align:middle line:84%
Think about that area
around your scapula.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.288 align:middle line:84%
Think about the anxiety
connected that symptom.

00:25:38.288 --> 00:25:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And just go infinite
love and gratitude.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.018 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:25:46.018 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.935 align:middle line:84%
>> As you're starting
to feel it shift,

00:25:48.935 --> 00:25:51.003 align:middle line:84%
just let me know just
by giving me a nod.

00:25:51.003 --> 00:25:52.170 align:middle line:90%
Infinite love and gratitude.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Infinite love and gratitude.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.727 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there anything
else to feel?

00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:59.390 align:middle line:90%
No, listen to the voice inside.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Hear the voice of anxiety.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.850 align:middle line:90%
Give it a voice.

00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Hear what it's
saying to you, Ben.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It has a message.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you're hearing
what that voice is saying,

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:15.780 align:middle line:84%
let me know just
by going like this.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious, what
did it say to you?

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> It pretty much just
said the word "help".

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Help, help, help, help.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So let me-- let
me ask real quick.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:31.390 align:middle line:84%
The hand motions being,
like, almost like a mudra.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a mudra.

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's a physical
way to use the body--

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:42.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --mashed with words and
focusing attention on something

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.950 align:middle line:90%
within the body.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:44.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right on.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Why these components?

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Why the mixture of
active use of the body

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and focusing the
intention and the words?

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Because this, to me,
in all my research,

00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:00.160 align:middle line:84%
gets a lot into the
territory of magic--

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.600 align:middle line:84%
you know, using the body,
focusing the attention,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.710 align:middle line:90%
sometimes alchemy.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So, like, is this what you
happen to stumble upon,

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
using active use of the
body, focusing the attention

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.650 align:middle line:84%
and bringing words in
that are just very clear?

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The thoughts, the
feelings, the words,

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:28.300 align:middle line:84%
the intentions of infinite love
and gratitude is an energy.

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's a unique energy
because it's a universal healing

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.520 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
someone's political stances

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.860 align:middle line:90%
or religious background.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.560 align:middle line:84%
Infinite love and
gratitude is for anyone.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.790 align:middle line:90%
There's no blockage for it.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way of once we connect
with the body or an emotion--

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:90%
a thought, a feeling, a voice--

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.660 align:middle line:84%
we've created an
active connection

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.922 align:middle line:90%
with the subconscious.

00:27:56.922 --> 00:27:58.630 align:middle line:84%
As we were just doing
what we were doing,

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:02.530 align:middle line:84%
I was using muscle testing to
know, yep, we've activated it.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:07.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's the combination
of particular steps--

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.000 align:middle line:84%
seeing, feeling, hearing--
muscle testing to know I've got

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.950 align:middle line:90%
the subconscious mind onboard.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And once I know that
I've got the subconscious

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.980 align:middle line:84%
mind in a reactive state,
we literally go like this.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's simple, yet profound,
infinite love and gratitude.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.920 align:middle line:84%
We know we've created a change
on a subconscious level.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.350 align:middle line:84%
Because what once
triggered the subconscious,

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:35.650 align:middle line:84%
what once triggered the
muscle to give way no longer

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.700 align:middle line:90%
gives way.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's our
checks and balance.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:84%
That's our feedback
so that we no change

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.010 align:middle line:84%
actually occurred on
a subconscious level.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this what you
would call mind medicine?

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:10%
This is-- the
Lifeline Technique is

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:58.420 align:middle line:10%
a process for manifesting
a true chemical

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.350 align:middle line:10%
change in the body
using the mind as a tool

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:05.650 align:middle line:10%
to literally produce
and reproduce

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.350 align:middle line:10%
and replicate the placebo.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.190 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
power of our thoughts

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
directly influences the
healing of our body.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Harvard studies up to 95%
success rate with the placebo.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we invest
trillions of dollars

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.030 align:middle line:84%
into using a pill
to control our body.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:31.690 align:middle line:84%
What if we invested into
understanding the steps

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:84%
for accessing the
mind to influence

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:39.310 align:middle line:84%
the chemistry and the feelings
within ourselves to create

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.468 align:middle line:90%
change?

00:29:40.468 --> 00:29:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you think
that would take?

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.512 align:middle line:84%
With the current
biomedical paradigm

00:29:43.512 --> 00:29:45.220 align:middle line:84%
that we have right
now, what do you think

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.430 align:middle line:90%
it would take for us to even--

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.740 align:middle line:84%
us, I would say,
the royal "we"--

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.880 align:middle line:84%
to understand that this
is really the direction

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:90%
we need to go?

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's, how should I say?

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.260 align:middle line:84%
It would even-- it
would be far cheaper

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.760 align:middle line:90%
in terms of health care.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's far more in line with
where I believe we're actually

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:middle line:90%
headed as a species.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.970 align:middle line:84%
What do you think it
would take for people

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.880 align:middle line:84%
to accept and acknowledge
that this is, let's say,

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.020 align:middle line:90%
the future of medicine?

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it already is.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:90%
It's already in motion.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.330 align:middle line:90%
What will it take?

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:90%
One person at a time.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:90%
I-- you know-- learned early on.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.210 align:middle line:90%
I woke up to this.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.980 align:middle line:90%
This is a weird process.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.340 align:middle line:90%
This is a weird process.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:25.570 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm proud of myself with
is that I was courageous enough

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.560 align:middle line:90%
to stay with this.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:31.480 align:middle line:84%
June 17, 2002 is when
I woke up to this.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:35.277 align:middle line:84%
So this June 17 was my
17th year anniversary.

00:30:35.277 --> 00:30:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And now the Lifeline's in 24
countries around the world.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:38.620 align:middle line:90%
I have taught people.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.730 align:middle line:90%
And people are using this.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And changes are
going on everyday.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.170 align:middle line:84%
People are starting to
do research on this.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And so, to me,
rather than needing

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.920 align:middle line:84%
to prove so that big
pharma makes a change,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm not attached to that.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I've been invited
by medical schools

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to speak to doctors and nurses
about what it is that we do,

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.290 align:middle line:84%
so that we can bridge
the gap in the world.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Medicine has its place.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:04.990 align:middle line:90%
It's important.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:09.070 align:middle line:84%
Yet, our greatest healer
exists within and having

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
a tool for this, which people
are more open than ever

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000 align:middle line:84%
to having real tools for
creating positive change.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the Lifeline
manifestation steps?

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to understand this.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's cool.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
So the manifestation steps
are about getting present.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And that's through a process
called the connection.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It establishes
present-time consciousness.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Another way to look at that is
before I play an instrument,

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.880 align:middle line:90%
I've gotta tune it.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is an incredible
instrument, our mind, our body,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.030 align:middle line:84%
our spirit, our
connection to the Earth,

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.410 align:middle line:90%
our connection to the universe.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
step-by-step process

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:52.960 align:middle line:84%
in the manifestation system
where we tune our instrument.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.350 align:middle line:84%
The second aspect of
the manifestation system

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.040 align:middle line:90%
is about setting intention.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's four
particular parts.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.230 align:middle line:84%
It's about observing
the portals.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Where's your body
speaking to you?

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:10.300 align:middle line:84%
What are the diseases that are
going on physically, mentally?

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.250 align:middle line:90%
Where are you stressed in life?

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.450 align:middle line:90%
Financially?

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Relationship-wise?

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Family?

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:90%
We observe those first.

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:22.070 align:middle line:84%
We take inventory rather than
getting caught in the story,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:23.870 align:middle line:90%
And we acknowledge.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that's the
subconscious mind.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Those symptoms and
stressors are the tip

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.870 align:middle line:84%
of the iceberg what's
below the surface.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:32.840 align:middle line:90%
So we acknowledge it.

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Then we ask what's
called a truth question.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.295 align:middle line:84%
And that enables us to shift
judgment into discernment.

00:32:40.295 --> 00:32:42.670 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, after we
observe symptoms and stressors

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.660 align:middle line:84%
in our body, we start
judging ourselves.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm a failure.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm sick.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm weak.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm not good enough.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.220 align:middle line:84%
But judgment won't do
anything to move us forward.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So we ask a question, and
it's a real simple question,

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:55.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's a
game-changing question.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Hey, if you could choose
to create your life--

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:58.900 align:middle line:90%
a day or moment--

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.920 align:middle line:84%
this disease of
autoimmune disease,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.440 align:middle line:84%
this pain in your back,
this digestive challenge,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.280 align:middle line:84%
that anxiety, that
fear, that anger,

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.530 align:middle line:84%
would you choose to create
your life with this?

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And everyone that's
asked this question

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:15.560 align:middle line:90%
answers it the same way.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.310 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's called
the truth question.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:18.710 align:middle line:90%
The answer is, hell no.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Hell no.

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.890 align:middle line:90%
No one chooses cancer.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Not one person has ever
chosen anaphylactic allergies.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.230 align:middle line:90%
No one chooses to be an addict.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:90%
This is the subconscious mind.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.240 align:middle line:84%
So once we ask that
question, now we're

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.850 align:middle line:84%
in a discerning place rather
than judgmental place.

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:84%
And now we can lead
the subconscious mind.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And now we follow particular,
what I call two golden rules

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.490 align:middle line:90%
for setting intention.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.700 align:middle line:84%
We use our imagination
to bring out

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.120 align:middle line:84%
a feeling tone of what it
feels like to imagine ourselves

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.250 align:middle line:90%
already as our best self.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.360 align:middle line:90%
And that feeling?

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the mind medicine.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
When we're feeling
our future self--

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:84%
healthy, strong,
confident, brave, right?

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Living the life
we love to live--

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:06.860 align:middle line:84%
that feeling that we get inside,
light, powerful, grounded,

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.970 align:middle line:90%
that's actual medicine.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Those are chemical reactions
going on inside of the body

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.170 align:middle line:84%
because we use our mind
properly as a tool.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.201 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
manifestation steps.

00:34:17.201 --> 00:34:19.409 align:middle line:84%
>> You mentioned something
called the truth question.

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:21.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe just explain a little
bit more of that specifically.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.909 align:middle line:84%
Why is that important
in this technique?

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:28.159 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's so important
not just in this technique,

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.389 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:34.469 align:middle line:84%
When we ask ourself, would
I choose to feel this way?

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Would I choose to
think this way?

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Would I choose what
I'm experiencing

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:42.409 align:middle line:84%
in my body, in my
marriage, in my business?

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And when it's painful, when
it's scary, when it's stressful,

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.989 align:middle line:90%
the answer's no.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:49.639 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't choose it.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I might say, you know, something
good will come from it.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.790 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the question.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.989 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
would you choose it?

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is really important
because when we're aware--

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're very aware when
we're observing the symptoms

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.230 align:middle line:90%
and stressors of our life--

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:04.220 align:middle line:90%
we are conscious.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.450 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:07.400 align:middle line:84%
When we're conscious,
we, as human beings,

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.740 align:middle line:84%
have something that's
extremely powerful.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And that is, when
we're conscious,

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.978 align:middle line:90%
we have the power to choose.

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:16.020 align:middle line:84%
So when we're aware of
something that, of course,

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.450 align:middle line:90%
we would never choose--

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.910 align:middle line:90%
hell no, I'd never choose this--

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.970 align:middle line:84%
what we're aware of is
not the active choosing

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:26.090 align:middle line:84%
part of ourself,
we've made contact

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.170 align:middle line:84%
with the reactive
program part of ourself.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:34.970 align:middle line:84%
We've bridged the gap to
the subconscious mind.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.890 align:middle line:90%
And now we've made contact.

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.140 align:middle line:90%
And now we can begin--

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:41.510 align:middle line:84%
as a result of answering
this truth question,

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:46.130 align:middle line:84%
we can begin to lead and
guide and nurture and support

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.240 align:middle line:90%
this part of ourself.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.850 align:middle line:84%
Rather than being driven
by our subconscious mind,

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:55.290 align:middle line:84%
we can influence it to be its
fullest and greatest potential.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:56.660 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:84%
We have a clip of Dr. Weissman
doing a Lifeline session

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.197 align:middle line:90%
on a client.

00:36:00.197 --> 00:36:02.030 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
the end of that session

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.020 align:middle line:84%
where he asks her
the truth question.

00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that you you've
got the split screen of worry

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.410 align:middle line:90%
and anger and happiness.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.915 align:middle line:84%
Because you choose
happiness, right?

00:36:14.915 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
But if you were given
the opportunity for you

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to create your life
a day, even a moment,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
would you ever choose to create
it feeling worried or angry,

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.310 align:middle line:84%
or having your knee even a 1
out of 10-- or your shoulder--

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:26.150 align:middle line:90%
would you choose that?

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.630 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.560 align:middle line:90%
>> The answer is hell no.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:28.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:28.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:29.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a chance.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a chance.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.138 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's cool about
this-- and this is education.

00:36:32.138 --> 00:36:34.040 align:middle line:84%
That was what we called
the truth question.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:84%
It helps us to
discern rather than

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.430 align:middle line:90%
judge ourselves or our life.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:42.230 align:middle line:84%
It helps us get into our heart,
be present in the moment,

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.580 align:middle line:90%
and go, wait a second.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.470 align:middle line:90%
That's a reactive part of me.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:49.300 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not actively choosing
it, I'm getting triggered

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:50.660 align:middle line:90%
and reacting.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And that's the subconscious.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the reactive mind.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.700 align:middle line:90%
It's the reactive body.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It's the reactive relationships.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's so cool is that that
reactive mind is programmed.

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And like a computer, you can
change the program of your mind

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.820 align:middle line:84%
and influence the
healing of your body,

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:12.710 align:middle line:84%
influence the
relationships of your life

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:17.060 align:middle line:84%
in a beautiful, awesome,
really life-affirming way.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Now it seems to me that
she probably went through some

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.060 align:middle line:90%
emotional shifts during this.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:84%
Is that a common thing,
an emotional reaction

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.630 align:middle line:90%
to the Lifeline Technique?

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, during
a Lifeline session--

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.540 align:middle line:84%
because it's very
benign and simple.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.770 align:middle line:90%
We're literally talking.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, there's
this moment in the Lifeline,

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.680 align:middle line:84%
where all of a sudden,
we see the truth.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.900 align:middle line:90%
And we're like, oh my goodness.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, the
emotions that come up

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.810 align:middle line:84%
are tears of gratitude, that
we see the ripple effect.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.530 align:middle line:84%
We see the domino of why
this has been emotion.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.620 align:middle line:84%
You know, sometimes, there's
emotions of sadness, of grief,

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.950 align:middle line:90%
of frustration.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.110 align:middle line:90%
There's no one way.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But emotions are
definitely natural.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.630 align:middle line:84%
One of the unique things,
and why I teach the Lifeline

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:12.590 align:middle line:84%
to anyone who's really a seeker
and desiring to have tools

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.030 align:middle line:84%
for themselves,
one of the reasons

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.240 align:middle line:84%
why I teach it to laypersons
is because people don't

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.850 align:middle line:90%
have what's called abreactions.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:23.870 align:middle line:84%
So an abreaction is where
people relive trauma.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.680 align:middle line:84%
People don't relive
trauma in the Lifeline.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.480 align:middle line:90%
They don't.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:33.080 align:middle line:84%
We might cry or, you know,
have an emotion where things

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.390 align:middle line:84%
are beginning to move in
them, that a lot of people go,

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know
why I'm crying.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:38.533 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I'm
feeling this way.

00:38:38.533 --> 00:38:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Just, things just start
to move just naturally.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:44.480 align:middle line:84%
But people don't
relive the traumas.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Like in certain
processes, like EMDR--

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.880 align:middle line:84%
eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing-- people

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.410 align:middle line:90%
can have a reaction in it.

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that's done
by a trained therapist,

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.040 align:middle line:90%
psychologist, or social worker.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mentioned the
desire that people have.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And I know that someone
has to have the desire

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.750 align:middle line:84%
to heal and to move through some
of what they're dealing with.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Does an intention help them?

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.320 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned something about
golden rules for an intention.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So where does setting
this intention really come

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.950 align:middle line:84%
in for somebody
who wants healing?

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:17.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, once you know what
you would never choose,

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:23.310 align:middle line:90%
now the fun part begins.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:27.100 align:middle line:84%
You know, here we are like,
hey, you don't have a choice.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.810 align:middle line:90%
This is going on in your body.

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:90%
This is going on in your life.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.550 align:middle line:90%
You did experience this.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.810 align:middle line:84%
The great news is, you have
a choice in how you respond.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And the two golden
rules are how to set

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.800 align:middle line:84%
intention to manifest
sustainable change,

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.880 align:middle line:84%
rather than just
short-term change.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And the first
golden rule is based

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.880 align:middle line:90%
upon what we focus on grows.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:84%
So we always focus
on where we're going.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
What fear does to us is fear
says, just make this go away.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Make the symptom,
make the disease,

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.190 align:middle line:90%
make the person just go away.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:03.270 align:middle line:90%
Then I can be happy.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Just avoid this.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Pretend it's not there.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:90%
That's what fear does.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And fear will never
create sustainable change.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:11.820 align:middle line:90%
Love says, this sucks.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.180 align:middle line:84%
However, I'm the
common denominator.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Of everything and everyone in
my life, and if I desire change,

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I've got to take responsibility
for exactly where I am.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And that responsibility
is the ability

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.550 align:middle line:84%
to respond in the
face of reaction.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
golden rule is, instead

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:32.455 align:middle line:84%
of looking in the rear view
mirror or the side view

00:40:32.455 --> 00:40:34.530 align:middle line:84%
mirrors, I'm looking
where I'm going.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:41.010 align:middle line:84%
My heart always knows
my next best step.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So setting intention
comes from the heart.

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from
one word, desire--

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.050 align:middle line:90%
not want, not need.

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Desire is a unique fuel
that enables someone to,

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.630 align:middle line:84%
like a rocket ship, to
go beyond the gravity

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.550 align:middle line:90%
of their current circumstances.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Desire will take them
beyond that gravity.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So we connect with our
heart and we literally

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:08.790 align:middle line:84%
ask, hey, heart, if you could
choose to feel anything--

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:10.920 align:middle line:90%
my best self, my highest self--

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.060 align:middle line:84%
what is it that
you desire to feel?

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.560 align:middle line:90%
And something comes through.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.360 align:middle line:90%
We feel it.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.470 align:middle line:84%
I desire to feel
calm and confident.

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:20.070 align:middle line:90%
Cool.

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:23.310 align:middle line:84%
The second golden rule is
because the brain and the body

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.250 align:middle line:84%
don't know the difference
in memory, reality,

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.970 align:middle line:84%
or imagination, we set our
intention as if we're already

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:34.680 align:middle line:84%
there, as if we've already
reached the summit, the highest

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:35.852 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:41:35.852 --> 00:41:37.560 align:middle line:84%
So if we were already
there, I could say,

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I am in front of what
my heart desires.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:42.270 align:middle line:90%
I am calm and confident.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:43.140 align:middle line:90%
And I say it.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:44.730 align:middle line:90%
I am calm and confident.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.018 align:middle line:90%
I am calm and confident.

00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:48.060 align:middle line:84%
This is the beginning of
leading the subconscious

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:90%
mind, the leader.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.260 align:middle line:84%
We finally got to why we're
here doing the Lifeline.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.468 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't because the cancer.

00:41:53.468 --> 00:41:55.302 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't because of
the autoimmune disease.

00:41:55.302 --> 00:41:57.520 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't because of the
anxiety and panic attacks.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It was because you're
getting ready to step

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.090 align:middle line:84%
into the next greatest
version of yourself, which

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.852 align:middle line:90%
is calm and confident.

00:42:04.852 --> 00:42:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>> You mentioned imagination.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.270 align:middle line:84%
What's the imagination's-- I
know it's not just some cute

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.080 align:middle line:84%
byproduct of consciousness
that allows industries like

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.370 align:middle line:90%
Hollywood to come about.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:15.830 align:middle line:84%
What is the power
of imagination?

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:17.372 align:middle line:84%
How do you employ
it in the Lifeline?

00:42:17.372 --> 00:42:22.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is a great
question because once we make

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.270 align:middle line:84%
our intention of I am
calm and confident,

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:26.820 align:middle line:84%
a part of ourself rationally
goes, well, that's BS.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:27.740 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:28.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm anxious.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm frustrated.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I get triggered by
what this happens.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So we must use our imagination
to take us to places

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.240 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't gone yet.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Imagination can take us beyond
this lens of misperception

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:42.780 align:middle line:84%
that we've been looking
through and help

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.580 align:middle line:84%
us to realize that there's
a whole other world.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:51.360 align:middle line:84%
So our imagination, what
it does is I imagine myself

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.920 align:middle line:84%
where my health, my
relationships, my behavior,

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.490 align:middle line:84%
my future is I am
calm and confident.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm seeing myself there.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.160 align:middle line:90%
And I'm observing it.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.202 align:middle line:90%
And I'm paying attention.

00:43:03.202 --> 00:43:06.210 align:middle line:84%
How does it feel in my body
to imagine myself being

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the
I'm-calm-and-confident-Darren?

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:middle line:90%
It feels flowing.

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.260 align:middle line:90%
I feel flowing.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:17.430 align:middle line:84%
That flowing feeling that I'm
feeling in my body right now,

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.590 align:middle line:90%
you know what that is?

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:20.520 align:middle line:90%
>> What's that?

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's medicine.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.960 align:middle line:84%
That flowing feeling
is a chemical reaction

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.960 align:middle line:84%
that's actually going
on inside of my body

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.240 align:middle line:84%
that gives me the
flowing feeling.

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sign that the
I-am-calm-and-confident-Darren

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.100 align:middle line:90%
already exists within me.

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be able to feel it.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So imagination is
what got us there.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:84%
>> What is a
conscious body portal?

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.280 align:middle line:84%
How can we use that to
tap into our healing?

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Now you're talking
about the game.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.180 align:middle line:84%
The Lifeline
Technique, it's a game.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's about playing the game.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.550 align:middle line:84%
How do I now, once I've got
my intention-- for example,

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm calm and confident,
feeling flowing.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.320 align:middle line:84%
Now that I have
that, now I purposely

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.970 align:middle line:84%
want to trigger the
subconscious mind.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Now I want to get it to react.

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Because if I can get
the subconscious mind

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.410 align:middle line:84%
to react with a
conscious body portal,

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:14.380 align:middle line:84%
if I can get it to react
where it no longer reacts,

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.710 align:middle line:84%
then I've changed the
physiology of the body.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:20.440 align:middle line:84%
If I can use
particular portals--

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:84%
and the conscious body
portal is one portal--

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:27.860 align:middle line:84%
of observing the body and
the symptoms with intention,

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:33.490 align:middle line:84%
then I can shift and activate
what is inherent in all of us,

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:37.390 align:middle line:84%
self-healing,
regeneration, wholeness.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful.

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.100 align:middle line:84%
In Dr. Weissman's
trainings, he teaches people

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.130 align:middle line:84%
how to use these body portals
to connect their bodies, minds,

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.060 align:middle line:90%
and spirits.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:52.048 align:middle line:10%
>> Together, I'd like to
repeat, my spirit's pure love.

00:44:52.048 --> 00:44:53.590 align:middle line:10%
>> (IN UNISON) My
spirit's pure love.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:55.330 align:middle line:10%
>> We put it right at the crown.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.310 align:middle line:10%
There it is, right?

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:58.480 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Spirit's pure love.

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And take it away and
then put it back.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.390 align:middle line:90%
And just feel.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:05.800 align:middle line:90%
Touch it and feel.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.320 align:middle line:84%
See if you notice how it feels
to have the hand on there

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.120 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.700 align:middle line:90%


00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Some people are very
sensitive with energy.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Others are gaining
their sensitivity.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:21.850 align:middle line:84%
But just by touching it, you've
just opened up a new screen

00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.100 align:middle line:90%
just like that.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.146 align:middle line:84%
The mind, take it, put
it over the forehead.

00:45:28.146 --> 00:45:31.000 align:middle line:10%
I invite you to repeat,
my mind is infinite.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.920 align:middle line:10%
>> (IN UNISON) My
mind is infinite.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.740 align:middle line:10%
>> Right?

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.890 align:middle line:10%
Just touching it,
the mind's infinite.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:38.360 align:middle line:90%
This is the body point.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.910 align:middle line:84%
I love your posture
right over the heart.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.824 align:middle line:10%
I invite you to repeat, my
body is designed to heal.

00:45:43.824 --> 00:45:45.750 align:middle line:10%
>> (IN UNISON) My body
is designed to heal.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So just by putting
your hand over here,

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.260 align:middle line:84%
you're activating the
self-healing and regenerating

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.635 align:middle line:90%
energy of your body.

00:45:52.635 --> 00:45:54.260 align:middle line:84%
How do you think I'm
sleeping at night?

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.190 align:middle line:84%
I got my hand over
my heart, right?

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Infinite love and gratitude.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.470 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to do
the spirit to the body.

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So when we go spirit to body, it
means we touch the spirit first

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.500 align:middle line:84%
and then we touch the
body point second.

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.648 align:middle line:84%
And I invite to repeat
infinite love and gratitude.

00:46:11.648 --> 00:46:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> (IN UNISON) Infinite
love and gratitude.

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:18.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we keep the hand on the
body, lift up the crown point,

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.190 align:middle line:90%
place it back.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.333 align:middle line:10%
Now we're harmonizing
the body with the spirit.

00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:22.500 align:middle line:90%
Infinite love and gratitude.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> (IN UNISON) Infinite
love and gratitude.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we want to unify the
spirit embodying the present

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:28.090 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.173 align:middle line:84%
Take them away at the same time,
touch them at the same time.

00:46:31.173 --> 00:46:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Infinite love and gratitude.

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.132 align:middle line:84%
>> (IN UNISON) Infinite
love and gratitude.

00:46:34.132 --> 00:46:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Take a breath.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.040 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.680 align:middle line:90%
We have props here.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted you to just kind
of show us what you brought

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.350 align:middle line:84%
and how this fits into the
work that you're doing.

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:46.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:46:46.395 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a
portal that we use,

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.490 align:middle line:84%
it's called the core
limiting belief portal.

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And the core limiting
belief portal

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:57.770 align:middle line:84%
uses senses so that we can
trigger the subconscious mind

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:00.920 align:middle line:90%
to create a reactive pattern.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:84%
In life, we don't
perceive truth.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.490 align:middle line:90%
We perceive what we believe.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.790 align:middle line:84%
So when we have these
core limiting beliefs

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.500 align:middle line:84%
that live in our
subconscious mind,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.050 align:middle line:84%
they get triggered by
colors, sounds, smells,

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:13.440 align:middle line:90%
taste, feelings.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:18.530 align:middle line:84%
So I use muscle testing;
first, second, third, fourth.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's a core
limiting belief

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:23.520 align:middle line:84%
in the power center
of the heart.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.320 align:middle line:90%
It's about feeling.

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It's about self-love.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.920 align:middle line:84%
So I'd have somebody
put these on.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.380 align:middle line:90%
And I can put them on myself.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:33.680 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as my eyes are
perceiving the color green,

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the protein receptors-- the
rods and cones in my eyes--

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.690 align:middle line:84%
as soon as they are,
the muscle gives way.

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:41.360 align:middle line:84%
When I put these up
here, I check the muscle,

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.010 align:middle line:90%
locks out, strong as can be.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.200 align:middle line:90%
As soon as I put them on, boom.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.490 align:middle line:90%
It gives way.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is a concept
that's called epigenetics.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And this means that
we're not predetermined

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:57.410 align:middle line:84%
by our genes, that we can
actually activate and switch

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.440 align:middle line:84%
on our genes as we're
processing our emotions.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is a process
where we touch hair

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and we go, infinite
love and gratitude.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.410 align:middle line:90%
Infinite love and gratitude.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So now when I am looking
through the color green,

00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm no longer triggered.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm no longer triggered.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Now this could be an essential
oil that I'm smelling.

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Or it could be a tuning fork
that we activate the sound.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.030 align:middle line:84%
This is about
activating our senses,

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:31.820 align:middle line:84%
so that rather than being
the reactive person,

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:35.930 align:middle line:84%
that I can be in the eye
of the storm and be calm.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is a unique
portal that uses senses

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:45.260 align:middle line:84%
so that our internal body is
reacting to what's going on,

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.893 align:middle line:84%
rather than reacting
to beliefs in our mind.

00:48:47.893 --> 00:48:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we don't
perceive truth,

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:50.820 align:middle line:90%
we perceive what we believe.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So if there's a limiting belief,
then my liver is reacting

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:56.630 align:middle line:84%
not based upon what's
going on in the world,

00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:00.000 align:middle line:84%
my liver's reacting to a belief
that I'm not good enough,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.020 align:middle line:84%
or that it's not safe to speak,
or that no one can be trusted.

00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it might
be, there's all kinds

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.760 align:middle line:84%
of beliefs that
affect our perception.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And we can change
those limiting beliefs

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:14.790 align:middle line:84%
into an infinite
potential through these.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, the ability to use some
of these tools and even be able

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:22.880 align:middle line:84%
to kind of, like, decode
what does that even mean,

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:26.750 align:middle line:84%
how long did it take you to
integrate this into the whole

00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:28.730 align:middle line:90%
Lifeline Technique?

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:33.857 align:middle line:84%
>> I woke up to it June
17, 2002 at 8:30 at night.

00:49:33.857 --> 00:49:34.940 align:middle line:90%
>> So that was the moment.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:35.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Boom.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.690 align:middle line:90%
It all came together.

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:41.330 align:middle line:84%
I had been studying
my whole life.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.540 align:middle line:84%
I had been a passionate seeker
and experiencer of life.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that there
was something within me.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to make a positive
difference that started

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.150 align:middle line:90%
with me and my own struggles.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:57.800 align:middle line:84%
So as far as someone
learning how to do this,

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.770 align:middle line:84%
usually, people go through a
yearlong process in learning

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:90%
the Lifeline Technique.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I've had people
learn it in 32 days.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:07.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's a
unique person, right?

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:08.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's different
for different people.

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you feel there's
a future of, like,

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.580 align:middle line:84%
consistently
including other tools?

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, one thing that I've
always been very interested in

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:21.080 align:middle line:84%
is anything having to do
with shamanic practices.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, they don't have to
be psychedelic plants,

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:84%
but the use of plant
teachers and these as tools,

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:31.850 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes doing art and
color therapy in those ways.

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you have any
inkling that this

00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:37.370 align:middle line:84%
is going to grow and
keep becoming inclusive?

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It already is.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:40.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's design is that.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:44.540 align:middle line:84%
This is a compilation of 14
plus systems all integrated

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.100 align:middle line:90%
into one.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But let's take an example
for somebody who comes on in,

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.120 align:middle line:84%
and let's say,
they've been diagnosed

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.360 align:middle line:90%
with a real serious disease.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.470 align:middle line:84%
I always tell people, get
your dream team together.

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So whether it be
you've got somebody

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.835 align:middle line:84%
that is a western
medical doctor,

00:51:01.835 --> 00:51:03.710 align:middle line:84%
or whether it be someone
who's a nutritionist

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.340 align:middle line:84%
or an acupuncturist or using
plant medicine or shamanism,

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:10.580 align:middle line:84%
the nature of what we'll be
doing within the Lifeline

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.730 align:middle line:84%
as far as being a part
of your dream team

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:16.300 align:middle line:84%
is we're going to be working
on a subconscious level.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And that part of the dream
team is very important.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So there's all
kinds of tools that

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.370 align:middle line:84%
integrate into this
puzzle of life that is

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.500 align:middle line:90%
very important for all of us.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And the Lifeline
integrates seamlessly

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.400 align:middle line:84%
in a real empowering,
inclusive way.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Weissman has
taught thousands

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:37.630 align:middle line:84%
of people on how
to do the Lifeline

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:40.790 align:middle line:84%
Technique not only on
themselves, but also on others.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And here is what
one of his students

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:44.860 align:middle line:84%
experienced as a result of
going through this training.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:46.840 align:middle line:90%
Let's check this out.

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> They did all the tests and
they came back and said, well,

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:53.320 align:middle line:90%
Jerry's had a bilateral stroke.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, wheel
a cot into his room

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.190 align:middle line:90%
because I'm not leaving.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And so for the next,
it was probably

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.260 align:middle line:84%
about 22 hours, every
45 minutes or so,

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:05.800 align:middle line:84%
I would get up and
do a Lifeline on him.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.050 align:middle line:84%
If he was awake,
he would be present

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.190 align:middle line:90%
with me doing the Lifeline.

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:11.890 align:middle line:84%
If he wasn't, I would use
myself as a surrogate.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:16.360 align:middle line:84%
And every time he
moved or made a noise,

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.760 align:middle line:84%
I got up and did
a Lifeline on him.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.620 align:middle line:84%
The next day, the doctor came in
with an occupational therapist.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And the occupational therapist
said, raise your arm up, dear.

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.770 align:middle line:84%
He was paralyzed
on the left side

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.790 align:middle line:84%
because the stroke was
worse on the right side

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.680 align:middle line:90%
than the left side.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.030 align:middle line:90%
And he said, well, I can't.

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.310 align:middle line:90%
I said, well, sure you can.

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:36.110 align:middle line:90%
Lift your arm.

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:37.900 align:middle line:90%
And so his arm went straight up.

00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.688 align:middle line:90%
And he was surprised.

00:52:39.688 --> 00:52:40.730 align:middle line:90%
The doctor was surprised.

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:44.180 align:middle line:84%
So the occupational therapist
took him out in the hall,

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.580 align:middle line:84%
had him walk up
and down the hall

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:47.562 align:middle line:84%
frontwards, backwards,
sideways, every way,

00:52:47.562 --> 00:52:48.520 align:middle line:90%
up and down the stairs.

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.650 align:middle line:90%
And she said, you don't need me.

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, I
don't know what happened.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And he was released from
the hospital in four days.

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And in one month, he was
given approval to drive.

00:52:59.890 --> 00:53:04.482 align:middle line:84%
So I know without a doubt that
that was because of the work

00:53:04.482 --> 00:53:06.940 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from Dr. Darren
Weissman called the Lifeline

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.990 align:middle line:90%
Technique.

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so grateful for it.

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:15.340 align:middle line:84%
So that was about a
year and a half ago.

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.793 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was a
big shock to the system.

00:53:18.793 --> 00:53:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So he lost a lot of
weight and it took a while

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:21.850 align:middle line:90%
to get his strength back.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.760 align:middle line:84%
But you would never know
that anything happened.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And again, I'm so
grateful for the work.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, I had
been a Lifeline practitioner

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:32.920 align:middle line:90%
for four years.

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:38.290 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, the doctors
were asking me for my card.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:41.810 align:middle line:84%
The neurologists, when we
went for the checkup, he said,

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:90%
do you want to come work for me?

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.070 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:46.153 align:middle line:90%
But I would love to teach.

00:53:46.153 --> 00:53:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So it's been an
incredible journey.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:52.690 align:middle line:84%
And while I would not wish
that on myself or anyone,

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:57.160 align:middle line:84%
it gave me the confidence
and competent factor.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I know what I know, and I
know what the Lifeline can do.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.010 align:middle line:90%
There's no doubt in my mind.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen miracle, after
miracle, after miracle happen.

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Powerful.

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:11.420 align:middle line:84%
You know, not much that can
even be said about that.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.633 align:middle line:84%
But you see the
emotion on her face.

00:54:13.633 --> 00:54:14.800 align:middle line:90%
How does that make you feel?

00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.540 align:middle line:84%
You're touching people's lives
so deeply with this technique.

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm so moved.

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.020 align:middle line:90%


00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:28.230 align:middle line:84%
I'm just beyond
blessed and grateful.

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I found my life purpose.

00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:37.960 align:middle line:84%
In a moment of fear meeting
faith, I found why I'm here.

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's powerful,
and I can feel that.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:44.020 align:middle line:84%
And I can also feel how much
that even means to you as well.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.940 align:middle line:84%
If we were to look forward
in the next 10, 15,

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:50.830 align:middle line:84%
20 years, or just the
rest of your life,

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:52.960 align:middle line:84%
if you had to boil it
down and distill it,

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:55.930 align:middle line:84%
what are you looking as
the big accomplishment?

00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:57.250 align:middle line:90%
What's the big impact?

00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Whether it has to do
specifically with the Lifeline

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Technique or beyond that,
what's the splash and the mark

00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:05.320 align:middle line:84%
you'd like to make
on this world?

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.002 align:middle line:84%
>> The vision is world
peace through inner peace.

00:55:08.002 --> 00:55:09.460 align:middle line:84%
>> World peace
through inner peace.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:10.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:12.520 align:middle line:84%
Once one person
knows that they can

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:17.440 align:middle line:84%
move through their own
emotions, that they can discover

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.173 align:middle line:84%
an inner calm, a confidence,
that they can get up

00:55:21.173 --> 00:55:22.840 align:middle line:84%
after they've been
knocked down and they

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.890 align:middle line:84%
can replicate that and do
that, then anyone can--

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:27.730 align:middle line:90%
then anyone can.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So, you know, my
vision in the future

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.860 align:middle line:84%
is that we live in a beautiful,
beautiful world, where people

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:39.040 align:middle line:84%
are themselves
authentically, and kind

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and curious and
compassionate and passionate

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:44.860 align:middle line:84%
and loving to themselves
and each other.

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>> What's the first step?

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.580 align:middle line:84%
There are people that, let's
say, in their own minds,

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:52.900 align:middle line:84%
they haven't even stepped
onto the path towards healing,

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:56.717 align:middle line:84%
towards the fullest
potential of themselves.

00:55:56.717 --> 00:55:58.300 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe
is the first step?

00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The first step is just
being open to change,

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:03.840 align:middle line:90%
just being open to change.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Because the subconscious
mind never changes.

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to come up
with all kinds of excuses

00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and reasons of why I can't, why
I won't, why other people can

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.380 align:middle line:90%
but not me.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.960 align:middle line:84%
The first thing is to
go, I'm open to change.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And then begin the journey of
creating a loving relationship

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.960 align:middle line:90%
with your subconscious mind.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.330 align:middle line:84%
If it's as simple
as literally taking

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:29.938 align:middle line:84%
your hand in this
mudra of I love you,

00:56:29.938 --> 00:56:31.230 align:middle line:90%
and placing it over your heart.

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And when you're feeling
anxious or worried,

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.550 align:middle line:84%
or when you're thinking
about your own dreams

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:38.220 align:middle line:84%
for your own life, infinite
love and gratitude.

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And just use that and
notice what happens.

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:45.180 align:middle line:84%
The beauty is the entire
lifeline is about this.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.620 align:middle line:10%
But like the snowflakes,
there is intricacies and steps

00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:52.770 align:middle line:10%
and different levels and
dimensions of the subconscious

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:59.580 align:middle line:10%
mind that, to access them,
there are unique tools that we

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.470 align:middle line:10%
use to enable it to happen.

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:04.173 align:middle line:90%
So where do I start?

00:57:04.173 --> 00:57:05.340 align:middle line:90%
Infinite love and gratitude.

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just open to change and
into being curious and learning

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.210 align:middle line:84%
more about myself,
and going inward.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:14.520 align:middle line:84%
And that it's not a
problem, that it's

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.905 align:middle line:84%
a portal to the next
greatest version of myself.

00:57:18.905 --> 00:57:21.030 align:middle line:84%
>> How do people get in
touch with you if they want

00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:24.180 align:middle line:84%

Technique and start to open up

these portals to the next
greatest version of themselves?

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.130 align:middle line:90%
How do people connect with you?

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:34.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Through our website, which

>> Dr. Weissman has shared with
us a very powerful way that

and minds as doorways to access
the true healing potential

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.200 align:middle line:10%

more balance and purpose
