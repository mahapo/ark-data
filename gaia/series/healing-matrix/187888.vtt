00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.190 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. SUE MORTER: Did you know
that inside our own bodies

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.700 align:middle line:10%
exists an entire universe
teeming with life, including

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.110 align:middle line:10%
bacteria, viruses, fungi.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.510 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:90%
We need them.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Our hormones, mood, cognitive
function, and healing potential

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.700 align:middle line:84%
depends on the health
of our microbiome.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Grace Liu, also known as the
Gut Goddess, is here to tell us

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.520 align:middle line:84%
how our physical
and mental health

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:84%
can be understood by looking
at the delicate balance

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.180 align:middle line:90%
of microorganisms in our gut.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.190 align:middle line:10%
And I know that you have
a personal story that

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.040 align:middle line:10%
got you interested in this
trajectory of becoming

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.865 align:middle line:10%
a clinician.

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:90%
Maybe we could start there?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.428 align:middle line:84%
>>DR. GRACE LIU:
I would love to.

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:10%
Little did I know when I
went to pharmacy school,

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:10%
and studied traditional
conventional medicine

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.960 align:middle line:10%
in pharmacy school,
that our microbiome

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.600 align:middle line:10%
and their metabolites--
the chemicals they emit--

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.640 align:middle line:10%
actually are like a pharmacy.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.305 align:middle line:10%
They are healing, and instead
of pharmaceuticals, they

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:10%
actually get to the
root issue and even

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:10%
reverse damage and disease.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.220 align:middle line:10%
So when I grew up actually,
my little sisters and I,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.148 align:middle line:10%
we lost our mom to a
tragic fatal car accident.

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And it really changed
our trajectory.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.000 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize how
the trauma actually,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:84%
until one of my shaman
last year, I work with,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.590 align:middle line:84%
mentioned this is the
biggest trauma anyone could

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:90%
have before age 15.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.120 align:middle line:90%
It really shaped a lot.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And after 20 years of
conventional medicine

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:84%
as a pharmacist, I actually
had my own health crisis.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.330 align:middle line:90%
Too many antibiotics.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:84%
My dad actually is a surgeon, so
every sniffle, fever, and cough

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
we had, we got
treated really well.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was great.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:84%
But back then, my dad
didn't know either

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.470 align:middle line:84%
that the microbiome
was so important.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.590 align:middle line:84%
It's literally half
of our body cells.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.050 align:middle line:84%
If we consider them as
a organ, a silent organ,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
they're literally half of
us, the number of cells.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So the things
that antibiotics affect

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.460 align:middle line:90%
include half of who we are?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Exactly.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And that's a lot.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.802 align:middle line:90%
It's a huge--

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:19.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's tremendous.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.450 align:middle line:90%
The first count was wrong.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.867 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and that now
that scientists

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:24.465 align:middle line:84%
are counting every
cell of our human body,

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.340 align:middle line:84%
including red blood
cells, white blood cells,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.430 align:middle line:90%
and they're literally 1 to 1.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And through evolutionary time,
if people believe in evolution,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.040 align:middle line:84%
we've had this other
half the entire time.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.570 align:middle line:90%
They break down food for us.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
They keep us healthy, strong,
and happy, feeling whole.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing we can't do
better with them on our side,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:90%
as allies.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.170 align:middle line:90%
So little did I know--

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
every sniffle, fever, cough,
despite feeling a little better

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
on antibiotics,
little did we know

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.420 align:middle line:84%
that actually losing and
depleting that other half,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:84%
that microbiome,
would make us more

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
vulnerable for another
cold, another infection,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
another cough, sniffle,
cold, bronchitis, asthma,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.560 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.378 align:middle line:84%
Medicine just does
its best, right?

00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But we're so fortunate
and lucky now,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:84%
we have a whole field of
microbiome research now

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.690 align:middle line:84%
that backs up a lot of things
we do in integrative medicine.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
So I had my own health
crisis, but then

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
what was really important,
some of my best friends

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:90%
had their health crises.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.950 align:middle line:84%
Two of my best friends, they
developed not just one cancer,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.760 align:middle line:90%
but two cancers.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.802 align:middle line:90%
And they were very young.

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:31.280 align:middle line:84%
We were in our 40s, and both
actually had little children.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
One had worked really
hard to have twins

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.880 align:middle line:90%
on in vitro fertilization.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.270 align:middle line:84%
She not only was diagnosed
with breast cancer and ovarian,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
she developed two cancers
at a very, very young age.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.840 align:middle line:84%
My other best friend developed
a breast lump and melanoma.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.025 align:middle line:84%
And their lives were
really threatened.

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was threatened with
losing my best friends, my best

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.390 align:middle line:90%
girlfriends.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And it really made me look at
what conventional medicine is

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.240 align:middle line:84%
doing in our diet, and
our modern living, all

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.123 align:middle line:84%
the antibiotics,
and it made sense.

00:03:59.123 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
I made a shift directly
to functional medicine

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:90%
after my own health crisis.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And after losing my mom, and
learning from one of the shaman

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I worked with last
year, that losing

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:84%
a parent at such a
young age, below age 15,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.800 align:middle line:84%
is one of the major
traumas someone

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.095 align:middle line:90%
could have in their life.

00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:14.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: I had no idea.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: And here,
my best friends

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
were threatened for their
kids for the same thing.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And one of my missions in
working with families, or moms

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and dads, or anyone even
with a fur family, (LAUGHS)

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
is to prevent an early premature
death due to modern dysbiosis,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.650 align:middle line:90%
modern damage.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:90%
We can prevent all this.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary at all.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.670 align:middle line:84%
And through our gut protocols
now, with microbiome medicine,

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:84%
we've seen a lot of people
have great energy endurance,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.260 align:middle line:84%
and all their cancer
markers go down.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
So we can prevent
so many things.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What was
the health crisis

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:84%
that you were
experiencing that really

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.268 align:middle line:90%
got your attention in this way?

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:55.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It was through
pharmaceuticals actually,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.350 align:middle line:90%
a modern intervention.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So we come from a family
of very fertile women.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:84%
My sisters and I
are super fertile.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I had two children
already, and wanted

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:90%
to prevent some fertility--

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.662 align:middle line:90%
too much fertility for our case.

00:05:11.662 --> 00:05:12.870 align:middle line:90%
We were lucky in that regard.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So I had a Mirena IUD,
an intrauterine device

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.378 align:middle line:90%
which emits hormones.

00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And in this modern
day, we have a lot

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:84%
of xenoestrogens, which are
toxic chemicals like plastics,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.868 align:middle line:90%
thalates, flame retardants.

00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
They cause estrogenic
effects on people's bodies.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, the device I had, it's
a hormone drug that reduces

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
fertility-- it's
a birth control--

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's a xenoprogestin.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:84%
So I had actually
toxicity of progestin.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And it affected all
my organ systems.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
I had immune deficiency,
major gut issues.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
All birth control is associated
with gut dysbiosis-- leaky gut,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
hyperpermeability of the gut,
gut problems, B12, and other B

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.650 align:middle line:84%
vitamin, and other
vitamin deficiencies, zinc

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.020 align:middle line:90%
deficiencies.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And I had it in a
really major way.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps my genetics
and ancestry aren't

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:90%
adapted for hormone imbalances.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And then I had, of
course, antibiotics.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I had a dental implant put in
that I probably didn't need.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.370 align:middle line:84%
It was a foreign
object, which ends up

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
being a magnet for
pathogens if you

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:84%
don't have a great gut
microbiome or the mouth

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.460 align:middle line:90%
bacteria that live there.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.985 align:middle line:84%
So I had incredible
fatigue for eight years.

00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:90%
No one could figure it out.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
I actually worked
with some of the best

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.060 align:middle line:90%
in functional medicine.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.143 align:middle line:90%
They really all helped me.

00:06:24.143 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Really great, but to
get to the root issue

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
was a little tougher,
because I had

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.440 align:middle line:90%
just so many things going on.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Like the perfect storm.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Couple all of this on top of the
fact that you lost your mother,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.740 align:middle line:84%
and then shuts down our
emotional centers, which

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.990 align:middle line:90%
happens to be in the gut also.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.407 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Happens
to be in the gut.

00:06:42.407 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so, the
energies combined

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.920 align:middle line:84%
with all the
antibiotic therapies

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
that you were being handed with
all the best of intentions.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.980 align:middle line:84%
You've said that we've had to
pay a price for these advances

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.230 align:middle line:90%
in Western medicine.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Can you say a little
bit more about that?

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: That's
exactly right, Dr. Sue.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
In this modern day and age, we
don't get massive infections

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%
and die.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:84%
At one point actually I had a
third-degree burn on my leg.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.315 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really grateful
I had steroids,

00:07:06.315 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:84%
and IV antibiotics
that prevented me

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:84%
from having infection
and my leg cut off.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Maybe another day my leg would
have been cut off actually.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have plagues, we
don't have wild rampant TB,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:90%
or other wild infections.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And our water is
clean, and sanitized.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.484 align:middle line:84%
We don't have dysentery
all day, every day,

00:07:27.484 --> 00:07:29.609 align:middle line:84%
like some third-world
countries because they're not

00:07:29.609 --> 00:07:29.740 align:middle line:90%
looking at data.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, we're blessed.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:31.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
On the flip side, now
we have other diseases

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:90%
that afflict all of us.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.110 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.777 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Lot of brain
fog, a lot of body

00:07:37.777 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
fat issues, composition,
metabolic syndrome,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
cardiovascular disease,
strokes, heart attacks, cancers,

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.470 align:middle line:84%
other kinds of
inflammatory diseases.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:51.057 align:middle line:84%
It's so funny, my parents
and all my extended family--

00:07:51.057 --> 00:07:52.640 align:middle line:84%
aunts, uncles,
grandparents-- they all

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
live very long lives
to 90, even 100,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:84%
with very little
chronic conditions.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:84%
But my sisters, and I,
and my little brother,

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.840 align:middle line:84%
we all developed an
autoimmune disease very young.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And knowing now what
microbiome medicine is about,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.210 align:middle line:84%
and the role of the
microbiome, our other half,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:84%
in protecting against
chronic diseases,

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.910 align:middle line:84%
we understand that those
antibiotics likely set up

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:90%
a pathway for these conditions.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, they not
only kill the bad bugs,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.510 align:middle line:84%
they take out some
of the good bugs.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And the next thing
you know, we have

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.030 align:middle line:84%
none of this family of
organisms that are attempting

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
to transmute, and
translate, and receive

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:84%
benefits, receive our
nutrients, and help us

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.409 align:middle line:90%
get rid of what we don't need.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:34.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Precisely.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: All of this
is just cut away

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:90%
with the best of intentions.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.169 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so, we
end up with a culture

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.787 align:middle line:90%
that is compromised in the gut.

00:08:43.787 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Interesting, I've never
taken an antibiotic.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.930 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a natural
health care environment.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, we come from these
opposite ends of the spectrum,

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:84%
and here we are today
having a conversation

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:90%
bringing it all together.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.630 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so much
for your perspective,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.520 align:middle line:84%
because it is so
helpful for people

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that while a little
bit of a good thing is good,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.100 align:middle line:84%
too much of a good
thing is not so good.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.530 align:middle line:10%
And now, we have to turn our
attention regarding our health

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:middle line:10%
care in a different direction.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.750 align:middle line:84%
So what's your experience
with Western cultures

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.783 align:middle line:84%
and the health of their gut,
versus non-Western cultures

00:09:14.783 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:90%
and the health of their gut?

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.540 align:middle line:10%
Is there research,
or do you have

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.960 align:middle line:10%
data on that, how we compare
to the rest of the world?

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Absolutely.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.633 align:middle line:90%
It's so fascinating.

00:09:22.633 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:84%
Here in the Western
world, studies

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.540 align:middle line:84%
are showing even after
one course of antibiotics,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.000 align:middle line:84%
we are losing and depleting
such a great amount

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
of our microbiome, we
literally can lose 1/3 or 2/3

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
of our whole microbiome with
even one course of antibiotics.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And it never reverts
back for some people.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Not everybody.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.757 align:middle line:84%
And then microbiome studies
are showing in Amish--

00:09:42.757 --> 00:09:44.840 align:middle line:84%
people in US, who have
more of a rural background.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.048 align:middle line:90%
They live with their animals.

00:09:46.048 --> 00:09:47.652 align:middle line:84%
They're very close
with their animals,

00:09:47.652 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have
antibiotics or health care.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:84%
And centenarians people
who live to over 100.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.940 align:middle line:90%
The Blue Zone areas--

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you and your audience
are really familiar with them

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.930 align:middle line:90%
through National Geographic.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Many of them can
eat anything they

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
want-- gluten, dairy, anything.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.560 align:middle line:84%
They live healthy long
lives to over 100,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.910 align:middle line:84%
with chronic disease-free
cancer-free lives,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.122 align:middle line:84%
and they have literally
no antibiotics.

00:10:09.122 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
When they look at
their microbiome,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.750 align:middle line:90%
they're fully intact.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Same with hunter gatherers
all over Africa, Malawi,

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:20.380 align:middle line:84%
rainforests, their
microbiome is very diverse.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And they have species
that we don't see anymore,

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
that are literally extinct
in the Western world.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's so fascinating to
compare these individuals

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and groups, and see
how healthy they are.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.862 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
individuals smoke, right?

00:10:36.862 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:90%
Even overweight a little bit.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.580 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.540 align:middle line:90%
They're super healthy.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.582 align:middle line:90%
They don't have diabetes.

00:10:40.582 --> 00:10:42.900 align:middle line:84%
They don't have any chronic
afflictions like we do.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So the way I look
at the microbiome,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:90%
it's of like a wealth portfolio.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Here in the Western world,
we're bankrupt in terms

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:90%
of our microbiome.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, yet these cultures
have little health care--

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.780 align:middle line:84%
probably very high infant
mortality and maternal

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.410 align:middle line:84%
mortality through childbirth--
but on the other side,

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.160 align:middle line:84%
they're very healthy and
have a disease-free life.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.700 align:middle line:84%
They're very happy, generally
speaking, and feel whole.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And they have great
diversity, lots

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.280 align:middle line:84%
of assets in their
gut microbiome,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:90%
and little liabilities.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: An excellent portfolio.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.580 align:middle line:90%
What everyone is looking for.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, and
you've had that.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.210 align:middle line:90%
You're so lucky.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:90%
It's rare.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:16.872 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:16.872 --> 00:11:18.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Well, and
we're also looking

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.010 align:middle line:84%
at the mind-body relationship
in the work that I do.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.450 align:middle line:10%
And what you're sharing
with this big crisis

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.570 align:middle line:10%
in your early life,
of losing your mother,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.300 align:middle line:10%
it makes perfect sense
that the idea of self-love

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.245 align:middle line:10%
isn't present because that
nurturing presence isn't there,

00:11:33.245 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:10%
and the next thing
you know, it's

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.600 align:middle line:10%
translating chemically
inside of our systems

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.850 align:middle line:10%
in a compromising way as well.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.017 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: There's multiple
factors, Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:40.017 --> 00:11:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how wonderful
that you're here.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
You're not only
surviving, you're

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.560 align:middle line:84%
thriving because you're turning
your attention onto what

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.830 align:middle line:84%
matters most, and sharing
it with other people.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're so grateful
to have you here.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.040 align:middle line:84%
Who are the clients
that come to you?

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.860 align:middle line:84%
Who is it that you end
up connecting with?

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.300 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: We have such a
great fanhood out there.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I work with really smart
moms, multitasking moms.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I work with executives
and endurance athletes,

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.850 align:middle line:90%
particularly MMA fighters also.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:84%
I help with the
supplement programs.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.440 align:middle line:84%
We help reduce body fat, brain
fog, and fatigue in six months

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.640 align:middle line:90%
or less.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: And how do you do that?

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.990 align:middle line:90%
What do you go about doing?

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.407 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: When
people work with us,

00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:20.820 align:middle line:84%
we have some precise protocols,
and we go through four phases.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.410 align:middle line:90%
And it's a lengthy program--

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:90%
six to eight months minimum.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:90%
And we do testing.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Everything is evidence-based.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.800 align:middle line:90%
And I teach.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
I teach a 50-hour gut
certification program

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:90%
for coaches and clinicians.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Through the four phases,
we look at what's

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.370 align:middle line:90%
in the gut and the microbiome.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:84%
We compare the assets
and the liabilities.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.730 align:middle line:84%
We help people who have
bankruptcy or gut debt

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.170 align:middle line:90%
and lot of liabilities.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.343 align:middle line:84%
We reduce those for them, and
then we build in diversity.

00:12:46.343 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
Just like a wealth
portfolio would

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.310 align:middle line:84%
have bonds, and stocks,
and real estate,

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of diverse assets,
dividend-building assets,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.040 align:middle line:90%
we help to build that back in.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
The species and
genera that we know

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
are really healthy
in the other half.

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.100 align:middle line:84%
If it's depleted
1/3 or 2/3 we start

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.860 align:middle line:84%
to rebuild all that
on a good foundation.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Rebuilding?

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Rebuilding
the microbiome

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and bringing back species, and
feeding them, anchoring them,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:84%
so that they can keep working
for the person and the host.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I learned pharmacy, and
I taught in pharmacy,

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't realize
when learning

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:28.332 align:middle line:84%
the conventional medicine route
of learning, I had no idea--

00:13:28.332 --> 00:13:30.540 align:middle line:84%
and neither did none of my
doctor friends or pharmacy

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:84%
friends-- realized that
our microbiome, our poop,

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
literally nourishes
and feeds us.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And unlike a pharmaceutical,
it doesn't just

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
put a Band-Aid on a symptom or
sign, it actually reverses it,

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:84%
to the degree where the
disease and damage disappear

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.770 align:middle line:90%
completely.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And this is from our
microbiome, our other half,

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.370 align:middle line:84%
they make these metabolites
and chemicals that are healing,

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.390 align:middle line:84%
protective for us, and keep
all the pathogens at bay

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.760 align:middle line:84%
so they don't invade, and
get into our bloodstream,

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and do damage, and
things like that.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.260 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so, then you
find this deficiency,

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:84%
or an imbalance in
their portfolio,

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:84%
you see that they're weighted
way too much on this,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:84%
and not enough in
this department.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Right.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.710 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And you then
deliver the solution how?

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: We have the protocol.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.920 align:middle line:84%
So some clients come to us,
they are leaders in their field,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
they are proponents and
advocates of a certain diet.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Even with a perfect diet,
they still can come to us

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
and their portfolio's
completely off.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
You can't resurrect
what's not there.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So we have to regain
and rebuild what's

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.150 align:middle line:84%
missing with the
protocols, and introduced

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.262 align:middle line:84%
species and genera
that are missing

00:14:35.262 --> 00:14:36.720 align:middle line:84%
or at very, very
low counts, and we

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:84%
help to resurrect
them, in other words.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And what we end up
seeing in just two

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.088 align:middle line:84%
or three months or less,
people feel amazing.

00:14:44.088 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Some clients of ours, they've
had fatigue for literally

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.810 align:middle line:84%
decades, and they didn't realize
they had so many issues that

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:49.860 align:middle line:90%
was related to their gut.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.237 align:middle line:84%
They had 10, 20, 30
rounds of antibiotics.

00:14:52.237 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:90%
They didn't realize.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.460 align:middle line:90%
Or they had a dividing point.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.490 align:middle line:84%
A gastroenteritis diarrhea
event 30 years ago,

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:02.100 align:middle line:84%
and then they were never
the same after that.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.217 align:middle line:84%
So we can take out our
good flora in many ways,

00:15:04.217 --> 00:15:06.300 align:middle line:84%
but it usually starts with
some kind of depletion.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Mom could have been depleted.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Mom could have had a
couple antibiotic rounds,

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
and her legacy that she passed
to the child wasn't great.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.000 align:middle line:84%
Or the baby was born
with a c-section.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.120 align:middle line:84%
I had a twilight birth, so
that was probably traumatic.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
Our birthing methods,
they're awesome.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.520 align:middle line:84%
I think they save
lives, but they

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.520 align:middle line:84%
may lead to a faulty depleted
microbiome for the baby.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.167 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Specifically how?

00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Mom's vaginal
canal generally

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.270 align:middle line:84%
has all the great species that
protect the next generation.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
So if it's a c-section,
we're going to bypass that.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And studies are showing that
even doing a vaginal swab,

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and swabbing the baby at
birth after a c-section,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.460 align:middle line:90%
isn't enough.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Mom literally delivers
trillions to the baby,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.180 align:middle line:90%
and maybe through her poop.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.195 align:middle line:84%
Because it's very natural
in the animal kingdom.

00:15:52.195 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Moms poop on their
babies a little bit.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
For herbivores,
it's very essential.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:16:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Camels, cows, elephants--
herbivore eating animals--

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.180 align:middle line:84%
if their mom doesn't deliver
some poop to the baby,

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:84%
the baby never can
digest food properly.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.173 align:middle line:90%
They'll die early.

00:16:07.173 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're so scared in
the modern age of poop.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.880 align:middle line:84%
So hyper-sanitary, hyper-hygiene
and super-sanitary.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Let's alcohol swipe everybody.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:84%
I've met families where the more
alcohol, disinfectants, Clorox

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.910 align:middle line:84%
they use, the more diseases
are in the children.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.440 align:middle line:84%
Early Type 1 diabetes, ADHD,
autism, things like that.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Our cleaning
practices are probably

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.377 align:middle line:84%
damaging our microbiome in every
generation that's following us.

00:16:30.377 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of sad, in my opinion.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:32.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:10%
I grew up on a farm,
and the whole reminds me

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.723 align:middle line:10%
that you'd get sick and the
answer was, rub some dirt

00:16:37.723 --> 00:16:38.640 align:middle line:10%
in it, you'll be fine.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.095 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Exactly.

00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:40.670 align:middle line:10%
I've heard that so many times.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.930 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:41.190 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.732 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And that's
kind of what you're

00:16:42.732 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:10%
doing, in a little bit
more sophisticated fashion,

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.600 align:middle line:10%
with these re-supplementation.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, you even
advise gut supplementation

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.690 align:middle line:90%
to MMA fighters.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.122 align:middle line:90%
Can you expound on that for us?

00:16:55.122 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, my
fighters love it.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:84%
We do a bionic fiber
blend with many of them,

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.210 align:middle line:90%
or a higher fiber diet.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.140 align:middle line:84%
A soluble with steel-cut
oatmeal, and maybe a scoop

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.710 align:middle line:90%
of macca for rejuvenation.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.349 align:middle line:84%
It's a root with also
great prebiotic properties.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:15.270 align:middle line:90%
And the fiber is a blend.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.109 align:middle line:90%
Anyone can make it.

00:17:16.109 --> 00:17:18.210 align:middle line:84%
We have different
recipes on our website.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.180 align:middle line:84%
But we want to feed the entire
portfolio of our microbiome,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.829 align:middle line:84%
so we need different
kind of fibers.

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And our ancestors-- studies
show in the Paleolithic age,

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:31.950 align:middle line:84%
before Walmart and
supermarkets appeared,

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.240 align:middle line:90%
we foraged a lot of food.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We spent all day
forging food, all day

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.410 align:middle line:90%
eating and chewing food, right?

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And the fiber content was
predicted to be about 100,

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:90%
130 grams of fiber a day.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
But literally,
Americans now almost

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:84%
eat barely five to
seven grams a day.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.360 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Paleo
diet, which I love,

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.490 align:middle line:84%
or other diets that
are gut-healing,

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
maybe no more than two to
three grams of fiber a day.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So we build some fiber, 20
to 30 grams supplementation.

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.320 align:middle line:84%
It could be some
organic psyllium fiber,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
with some inulin, glucomannan,
which is a gooey root fiber.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
There's so many amazing
different prebiotics

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that we're so lucky
to have access to now,

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.600 align:middle line:84%
that we can rebuild
a lot of our gut.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm into the TV show
from our generation

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
called The Bionic Man
and the Bionic Woman.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.420 align:middle line:84%
You probably remember
if you watched TV, yeah.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.275 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't watch a lot of TV,
but we were able to watch some.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.108 align:middle line:84%
So we can rebuild
beyond where we started,

00:18:33.108 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
and feel even better
than where we started,

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.275 align:middle line:84%
because most people
have grown up

00:18:36.275 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:84%
eating these pretty awful
standard American diets

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:90%
with low fiber growing up.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
So they actually feel
better than they ever

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
have their whole lives, even
before their teens and 20s.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
They're calmer, happier,
and they perform better.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.300 align:middle line:84%
The MMA fighters, I try
to protect their brains.

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.140 align:middle line:84%
We do brain rebuilding
programs as well,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.350 align:middle line:84%
because there's a massive
gut-brain connection.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.620 align:middle line:84%
Not just hormones and
gonads gut connection,

00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
but the brain connection.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And probiotics and
fiber are shown

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:90%
to regenerate our neurons.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
It's called BDNF, this hormone
that rebuilds the neurons

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.710 align:middle line:90%
and prunes them properly.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Maybe we
should take a moment

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.237 align:middle line:10%
and make sure that
our viewers know what

00:19:11.237 --> 00:19:13.310 align:middle line:10%
MMA fighters are dealing with.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yeah, so mixed martial
art fighters are really amazing

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.430 align:middle line:10%
endurance athletes.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
They know multiple
martial arts, and they're

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:84%
doing a lot of
endurance training,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:90%
and also burst training--

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.250 align:middle line:90%
heavy lifting.

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And they fight in a
cage, so when they fight,

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.160 align:middle line:90%
they can get hit in the head.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.800 align:middle line:84%
That's part of the goal, to
knock the other person out.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's a bit
of brain damage,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.950 align:middle line:84%
and we know that whenever
our brain breaks,

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:90%
our gut will break.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So I do a lot to help
protect their guts.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And we do probiotics-- all
diverse kinds of probiotics,

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
from soil-based probiotics,
to one of our own signature

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:90%
probiotics.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Covers all the strains that
we need, from baby, to birth,

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and up all the way until
80s, 90s, 100 years old

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:90%
for longevity.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And we build in the fiber to
anchor them and feed them,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.100 align:middle line:90%
and the fiber's really critical.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:02.900 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.400 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And this is true also
for people who are not choosing

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.590 align:middle line:10%
to fight in cages and have
their heads potentially kicked

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.390 align:middle line:10%
by something--

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: Yeah, like for
instance, executives like you,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.275 align:middle line:10%
who run empires and travel.

00:20:16.275 --> 00:20:18.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, executives who make
important financial decisions,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:84%
or they have
employees under them,

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
to have the best decisions
for their employees

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.545 align:middle line:90%
and the families they feed.

00:20:24.545 --> 00:20:28.400 align:middle line:84%
And moms-- a lot of our moms
are so multitasking now.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.570 align:middle line:90%
They do a 40-hour work week.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
They go home, cook, clean, take
care of two to four children,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and two or three
dogs, and a husband.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Our moms are super-powered
totally amazing, Bionic moms.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
I want to keep them healthy
as much as possible.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.350 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And oftentimes
working so much harder

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.100 align:middle line:10%
to get life done than we
really need to be working.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.520 align:middle line:10%
But because we grew up inside
of a compromised situation,

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.480 align:middle line:10%
people don't realize that it's
harder than it needs to be,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:10%
that the brain
fog isn't natural,

00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.750 align:middle line:10%
that fatigue isn't just
because you're getting older.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:10%
Actually, people could be
getting younger all the time,

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:04.070 align:middle line:10%
if only we could turn the
system back into the way

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.300 align:middle line:10%
that it was supposed
to be functioning.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Exactly.

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.393 align:middle line:84%
And that 2:00, 3:00
o'clock triple espresso,

00:21:08.393 --> 00:21:09.560 align:middle line:90%
it's not necessarily normal.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.755 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:11.755 --> 00:21:13.130 align:middle line:10%
Just because it's
popular doesn't

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.740 align:middle line:10%
mean we were born to
have to need that.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.663 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So clients
come to you, and you

00:21:16.663 --> 00:21:18.492 align:middle line:84%
begin testing the gut
right off the bat.

00:21:18.492 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah we want to
show them the testing.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You start
there because, why?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: We're very
evidence-based.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I teach our programs to
coaches and clinicians

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:84%
so they can learn
how to do this,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.170 align:middle line:84%
and they always get
amazing results.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.850 align:middle line:90%
And everything's evidence-based.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:33.517 align:middle line:84%
We're really lucky,
in this day and age,

00:21:33.517 --> 00:21:35.240 align:middle line:84%
that the research
backs up what we do.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.887 align:middle line:84%
The botanicals we use, the
herbals and probiotics,

00:21:38.887 --> 00:21:41.220 align:middle line:84%
and how they turn on the
immune system in the right way.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We don't want either
too little or too less.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.050 align:middle line:90%
That's sweet zone.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.342 align:middle line:90%
Everything's our immune system.

00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:46.820 align:middle line:84%
80% of our immune
system's actually

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
in the gut, the large intestine
and in the small intestine.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:90%
And we can test that now.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:84%
We do noninvasive urine
organic acid testing.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:56.840 align:middle line:90%
We run that on everybody.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We can look at antibodies, which
are an arm of our immune system

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.707 align:middle line:84%
and look at, what is
it fighting against?

00:22:04.707 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, we
find a lot of people

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:10.530 align:middle line:84%
are fighting against common
denominators in every gut,

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:11.630 align:middle line:90%
and that's not right.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
When we're launching attack
against flora that already live

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.280 align:middle line:84%
in the gut, a lot of their
cell wall-- the proteins

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and actually the
signature around them--

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:25.430 align:middle line:84%
look like our thyroid, or
brain, or joints, or muscles,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.415 align:middle line:90%
or mitochondria.

00:22:26.415 --> 00:22:28.040 align:middle line:84%
And when we launch
attack against them,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.120 align:middle line:90%
people don't feel well.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.880 align:middle line:84%
It's basically an autoimmune
response going on.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:35.897 align:middle line:84%
Could be to our blood
vessels, then that

00:22:35.897 --> 00:22:36.980 align:middle line:90%
can lead to heart disease.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
Could be to even pancreas cells.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
That can look like
diabetes for some people.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
So we look at some of
the antibodies going on.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is when
these antibodies go down,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.002 align:middle line:84%
people feel less anxious,
even not anxious at all.

00:22:51.002 --> 00:22:52.460 align:middle line:84%
They're able to
get off medication.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
attention deficit.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.820 align:middle line:84%
They're able to get
off medications.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.112 align:middle line:84%
They feel concentrated and
focused without medications.

00:22:58.112 --> 00:22:59.030 align:middle line:90%
It's awesome.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're alleviating
this conflict

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.350 align:middle line:84%
going on in the body,
congestion and conflict.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.813 align:middle line:84%
Because of our immune
system, it's hypersensitive,

00:23:05.813 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
but in this day and age,
there's just too many

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.220 align:middle line:84%
floating around friendly
fire, because we've

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.070 align:middle line:84%
lost the component
of our microbiome.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.900 align:middle line:10%
We only have so much
energy, and if it's

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:10%
being diverted into trying to
compensate for something that's

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:10%
not happening, then
we end up experiencing

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.080 align:middle line:10%
that loss of energy and vitality
just to get through our day,

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.800 align:middle line:10%
much less maintain our immunity.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Right, and there's
not enough espresso or yoga

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that will fix that,
or kale or spinach.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.858 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yeah, it'll take too
long, because the system that's

00:23:33.858 --> 00:23:35.440 align:middle line:84%
trying to metabolize
that good kale

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.610 align:middle line:84%
or spinach that you're
eating isn't working right.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.950 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It's extinct often.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.975 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yeah.

00:23:39.975 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And it actually can
become toxifying to the system

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.910 align:middle line:84%
when it is unable to
metabolize those things.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
doing this testing,

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.410 align:middle line:90%
exactly what do you do?

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.060 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
the acid test,

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:50.990 align:middle line:84%
can you just describe
the things that you do?

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I can.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.690 align:middle line:90%
So we'll do three simple tasks.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.940 align:middle line:90%
One is a stool kit.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.640 align:middle line:84%
It's not perfect, because
the large intestine

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.950 align:middle line:84%
is just the last 1 and 1/2
meters of our big gut, which

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:84%
is literally seven to 8
meters for most people.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.380 align:middle line:84%
But we like to look at the stool
testing, because often what's

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.522 align:middle line:84%
overflowing from upstream
will also overflow

00:24:09.522 --> 00:24:10.730 align:middle line:90%
and show up on the stool kit.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:90%
So we'll do a stool kit.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.402 align:middle line:90%
I love the GI-Map.

00:24:13.402 --> 00:24:15.110 align:middle line:84%
I'll just throw it
out there, but there's

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:84%
many really good
stool kits out there.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And I love the Thryve kit
too, because we can actually

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.480 align:middle line:90%
drill down genera and species.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.230 align:middle line:84%
So these are the little names
of our wealth portfolio.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.910 align:middle line:84%
It's good to know what
they are in there.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.415 align:middle line:84%
The second is the immune panel
I told you about-- an IgG panel.

00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:31.790 align:middle line:84%
Often it looks at
food allergies.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.665 align:middle line:84%
I don't really look at
it for food allergies,

00:24:33.665 --> 00:24:36.950 align:middle line:84%
but I mostly look at it to
see what launched attacks

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.505 align:middle line:90%
going on against certain flora.

00:24:38.505 --> 00:24:40.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So you're
asking someone, if you

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.153 align:middle line:90%
eat this it responds how?

00:24:42.153 --> 00:24:43.820 align:middle line:84%
If you eat this, how
does it affect you?

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.990 align:middle line:90%
Do you feel badly?

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: For instance,
a lot of people

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.810 align:middle line:84%
can't eat gluten when
they first work with us.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.875 align:middle line:84%
But within two to four weeks,
they'll get an exposure,

00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:52.250 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
problems at all.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in four,
six months, they

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.170 align:middle line:90%
can eat it, no problem again.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:55.970 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: An interesting thing.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.370 align:middle line:84%
We blame it on
the gluten, but it

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.840 align:middle line:84%
might be that we're
just not able to digest

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.158 align:middle line:84%
the gluten because we don't
have our system functioning

00:25:02.158 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:90%
the way it's supposed to.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.510 align:middle line:10%
And so, it's some
of each, perhaps,

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.450 align:middle line:10%
that we need to
address, which could

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.150 align:middle line:10%
make us less afraid of
ever having to eat bread

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.370 align:middle line:10%
in a restaurant somewhere.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.770 align:middle line:84%
So we just have to
turn our attention

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.540 align:middle line:84%
to the whole picture
of what's going on,

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.642 align:middle line:84%
instead of becoming
afraid and having to avoid

00:25:19.642 --> 00:25:20.600 align:middle line:90%
so many things in life.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.975 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, we
can't keep just

00:25:21.975 --> 00:25:23.480 align:middle line:90%
restricting and restricting.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.400 align:middle line:84%
There's reasons I
think, behind it.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Because that doesn't
even lead to emotional health,

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:27.690 align:middle line:10%
right?

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.010 align:middle line:90%
If we're constantly having to--

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:29.310 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: That fear, yeah.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a phobia, which is
not healthy for someone,

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:32.600 align:middle line:90%
as you know, too.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And makes their
gut more permeable,

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
in my opinion, because that
increases cortisol, adrenaline,

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.390 align:middle line:84%
and all these
hormones that actually

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.723 align:middle line:84%
are known to impact the gut,
and make it more permeable.

00:25:41.723 --> 00:25:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Something that
might be helpful for people

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.560 align:middle line:84%
to hear about,
the four protocols

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.050 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking for,
and specifically what

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:50.640 align:middle line:90%
the benefit of each of them is.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.260 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: So parasites
get a bad rap,

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.830 align:middle line:84%
but in most of the modern world,
we have a lot of parasites that

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.630 align:middle line:90%
people--

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.430 align:middle line:90%
it's silent.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.320 align:middle line:90%
It's not seen.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:84%
In third-world countries,
parasites are rampant.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.260 align:middle line:84%
People get it through the
water or contact with animals,

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and children from early ages are
getting anti-parasitic medicine

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.150 align:middle line:90%
every year.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:12.053 align:middle line:84%
It's like candy, because
the burden is high,

00:26:12.053 --> 00:26:13.470 align:middle line:84%
and it will help
them to lower it.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:84%
But here in the
Western world, we

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.130 align:middle line:84%
tend to think, oh,
no one has parasites.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.310 align:middle line:90%
But that's not really true.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.340 align:middle line:84%
And when we do testing
deeper, we always

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:23.042 align:middle line:84%
find parasites,
100% of the time.

00:26:23.042 --> 00:26:24.000 align:middle line:90%
So we have four phases.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.090 align:middle line:84%
It starts from big microbe
to smaller microbe.

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%
We go big to small.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So our first phase,
we look at the largest

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.660 align:middle line:84%
potential parasitic
overgrowths in the gut.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And those are the larger
worms and protozoa,

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.620 align:middle line:84%
like Giardia, which are really
common if you go camping.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Or Blastocystis if you
eat sushi or eat salads.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.060 align:middle line:84%
You may have exposure
to this in raw food--

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.180 align:middle line:84%
raw sushi, raw fish, or raw
salads, things like that.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The second size down
is fungal overgrowth,

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:90%
so Candida, yeast, Rhodotorula.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.440 align:middle line:90%
Many fungi live in our gut.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.670 align:middle line:90%
We have good ones.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.132 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
Mucor species that

00:27:01.132 --> 00:27:02.340 align:middle line:90%
are associated with leanness.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.240 align:middle line:90%
I won't mention it.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.880 align:middle line:90%
It's just a name--

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.680 align:middle line:90%
Mucor.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.510 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
not great Mucor,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.530 align:middle line:84%
which associated
with morbid obesity,

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.690 align:middle line:90%
diabetes, metabolic syndrome.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So there's bad fungi,
and they can overgrow.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of them even
move in our gut.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.990 align:middle line:84%
They have hyphae,
little branches.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.632 align:middle line:84%
They can completely
override someone's system

00:27:22.632 --> 00:27:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and cause a lot of
immune problems.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:31.510 align:middle line:84%
So fungi, about 100 to
10x bigger than bacteria.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.510 align:middle line:90%
So we take care of that.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:90%
We help look at those.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
phase are bacterial.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And bacteria range in all
sizes, but they can be

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.300 align:middle line:90%
really small or kind of bigger.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:90%
We focus on bacteria.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.348 align:middle line:84%
And then the last
is viruses, and it

00:27:44.348 --> 00:27:46.140 align:middle line:84%
could be co-infections
and spirochetes too.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Here, Boulder, in Colorado,
there can be a lot of Lyme.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.130 align:middle line:84%
In California, we actually
have a lot of Lyme.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.900 align:middle line:90%
More than we thought, yeah.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we look at
different co-infections--

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Lyme and viruses--
like, Epstein-Barr,

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.340 align:middle line:84%
or cytomegalovirus,
HHV-6, Herpes family 6.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.340 align:middle line:84%
But there are many viruses
that we can encounter.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.480 align:middle line:84%
Our good flora, our other
good half, when we're depleted

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:84%
and we're missing them, they
are actually our firewalls.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.515 align:middle line:84%
So in a way, it's like a
computer, someone's computer.

00:28:18.515 --> 00:28:19.890 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
good firewalls,

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:22.230 align:middle line:84%
you go and play on
a certain website,

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.770 align:middle line:84%
you can get spammed, and
malware, and viruses.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.680 align:middle line:90%
You just collect it.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.510 align:middle line:10%
If it's really bad, you're
going to lose your hard drive,

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.427 align:middle line:10%
get corruption of your
really important photos

00:28:29.427 --> 00:28:30.750 align:middle line:10%
and files, right?

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.580 align:middle line:90%
So we rebuild the firewalls.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.690 align:middle line:90%
That's our ultimate goal.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You speak about
this organic acid testing.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:36.690 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you expand
on that a little bit.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Oh, yeah.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.793 align:middle line:90%
I love the organic acid testing.

00:28:39.793 --> 00:28:42.068 align:middle line:84%
It's super non-invasive, so
we can do it in children.

00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:44.610 align:middle line:84%
It's the first morning urine,
and they freeze it, and send it

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:45.720 align:middle line:90%
to the Great Plains lab.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.500 align:middle line:90%
That's the lab we prefer.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.280 align:middle line:84%
So organic acids
means it can assess

00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.682 align:middle line:84%
all the different small
chemicals that are in the body.

00:28:52.682 --> 00:28:54.390 align:middle line:84%
What's in the bloodstream
will eventually

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:56.807 align:middle line:84%
be filtered through the kidney,
so we see it in the urine,

00:28:56.807 --> 00:28:57.607 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:28:57.607 --> 00:28:59.820 align:middle line:84%
And I love this test,
because on the first page

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.800 align:middle line:84%
we have a whole
microbiome assessment.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.870 align:middle line:90%
The founder and CEO--

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry, he's the founder.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.380 align:middle line:90%
I think he used to be CEO.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But his name is
Dr. William Shaw.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.280 align:middle line:84%
He works with a lot of
autistic children, children

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.090 align:middle line:84%
with neuro atypical
signs, as well as adults.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And he's really made this
test to be a great assessment

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.400 align:middle line:84%
of what's going on in the
body for health, wellness,

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and longevity.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So the first page
is all microbiome.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first nine
signs on there,

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.020 align:middle line:84%
the first nine lab markers,
are for fungal overgrowth.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So we see really what's
going on, and even

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.242 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of mold.

00:29:34.242 --> 00:29:35.700 align:middle line:84%
If your firewalls
are down, you may

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.830 align:middle line:84%
grow a little bit of mold spores
in your body and have mold.

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.710 align:middle line:84%
It's not just from
diet exposures,

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.440 align:middle line:84%
but there's some mold,
and we can see that.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And our register
to improve health,

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.300 align:middle line:84%
we have low registers
compared to the lab,

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.860 align:middle line:90%
so we see health really revive.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:84%
We see all the markers go
almost to zero, really low.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And then there's nine markers
for bacterial overgrowth,

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:90%
which are very common, yeah.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Because when we lose our
good bacterial microbiome,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.690 align:middle line:84%
the good bacteria, then
the bad pathogenic,

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:09.080 align:middle line:84%
really viral kind of
bacteria and overgrowing.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:12.520 align:middle line:90%
For instance, strep, or E. coli.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.930 align:middle line:84%
Clostridium is
particularly nasty,

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and it's really neurologically
not very good too.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.958 align:middle line:84%
People can have a lot
of brain fog with it,

00:30:20.958 --> 00:30:22.750 align:middle line:84%
as well as either
diarrhea or constipation.

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.490 align:middle line:84%
So Clostridium-- they
come from the family

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.760 align:middle line:84%
where botulinum, Clostridium
difficile, and tetanus

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.193 align:middle line:84%
came from, so they can really
impact the neurologic system

00:30:32.193 --> 00:30:33.360 align:middle line:90%
and neuromuscular junctions.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.180 align:middle line:84%
So people don't feel
right, or are clumsy.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Another part of this
test looks at oxalates.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.798 align:middle line:84%
And oxalates are like the
pollution in the human body.

00:30:41.798 --> 00:30:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And we have genetics
to actually help

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.980 align:middle line:84%
us foster better
breakdown, so people

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.480 align:middle line:84%
who don't have those
great genetics,

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.610 align:middle line:84%
they may have more
problems with oxalates.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
Oxalates also are found
in all our superfoods--

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
seeds, berries, kale, spinach,
a little bit whole grains.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.380 align:middle line:84%
Yet, we want all
these good foods,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.720 align:middle line:84%
but if someone has
really deep dysbiosis

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and they have too much
fungal overgrowth--

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.780 align:middle line:84%
so fungi are the big
producers of oxalates.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have three oxalate
markers on there,

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.072 align:middle line:84%
and so we can know
when there's a lot

00:31:12.072 --> 00:31:15.200 align:middle line:84%
of fungal overgrowth, when
these are a little suboptimal.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, we have
a lower register.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.810 align:middle line:84%
When it's kind of above
1/5 of a median range,

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.730 align:middle line:84%
we know something's
going on with the person.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And we want to work
on fungal overgrowths,

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.603 align:middle line:90%
and mold in a mold overgrowth.

00:31:27.603 --> 00:31:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So people always feel better,
and they can eat more foods,

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.210 align:middle line:84%
including the superfoods if
they had intolerances earlier.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.043 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this is what
I wanted to clarify.

00:31:34.043 --> 00:31:36.740 align:middle line:10%
So we're checking for something,
it's in the superfoods,

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:41.900 align:middle line:10%
but it can be existing in too
high of a quantity in the body?

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so, how are we
wanting to balance that out?

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.910 align:middle line:90%
What do we do to balance that?

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: That's a
fantastic question.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.620 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a
great microbiome,

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and the full complement
of our microbiome.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:56.630 align:middle line:84%
We have bacteria that
break down oxalates for us.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:00.500 align:middle line:84%
There's a whole symphony
full of oxalate degraders,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.300 align:middle line:90%
they're known as.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:02.510 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And our probiotic, the
signature one I made,

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.780 align:middle line:84%
happens to have at least five
strains are inherently known

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.940 align:middle line:90%
to break down oxalates.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.000 align:middle line:84%
They're actually species-wide
benefits, and characteristics,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.750 align:middle line:90%
and traits.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.730 align:middle line:90%
Kind of like dogs.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.320 align:middle line:90%
Bacteria are kind like dogs.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.478 align:middle line:90%
There's different traits.

00:32:19.478 --> 00:32:21.770 align:middle line:84%
One looks like a Labrador,
one looks like a Great Dane,

00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:23.062 align:middle line:90%
one looks like a little poodle.

00:32:23.062 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And they have little traits,
like curly hair, straight hair,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.640 align:middle line:90%
human-like hair, non-allogeneic.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.100 align:middle line:90%
Our bacteria are like that too.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.037 align:middle line:84%
And we know, because
oxalates are in our food,

00:32:34.037 --> 00:32:35.870 align:middle line:84%
we have a whole complement
through evolution

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:84%
that broke them down as
we evolved and started

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.070 align:middle line:84%
eating these food--
seeds, berries,

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.670 align:middle line:84%
some whole grains,
and a lot of greens

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:44.360 align:middle line:90%
that are high in oxalates.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.330 align:middle line:84%
So when we lose them-- studies
show when we give antibiotics,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.600 align:middle line:84%
we lose that ability, and more
oxalates appear in the urine.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.987 align:middle line:84%
And certain probiotics, certain
bifido and lactobacilli,

00:32:53.987 --> 00:32:56.320 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the ones found
in our signature probiotic,

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.370 align:middle line:84%
BIFIDO MAXIMUS, when probiotics
are used, oxalates go down.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
They're more degraded,
and less show up in urine.

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:04.010 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.990 align:middle line:84%
What we find in our clients,
probiotics aren't enough.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we look
at overgrowths start

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.280 align:middle line:84%
to ratchet down a little bit,
and resurrect what's missing.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Mm-hmm.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.880 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And then we see about
the balance shift,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:17.817 align:middle line:84%
and almost instantly, in
two to four weeks or less,

00:33:17.817 --> 00:33:19.400 align:middle line:84%
people can start
expanding their diet.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.750 align:middle line:84%
When a lot of our
clients come to us,

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.040 align:middle line:84%
they have so many
food allergies,

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.540 align:middle line:84%
they literally don't even go
out with their friends, which

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.665 align:middle line:90%
is super depressing, right?

00:33:24.665 --> 00:33:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't help the
healing process.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.863 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, they
don't see their friends,

00:33:28.863 --> 00:33:33.380 align:middle line:84%
and laugh, and have that
fellowship, and the pheromones.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.898 align:middle line:84%
And they get tired of
explaining to their friends,

00:33:35.898 --> 00:33:37.940 align:middle line:84%
oh, I can't eat this and
that, and this and that.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.917 align:middle line:84%
They're down to
four foods on Earth.

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.750 align:middle line:84%
We always see people
that expand to 40 foods

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.228 align:middle line:90%
in about a month to four weeks.

00:33:43.228 --> 00:33:44.270 align:middle line:90%
Some of our children too.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:49.430 align:middle line:84%
They have really
broken gut microbiomes,

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.810 align:middle line:84%
and mom has them on
very restricted diets.

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.250 align:middle line:84%
One family, he
couldn't eat fish.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It was almost
anaphylactic reaction--

00:33:58.530 --> 00:33:59.330 align:middle line:90%
lip swelling.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Not tongue or throat
swelling, fortunately.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And within four weeks,
he was on our protocols,

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.663 align:middle line:84%
started to sleep better--
he was having nightmares

00:34:06.663 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:84%
all through his
naps and at night.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Within two weeks he started to
sleep deeper and no more nap

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.155 align:middle line:90%
terrors.

00:34:13.155 --> 00:34:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Within four weeks,
his mom had him out,

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:15.988 align:middle line:90%
and she just gave him salmon.

00:34:15.988 --> 00:34:17.297 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, OK.

00:34:17.297 --> 00:34:18.380 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't have done that.

00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.820 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, oh, he was fine.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.900 align:middle line:90%
No problems at all.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And earlier he was literally,
almost anaphylactic reaction

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.860 align:middle line:90%
to fish.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And the mom is a doctor herself,
and she's like, oh, he's fine.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.080 align:middle line:84%
I had my epi-pen I
was like, OK, good.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.070 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So we see these really
miraculous changes,

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just so grateful
our protocols are effective,

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.409 align:middle line:84%
and we have the tools available
now-- the testing, the tools,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.929 align:middle line:84%
probiotics to
resurrect, and then

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.360 align:middle line:84%
certain fibers to
anchor everything

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.440 align:middle line:90%
at the appropriate time.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What about iron levels?

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Oh, yeah.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.372 align:middle line:84%
So I've been fascinated
by the Viking heritage.

00:34:51.372 --> 00:34:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Not just from the TV
shows and Game of Thrones,

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:54.663 align:middle line:90%
but I've always been fascinated.

00:34:54.663 --> 00:34:56.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.710 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They took over a
lot of the world.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:01.580 align:middle line:84%
The largest conquerors
of contiguous land

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.887 align:middle line:90%
on Earth, right?

00:35:03.887 --> 00:35:04.970 align:middle line:90%
They were great migrators.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.430 align:middle line:84%
They're really
brilliant, sophisticated.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:07.370 align:middle line:90%
They're also matrilineal.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.912 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you're aware of that.

00:35:08.912 --> 00:35:11.110 align:middle line:84%
National Geographic had
this big display last fall,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:11.750 align:middle line:90%
and presentation.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: No.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Two of the biggest burials
were female burials.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:16.370 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating, huh?

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Female monarchs that ruled.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.620 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.100 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: They're hiding it.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.670 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: It makes sense.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And Vikings conquered
a lot of great land,

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.560 align:middle line:84%
and they can track literally
their entire migration

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.430 align:middle line:84%
and conquering the land with
this hemochromatosis gene

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:90%
marker--

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:90%
HFE, hemochromatosis.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So they literally spread
this iron overload condition

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:90%
to everywhere they went.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.590 align:middle line:84%
And who knows if this
evolutionary change

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:42.610 align:middle line:90%
was adaptive?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.890 align:middle line:84%
At that time, grains
were more eaten.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Grains, if they're not soaked
and fermented by good bacteria

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:51.600 align:middle line:84%
overnight or two in
water, the lectins--

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm a nutrition
background person.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.993 align:middle line:84%
There's chemicals
in whole grains

00:35:55.993 --> 00:35:57.160 align:middle line:90%
called lectins and phytates.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And if they're not
soaked, if they're not

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.880 align:middle line:84%
fermented by bacteria that
break them down overnight,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:07.780 align:middle line:84%
then whole grains can
bind our vital minerals.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So zinc, calcium,
magnesium, also iron.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So any iron that's in the
diet will get pulled out,

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.280 align:middle line:90%
not absorbed by the body.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.250 align:middle line:84%
So there's perhaps
an adaptive thing

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:21.310 align:middle line:84%
that happened genetically,
where people would accumulate

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.790 align:middle line:84%
iron more, maybe to offset
the use of this amazing diet

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.990 align:middle line:90%
food called whole grains, right?

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Amaranth, millet,
oats, they were all

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.940 align:middle line:90%
started to being eaten then.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, the ancient
grains packed that.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.880 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, hemochromatosis,
it's a great adaptation,

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.162 align:middle line:84%
because it would
facilitate oxygen.

00:36:42.162 --> 00:36:44.620 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of doping the blood
to have energy and endurance

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.860 align:middle line:84%
through long activities,
physical activities,

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.940 align:middle line:84%
even though someone's not
eating iron-rich food or meat.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
interesting, we attract

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.413 align:middle line:84%
a lot of really interesting
characters and clients,

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:56.830 align:middle line:84%
and there are all
iron overloaded.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.205 align:middle line:84%
That seems to be
what we attract.

00:36:58.205 --> 00:37:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And I, myself, I'm
probably some kind

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.730 align:middle line:84%
of genetic Asian warrior
type, because I've

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.050 align:middle line:90%
a little iron overload too.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how about the hormonal
system and the microbiome?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.600 align:middle line:10%
Can you speak into that,
and how this regulates,

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.130 align:middle line:10%
and how it affects us?

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yes.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I got really fascinated
with the hormone picture

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.970 align:middle line:84%
in the microbiome because my
own health, but in our clients,

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.940 align:middle line:84%
we see these rapid changes
in their hormone imbalance,

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.580 align:middle line:84%
with no changes with
bioidentical hormones,

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.890 align:middle line:84%
or really changing in terms
of their supplement habits

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.528 align:middle line:90%
and programs for hormones.

00:37:31.528 --> 00:37:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And what we would see is, if
we just worked on the gut,

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.180 align:middle line:84%
we'd see these instant
changes in their hormones,

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.610 align:middle line:84%
to where they're
balanced naturally.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So women who had PMS, PMDD--
that means depression with

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.740 align:middle line:90%
their menstrual cycle--

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.350 align:middle line:84%
or cysts, fibroids, these
overgrowths associated

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:84%
with female reproductive issues,
they would almost instantly

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.090 align:middle line:90%
go away in a month or two.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Some of our ladies who have PCOS
and really severe facial hair,

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.850 align:middle line:84%
having to shave every
day or every other day,

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.830 align:middle line:84%
in two months or
less it was gone.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So I knew what we're on
to, really is helpful.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of our men, they'd be
young, in their '40s, '30s,

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and they'd report to me, no
libido, no morning erection.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So they actually had a form
of erectile dysfunction,

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.110 align:middle line:90%
being so young.

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:20.610 align:middle line:84%
We'd hear quickly, in just
a month or two or less,

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:84%
like full function in 80%
to 100% of every morning.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:26.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.657 align:middle line:84%
One of my gentlemen, a
client, he had high PSA.

00:38:29.657 --> 00:38:31.240 align:middle line:84%
He had worked with
many practitioners.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.620 align:middle line:84%
His doctor couldn't
lower the PSA.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.203 align:middle line:84%
So he's a little
worried about cancer.

00:38:34.203 --> 00:38:36.640 align:middle line:84%
So PSA stands for
prostate specific antigen.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.357 align:middle line:84%
It's a marker for
prostate cancer.

00:38:38.357 --> 00:38:40.690 align:middle line:84%
And as you know, most prostate
cancers are slow-growing.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:42.107 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to kill anybody,

00:38:42.107 --> 00:38:44.150 align:middle line:90%
but he was kind of concerned.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.290 align:middle line:84%
He had also Hashimoto's,
really common

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:49.450 align:middle line:84%
low thyroid
autoimmune condition.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.900 align:middle line:84%
He had high antibodies, so
he'd worked with people,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.740 align:middle line:84%
not gotten the
results he wanted.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.840 align:middle line:84%
In two months or less,
we normalized his PSA,

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.100 align:middle line:84%
his antibodies for
thyroid came way down.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.593 align:middle line:84%
And other clients, like our
male executives in their 50s,

00:39:02.593 --> 00:39:04.510 align:middle line:84%
we literally doubled
their total testosterone,

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.093 align:middle line:84%
tripled their free testosterone,
because they start off so low

00:39:07.093 --> 00:39:08.750 align:middle line:90%
to begin with sometimes.

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And even our younger men, great
results lowering the SHBG--

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.550 align:middle line:84%
sex hormone-binding
globulin-- the brake,

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.890 align:middle line:90%
and doubling a lot of their--

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:21.670 align:middle line:84%
naturally no supplements,
other than supportive,

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:23.410 align:middle line:90%
like adrenal glands.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's a study actually
by Kelton Tremellen,

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.000 align:middle line:84%
from a pharmacy school,
University of South Australia

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.710 align:middle line:84%
in Adelaide, he actually
tested giving the cell

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:39.830 align:middle line:84%
wall parts of a flora
we all have in the gut,

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and he gave this
dose of the cell

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.910 align:middle line:84%
wall of a pro-inflammatory
gut pathogen.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And he gave a very low
dose to healthy men.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:90%
There were about 33 men.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:52.877 align:middle line:84%
They were age 18 to 40,
very healthy German men.

00:39:52.877 --> 00:39:53.710 align:middle line:90%
He gave a low dose--

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:56.980 align:middle line:84%
0.8 nanograms per
kilo of weight,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and he saw within six hours,
their testosterone pretty much

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.720 align:middle line:90%
tanked.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:06.850 align:middle line:84%
But our flora, if we have too
much, or our gut's permeable,

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.550 align:middle line:84%
they're going to enter our body
systems and then cause havoc.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:10.592 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I've seen.

00:40:10.592 --> 00:40:12.640 align:middle line:84%
We were tightening and
sealing people's gut up,

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and then that would
reverse on its own.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.280 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it's really great
to see these studies start

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%
to back up what
we're doing, that

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:24.130 align:middle line:84%
has to do with this whole
complement of bacteria--

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of trillions--
and how we can help them,

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.440 align:middle line:84%
and bring back the allies, lower
some of the pathogens a bit,

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and then we can see health
just instantly get better.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.113 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, phenomenal.

00:40:34.113 --> 00:40:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Something that always
comes to mind for people

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:40.700 align:middle line:84%
is, I wonder if my toxicity
levels are already up in such

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.220 align:middle line:90%
a place that I needed a detox.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's a popular thing,
it's a popular question,

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and I think it's really
relevant for us speak to.

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.880 align:middle line:90%
Detox.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.850 align:middle line:10%
How can people do detox
correctly, safely?

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.130 align:middle line:90%
What can you say about that?

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: That's such a loaded
question, Dr. Sue, yeah.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:00.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm not the biggest
fan of detox protocols,

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.350 align:middle line:84%
usually because
on the back end we

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.900 align:middle line:84%
see clients who no
longer metabolize food

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.360 align:middle line:90%
after a certain detox, yeah.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.520 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a great
gut biome to begin with.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.020 align:middle line:84%
When someone's
considering detox,

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.890 align:middle line:84%
because we flush all our
pathogens through the gut,

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.050 align:middle line:84%
we have to be able to
have stools twice a day,

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:22.250 align:middle line:84%
minimum to let the toxins
go out that normally

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.002 align:middle line:90%
are excreted through the stool.

00:41:24.002 --> 00:41:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So a lot people to
start with, they

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.710 align:middle line:90%
don't have a great microbiome.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Now they're just unloading
toxins that are stored in fat,

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:35.348 align:middle line:84%
and they have no receptacle
to safely unload them.

00:41:35.348 --> 00:41:36.890 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
going to recirculate

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.120 align:middle line:90%
a lot of these toxins.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.103 align:middle line:84%
And there are studies that show
if people lose a lot of weight,

00:41:41.103 --> 00:41:43.020 align:middle line:84%
they're actually at
higher risk for mortality,

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.060 align:middle line:90%
which is so unusual.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I lost 50 pounds myself.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.660 align:middle line:84%
That statistic shocked
me, and there are

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.947 align:middle line:90%
many studies that show that.

00:41:48.947 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's because now,
in our modern world,

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.290 align:middle line:84%
we have so many
fat-stored toxins.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And when we unload
it too quick, and we

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.830 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
facilities in our body

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.108 align:middle line:84%
to bind them all up safely
and excrete them all safely,

00:42:01.108 --> 00:42:02.900 align:middle line:84%
then we're just going
to re-circulate that,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and that ends up
causing more problems.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.912 align:middle line:84%
All of sudden, you
of a nuclear dump,

00:42:05.912 --> 00:42:07.640 align:middle line:84%
but it's staying
in the body instead

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.300 align:middle line:90%
of being safely excreted.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of
the detox protocols

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.820 align:middle line:84%
are very restricted diets,
and usually their fruit.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So fructose, if you don't
have bifido bacteria,

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:19.670 align:middle line:90%
and a good complement of them--

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.350 align:middle line:90%
we need good flora.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:25.505 align:middle line:84%
They help us with metabolizing
the fructose sugar in fruit.

00:42:25.505 --> 00:42:27.380 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have it,
you're going to cause--

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.172 align:middle line:84%
if there's too much
fructose in the system,

00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:31.380 align:middle line:84%
we're going to cause
something called fatty liver.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:33.060 align:middle line:84%
So we actually need
these good bacteria.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.570 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have such an
epidemic now of fatty liver

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and obesity.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Someone also could
be skinny fat.

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean just
because they look skinny,

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.000 align:middle line:90%
they actually are healthy.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.750 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, some overweight
people are healthier

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.460 align:middle line:90%
than people who are skinny fat.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the skinny fat also
can have this congested liver

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:53.225 align:middle line:84%
and inability to break down
common sugars in the diet,

00:42:53.225 --> 00:42:55.850 align:middle line:84%
because they're missing the good
bacteria and their liver tests

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:56.700 align:middle line:90%
are high.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.700 align:middle line:84%
They're at risk for all
kinds of liver problems.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So just because
somebody looks thin

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.837 align:middle line:90%
doesn't mean they're healthy.

00:43:01.837 --> 00:43:03.170 align:middle line:90%
We certainly know that for sure.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>>GRACE: Yeah.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:05.262 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what if
somebody is going to say,

00:43:05.262 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to detox.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.290 align:middle line:84%
Under these circumstances, in
this conversation, what would

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:12.618 align:middle line:84%
you recommend that they make
sure is happening for them

00:43:12.618 --> 00:43:14.160 align:middle line:84%
before they would
begin such a thing.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.367 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, have a
microbiome assessment.

00:43:16.367 --> 00:43:17.450 align:middle line:90%
So glad you brought it up.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.700 align:middle line:84%
We actually have a
Master Gut Class.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.670 align:middle line:84%
It's at the
thegutinstitute.com/8blast.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.620 align:middle line:84%
We have eight modules, so 8
Blast to help the gut improve.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And we love a product.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Actually, they're here in
Colorado, called Quicksilver.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Quicksilver is an amazing
company, if you're not aware.

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, they have liver
tech kit called PushCatch.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So we detox with the
PushCatch, but we do it

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.380 align:middle line:84%
after we've really
worked on the gut a bit.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.518 align:middle line:84%
And the PushCatch
is very gentle.

00:43:44.518 --> 00:43:46.310 align:middle line:84%
There's a little liver
sauce, and something

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:90%
called ultrabinder.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.795 align:middle line:84%
I actually helper
to write up some

00:43:49.795 --> 00:43:51.920 align:middle line:84%
of the scientific background
about the ultrabinder.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.000 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And it binds microtoxins, as
well as mold, xenoestrogens.

00:43:57.060 --> 00:44:00.727 align:middle line:84%
The things that get caught
in the modern body they bind,

00:44:00.727 --> 00:44:03.310 align:middle line:84%
even the toxins that come out
of the gut flora that are toxic,

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.640 align:middle line:90%
bind them up a bit.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.190 align:middle line:84%
People generally feel really
great when they're taking it.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And heavy metals, it can
pull a bit of those out too.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:12.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fabulous.

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Fabulous to know.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.455 align:middle line:84%
And drinking lots of fluids,
and making sure always

00:44:15.455 --> 00:44:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that you're flushing
and flushing.

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:19.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, so probiotics,
actually you may not be aware,

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:23.210 align:middle line:84%
but I gave a keynote at
the Environmental Medicine

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:26.150 align:middle line:84%
Conference last year,
actually here in Colorado.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And several are bacteria,
which are also found

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:90%
in BIFIDO MAXIMUS probiotic.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.230 align:middle line:84%
Some of the species in there
are known to break down

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:36.080 align:middle line:90%
mycotoxins and glyphosate.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And these are common
now in our systems,

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.220 align:middle line:84%
even organic wine is
full of glyphosate,

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.790 align:middle line:84%
because our water
systems are contaminated.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:44.540 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Yes, and so
this is one of the ways

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that we're approaching
detoxing from glyphosate.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Unless someone goes
organic and has a detox system

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.390 align:middle line:90%
that's competent.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:middle line:84%
We actually do urine
testing for glyphosate

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.600 align:middle line:90%
for some of our clients.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Everyone's high.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Even if they've been
organic for 10, 20 years,

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.240 align:middle line:90%
believe it or not.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if
it's because they're

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.940 align:middle line:84%
missing the bacteria that
break down glyphosate,

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.398 align:middle line:84%
or they're still
somehow getting it

00:45:06.398 --> 00:45:08.190 align:middle line:84%
somewhere-- in the
air, water, or food.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's everywhere.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.147 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: It's in
restaurant foods.

00:45:10.147 --> 00:45:13.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we're trying to
find ways to eat, to live,

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.350 align:middle line:90%
that support the microbiome.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many
very popular approaches

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.180 align:middle line:84%
to dietary programs
for a variety

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.930 align:middle line:84%
of reasons, whether
it's health, or trying

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:25.160 align:middle line:84%
to lose weight, or maintain
some kind of balance.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Keto diet, paleo
diet, speak to us

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.450 align:middle line:90%
about what's happening there.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Long-term?

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Short-term?

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Do you recommend them?

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Yeah, I mean, I think
these diets are fatty in a way,

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:40.390 align:middle line:84%
even though I'm like
a big fan of several,

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and they seem to come
back every seven years.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:46.145 align:middle line:84%
So I think people really glom
onto because they're popular,

00:45:46.145 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:84%
because they're
looking for a solution.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Well we have so
many gut problems,

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:53.250 align:middle line:84%
and everyone's trying to
find an easy solution.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:54.300 align:middle line:90%
I don't blame them.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.130 align:middle line:84%
But all these diets
are very restrictive,

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:00.092 align:middle line:84%
and they do work temporarily
for a great majority of people.

00:46:00.092 --> 00:46:01.800 align:middle line:10%
But the problem is
they're so restricted,

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.680 align:middle line:10%
and when long-term
happens, it can actually

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:10%
damage the gut microbiome.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:06.920 align:middle line:90%
This is what I see.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Because when they
starve out bad flora,

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.850 align:middle line:84%
so that people have
less brain fog,

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:13.890 align:middle line:84%
and they do actually
lose weight a lot faster

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and burn fat better,
than often what I see

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.047 align:middle line:84%
is they start to see
health problems occur.

00:46:19.047 --> 00:46:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I've heard of many cases where
people develop a new autoimmune

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:middle line:84%
problem, or even
develop a cancer,

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.200 align:middle line:84%
while on a so-called
really healthy diet,

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.750 align:middle line:84%
whether it's keto, specific carb
diet, paleo diet, any diet--

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:33.510 align:middle line:84%
AIP, autoimmune paleo
diet-- any of them.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Or even vegan diet,
which is high fiber.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.272 align:middle line:84%
These are all really great
diets, but for a person,

00:46:39.272 --> 00:46:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and what their health goals
are, it may be very detrimental

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.650 align:middle line:90%
long term.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's always great
to do testing, testing

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.540 align:middle line:84%
before and after and making sure
the health goals are being met.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.162 align:middle line:84%
And I believe everyone
has some unique diet.

00:46:51.162 --> 00:46:53.620 align:middle line:84%
It probably has to do a little
bit with their ancestry too.

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.920 align:middle line:84%
If they're more
northern European,

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.280 align:middle line:84%
they probably can stand
less starches overall.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Some, but not a
ton all the time.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.390 align:middle line:90%
And if the more equatorial--

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm Asian, so my ancestors
were really dark skin.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.590 align:middle line:90%
We lived along the equator.

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And fruits and rice
are fine for us.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.690 align:middle line:90%
We're genetically adapted.

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:18.480 align:middle line:84%
I have certain genetics, like
the APOE alleles designate

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.730 align:middle line:84%
the E4s associated with
lot more Alzheimer's,

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.730 align:middle line:84%
and carb intolerance,
and diabetes.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:26.790 align:middle line:10%
So if someone's E4, they're
more usually northern hemisphere

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:30.750 align:middle line:10%
adapted, and they live
away from the equator.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.880 align:middle line:10%
They're not so dark
as me, and they don't

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.010 align:middle line:10%
eat as many grains and fruits.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:84%
So we look at many
things that may

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:40.000 align:middle line:84%
make what a perfect diet
might be for an individual,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.240 align:middle line:90%
but it can vary I believe.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I
like about diet, is

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.570 align:middle line:84%
that we can change
it and then quickly--

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.850 align:middle line:84%
so my microbiome study
showed in just one meal

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.170 align:middle line:90%
we can shift our microbiome.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Dr. Grace, where
can people learn more

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.650 align:middle line:90%
about what you have to say?

00:47:55.650 --> 00:47:57.390 align:middle line:10%
>>GRACE: I'm at the
thegutinstitute.com,

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.370 align:middle line:10%
and we have also an
active Facebook page.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:02.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm on there often,
Tuesday 2:00 o'clock live,

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:04.260 align:middle line:10%
to answer questions,
and talk a little bit

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.520 align:middle line:10%
about some subject I love.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.562 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Thank you so much
for being with us today.

00:48:07.562 --> 00:48:09.780 align:middle line:84%
It is amazing how
deeply we can dive down

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.860 align:middle line:84%
the rabbit hole regarding the
microbiome, and the system,

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.050 align:middle line:84%
and how important it is in our
overall health, and wellness,

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:17.850 align:middle line:90%
and well-being.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:18.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GRACE: Oh, thank you
so much for having me on.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:20.820 align:middle line:90%
Such an honor.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:21.620 align:middle line:90%
Thank you Dr. Sue.

clinicians, researchers,
patients, and even MMA fighters

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:33.150 align:middle line:84%
into looking deeper into their
portfolio of microorganisms,

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.820 align:middle line:84%
which live in,
on, and around us.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.330 align:middle line:84%
She's bringing the latest
biome research to the stage.

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:41.040 align:middle line:10%
This information
is a game-changer

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.740 align:middle line:10%
for balancing hormone
