00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.350 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: In my last
conversation with Dr. Edward

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
Group, we spoke about
the consequences

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:84%
of allowing our colons to
become clogged up and toxic.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820 align:middle line:10%
In this conversation, we discuss
where some of those toxins

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:10%
come from, the
hidden sources that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.390 align:middle line:10%
are in our diet and
our home environment.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Group has done tremendous
amounts of research in his role

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:10%
as a health advocate,
which you're

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.130 align:middle line:10%
about to become
the beneficiary of.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.780 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us again.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.920 align:middle line:84%
We barely got rolling in
our first conversation.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.959 align:middle line:84%
I think most people were
left with their jaws dropped

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
at the amount of information--
I mean, meaningful information--

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
you were giving them,
including information

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
that is often hidden
from our view.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.500 align:middle line:90%
And I love the way you dig.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:90%
You dig.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So toward that end, let's
continue our conversation.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But now we're going to look at
how our bodies become so toxic

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
and the ways in which
we're bringing them in.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't really talk
a whole lot about food

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890 align:middle line:84%
in the last one and
GMOs and organic

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.830 align:middle line:84%
and what that really
means these days.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's just begin
the conversation

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
with some of the worst
offenders in terms

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
of dumping loads of
toxins into the body.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:10%
>>DR. EDWARD GROUP, III:
Well, everybody has to eat.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:10%
So that's obviously one of
the biggest sources of toxins.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:10%
I mean, just imagine a
general average person

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.180 align:middle line:10%
who gets up in the morning,
doesn't drink water, eats

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.015 align:middle line:10%
bacon, biscuits, gravy.

00:01:58.015 --> 00:01:58.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I can tell you're from Texas.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.450 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Pancakes.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.557 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yeah.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty much
what they eat.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in Texas they'll even
have a steak for breakfast,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.886 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:06.025 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:06.774 align:middle line:90%
Chicken-fried.

00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So in the
morning though,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.398 align:middle line:84%
really-- because your body
goes through three cycles.

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:14.580 align:middle line:84%
It goes through an elimination
cycle in the morning.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:84%
It goes through an appropriation
cycle in the afternoon.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.250 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through
an absorption cycle,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.010 align:middle line:84%
which really uses the nutrients
from the day to absorb

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:90%
and then appropriate.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And then at nighttime, when
your body heals itself,

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.100 align:middle line:84%
when you're supposed to
be getting a good eight

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.510 align:middle line:84%
hours of rest
every night, that's

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.250 align:middle line:84%
when it pushes everything
out, all the toxins.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.710 align:middle line:84%
In the morning, you should have
a healthy breakfast of nothing

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
but fruit, first of
all, because fruit

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:84%
is water, fiber,
minerals, nutrients,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
everything that your body
wants and needs to push out

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.960 align:middle line:84%
all the toxins from
the night before.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.200 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.870 align:middle line:84%
One little question
on that before you

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.000 align:middle line:90%
continue that discourse.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.497 align:middle line:84%
What about people that,
say, have high blood sugar?

00:02:58.497 --> 00:03:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, should they be eating
fruit in the morning, too?

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: They should because--
that's a controversial subject.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.625 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Fruit
contains fructose.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.600 align:middle line:84%
As long as you don't have
anything else in your stomach

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:84%
for 20 minutes, about the time
it takes for fruit to digest,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:90%
you're OK with that.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
The problem why fruit
spikes high blood sugar

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.052 align:middle line:84%
is usually because people
will have that breakfast,

00:03:20.052 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and then they'll eat
a fruit cup with it.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.785 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll eat
fruit with yogurt,

00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:25.940 align:middle line:84%
or they'll eat fruit
and then have some milk.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Or they'll eat fruit
with something else.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you mix fruit
with another compound,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.885 align:middle line:84%
then you're going
to have that glucose

00:03:33.885 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
or you're going to have
that blood sugar spike.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.090 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.610 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.470 align:middle line:84%
So no one's really
a risk to do this.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.710 align:middle line:90%
So continue on.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So we put just clean, fresh
fruit-- organic-- in the body.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.730 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And that supports
the elimination cycle.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:84%
And then don't eat anything
for 20, 30 minutes after that.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you could have
your normal breakfast.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
Of course, I don't recommend
eating a breakfast like what

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:84%
we talked about with
steak and everything,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
because what it's going to
do is clog you up even more.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Those are going to
be the contributing

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:90%
toxins to that day.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
You're starting off your
day with unhealthy food,

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.700 align:middle line:84%
or some people on the
way to work go and get

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.870 align:middle line:84%
a fast food for
breakfast in the morning.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So you have processed,
cooked, microwaved,

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.150 align:middle line:90%
genetically modified.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
The meat in the steak is
probably has hormones in it.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.960 align:middle line:84%
The cattle was schizophrenic
at the time of butchering,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:90%
which goes into the meat.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:84%
You have all the vaccines
that have gone into the meat.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
You have all kinds of
substances that have gone in.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.410 align:middle line:84%
Then the meat is
usually sprayed to keep

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.134 align:middle line:84%
it looking red and everything
with all kinds of chemicals.

00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:36.550 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well,
let's say you just

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.725 align:middle line:84%
go for a venti vanilla
latte for breakfast.

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:42.055 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, then,
after you eat all that,

00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
then you stop in for
your venti vanilla latte.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you end up
with a bunch of sugar

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of coffee that
is sprayed with pesticides.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
big, huge difference

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
between organic food
and nonorganic food.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And what I tell
people, the first thing

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
you need to do when
you change anything,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate the majority of
toxins coming into your body

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.110 align:middle line:84%
is to switch from regular
food to organic food.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Even though the
standards still aren't

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.750 align:middle line:84%
quite where we want to
see them for organic,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.140 align:middle line:84%
they still have to be
grown without pesticides

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:84%
and without a lot of chemicals
and fertilizers and meat

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.530 align:middle line:84%
without hormones and
antibiotics, in the range.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The cattles have
to be range fed.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So you're still making
a tremendous difference.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.900 align:middle line:84%
Even if you were
to take all that

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.530 align:middle line:84%
stuff I just talked about
and then ate all that stuff

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.600 align:middle line:84%
organically, you've
probably reduced your toxins

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.730 align:middle line:84%
from food on a daily
basis from-- let's say

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.550 align:middle line:84%
before you had a million toxins
from food on a daily basis.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.824 align:middle line:84%
You've probably
reduced it to 100,000,

00:05:42.824 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
which is a significant
difference.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.948 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:05:44.948 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
A 90% reduction just
by going organic?

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: 90% reduction
just by going organic.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's huge.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.498 align:middle line:90%
And that's easy enough to do.

00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:54.940 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of people
say, well, you know,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.074 align:middle line:90%
I have a couple kids.

00:05:56.074 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm on a fixed
salary, and I can't

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:90%
afford to eat organically.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And that is a big
argument for some people.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:84%
What is your countervailing
argument on that?

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.890 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: It is a big argument.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.114 align:middle line:84%
What I usually tell
people to do is

00:06:09.114 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:84%
you just can't put a
price tag on your health.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.900 align:middle line:84%
If don't buy those
$100 pair of shoes

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
that you would
normally buy or start

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
looking at some of the things
that you're spending money on--

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.645 align:middle line:90%
analyze your finances.

00:06:21.645 --> 00:06:23.020 align:middle line:84%
See what you're
spending money on

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:84%
that you really don't need
that you can cut back on.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.410 align:middle line:84%
If you cut down on those
$4 lattes every month,

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.950 align:middle line:84%
you have an extra couple hundred
dollars for organic food.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.070 align:middle line:84%
If you cut down on that
toxic makeup or you cut down

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
on the toxic
hairdress-- you know,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.764 align:middle line:84%
hair people that are doing your
hair or-- there's always things

00:06:42.764 --> 00:06:43.305 align:middle line:90%
you can cut--

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:44.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You're saying
it's not negotiable.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to eat
organic food if you're

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.961 align:middle line:84%
going to start
cleaning out the body,

00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:90%
and so find ways to do it.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.754 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:06:49.754 --> 00:06:50.920 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Find ways to do it.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And start making your body and
your health a first priority,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.710 align:middle line:84%
because you're going to enjoy so
many more things when you have

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.621 align:middle line:84%
more energy to do things, to
spend with your kids, when you

00:07:02.621 --> 00:07:05.120 align:middle line:84%
have energy at night to spend
with your husband or whatever.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing would be to
shift over to organic foods.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you mentioned--
you just kind of touched on it,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to
ask you about this.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.991 align:middle line:84%
The organic standards
have changed,

00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:15.615 align:middle line:84%
and some people are
concerned about it.

00:07:15.615 --> 00:07:17.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you see these
bogus reports that

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.400 align:middle line:84%
have come out about, oh,
there's no difference

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:84%
nutritionally between--
they have the same vitamins

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and minerals whether it's
organic or inorganic.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.500 align:middle line:84%
This came out just
a few months ago.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's very
frustrating, I think,

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.344 align:middle line:84%
for people who don't really
know the subject well

00:07:31.344 --> 00:07:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and are trying to find
out the truth about it.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what is
true just on that argument,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:84%
about the synergistic effects
that are completely lost

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.420 align:middle line:84%
once you're going to
commercial produce,

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.940 align:middle line:84%
and then also about the
statutes themselves,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
because now we see a lot
of produce in Walmart.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:84%
And my understanding
is Walmart has also

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
driven some of the
legislation, and get

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.260 align:middle line:84%
into some of those nuances so
we know what we're getting.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, with any
new type of a standard,

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.460 align:middle line:84%
you're always going
to have questions.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that I don't
like about the organic program

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.110 align:middle line:84%
is that they still allow certain
synthetic chemicals to be

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.010 align:middle line:84%
in the foods, like titanium
dioxide and certain type

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:90%
of colorings.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And scientifically
proven ingredients

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that are synthetic that people
have had side effects by using

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.890 align:middle line:84%
are still allowed in
the organic programs.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that what the
organic programs have done

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:90%
have been incredible.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've come
to a certain point.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.120 align:middle line:90%
And it's educated the masses.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.070 align:middle line:84%
It's given us, really,
the opportunity

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.874 align:middle line:90%
to eat better foods.

00:08:42.874 --> 00:08:46.110 align:middle line:84%
The farmers, you know,
the farmers are--

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.564 align:middle line:84%
some farmers are not
following the guidelines.

00:08:48.564 --> 00:08:49.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that's a problem.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But you still have
situations that

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.273 align:middle line:84%
arise with any type of
industry that you're

00:08:54.273 --> 00:08:55.356 align:middle line:90%
going to have bad or good.

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:56.970 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
bad chiropractors.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have good
chiropractors, bad massage

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:58.990 align:middle line:90%
therapists.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's always
going to be there, but--

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really knowing
your source is important,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:90%
especially growing locally.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.268 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Knowing your source.

00:09:03.268 --> 00:09:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's easy to
do now, because you

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.780 align:middle line:84%
can contact the person that--
the certification agency

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
that that farm comes from.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
You can see their
records over the years,

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.770 align:middle line:90%
if they had any violations.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:16.890 align:middle line:84%
So knowing your source,
tracing it back.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.020 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I
tell people to do

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:90%
is start finding local co-ops.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.010 align:middle line:84%
Start finding and supporting
your local farmers.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.630 align:middle line:84%
You can actually go
visit those farms,

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.220 align:middle line:84%
and you made a point
about how expensive it

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:90%
is in the cutbacks.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.660 align:middle line:84%
In Houston we have co-ops over
there where we get shares.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:84%
And most cities you can
find farmers' markets,

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
or you can find
somebody doing shares.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Or you can contact farmers
surrounding the area

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.490 align:middle line:84%
and start developing
relationships with them.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:51.860 align:middle line:84%
One thing I don't like about the
major organic food stores that

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
are out there and a lot
of the places where you're

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle line:84%
able to buy organic
foods is they

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.372 align:middle line:84%
have to be picked
before they're ripe,

00:10:00.372 --> 00:10:01.663 align:middle line:90%
and they have to be shipped in.

00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And that can take two weeks,
sometimes three weeks.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And they allow
them to ripen over

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:84%
the period of the
boat ride coming in.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.566 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Might that
have something to do with

00:10:11.566 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
the studies saying
in nutrients-- i.e,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.250 align:middle line:84%
just the vitamins
and mineral content--

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.720 align:middle line:84%
might be similar because
neither one have vine-ripened,

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.670 align:middle line:90%
for example, or--

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.420 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: It might.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.020 align:middle line:84%
But really, what you're going
to find is the life force.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.320 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.820 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: The life
force and the energy

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.672 align:middle line:84%
that live food gives you--
I mean, if you pick--

00:10:28.672 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
and that's going back to what
we were talking about before,

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
is going back to
what we really should

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
have is each individual family
having their own little garden

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.356 align:middle line:90%
at their house.

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
You could even do it in
apartments these days

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:90%
on the balconies.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's ways to
have and grow your own food.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And that way, you're putting
your own energy into it.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting
the highest level out.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly like the animals.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.460 align:middle line:84%
You pick it and you ate it,
and you get the highest energy.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And the flavor
is so much better.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.040 align:middle line:84%
Another one of the
services I really like

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.690 align:middle line:84%
are the community-supported
agriculture programs

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
where you subscribe
for $20 or $30 a week.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And you have
brought to you a box

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.530 align:middle line:84%
of beautiful freshly
picked produce, a variety.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:84%
You're eating in the
seasons from a local farm.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.980 align:middle line:84%
We're lucky in that we live
not far from a biodynamic farm

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.140 align:middle line:90%
near the Rudolf Steiner garden.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is
really another way

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.000 align:middle line:84%
to do it if you don't have
the time or space or desire

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.545 align:middle line:90%
to do your own gardening.

00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: That's
the way to do it,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.506 align:middle line:84%
because you're
getting local food.

00:11:33.506 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:90%
It's just like honey.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You want to buy your honey
local or from a local farm

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.665 align:middle line:84%
so you can get the
proper nutrients.

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:40.915 align:middle line:84%
And you can get the proper
immune-stimulating benefits

00:11:40.915 --> 00:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
of that honey,
because those bees

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:44.500 align:middle line:90%
are in your same environment.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:84%
It all goes back to the
environment that you're in.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Like what Bruce
Lipton talks about.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
It's not that genes cause
disease or anything.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the environment in
which you put yourself

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.280 align:middle line:90%
in that causes disease.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.020 align:middle line:84%
If you adapt to your
environment and you put yourself

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:03.890 align:middle line:84%
in a clean environment
or you keep yourself

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
in a clean environment,
that's what your body wants.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
your body adapts to.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.305 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: So absolutely.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:90%
100%.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It would be-- find
those local co-ops.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.179 align:middle line:84%
Find people that are growing
food in your local community.

00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:17.970 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Go to your
local farmers' market.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, one thing we
talked about off camera

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.784 align:middle line:84%
was that oftentimes, even
those-- well, not so much

00:12:24.784 --> 00:12:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the local small farms where
you have your own spring water

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.240 align:middle line:84%
or well, but a lot of the
larger organic operations

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
are still using city
water supplies that

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
are loaded with-- well, you tell
us what they're loaded with.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: The water in
the city-- the city tap

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.260 align:middle line:84%
water is a big problem
for organic certification.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I like, too, about--
you mentioned biodynamic.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:90%
That would be a step up.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.880 align:middle line:84%
Biodynamic is going
to be the new organic,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
because there's
higher guidelines.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And the plants are
picked according

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.230 align:middle line:84%
to the moon cycles
and everything else.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You grow
that way, don't you?

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: We do do biodynamic.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.000 align:middle line:90%
We're certified organic.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.790 align:middle line:84%
But we grow according
permaculture, sustainability--

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excellent.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --and
biodynamic farming.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
But one of the
problems that I have

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.550 align:middle line:84%
with the organic farming and
the organic certification

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that a
lot of organic farms

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.660 align:middle line:84%
are still using tap
water, city tap water.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
contaminated, depending

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
where you are, with radiation,
with arsenic, chlorine,

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.449 align:middle line:84%
fluoride, prescription
drug residue.

>>GROUP: Hormones.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just all kinds of

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.140 align:middle line:84%
that's falling into
the water supply.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:41.530 align:middle line:84%
So all of those chemicals are
getting into the water supply,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:84%
and the plants
are uptaking them.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's altering the growth.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
It's reducing
the-- probably they

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.964 align:middle line:84%
might have tested the plants
from organic, the minerals.

00:13:50.964 --> 00:13:52.630 align:middle line:84%
It can affect the
mineral concentration.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.740 align:middle line:84%

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
or-- there's just no way
you're going to find anything

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:84%
conventional

Krakow and his technology and

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:84%
as you say, the life force

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.760 align:middle line:84%
coming from organic
versus commercial

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:90%
is like night and day.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.650 align:middle line:84%
There's almost no life
force in the commercial.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And our body is
light and energy.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, of course, it's
not really a match.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:90%
It's dead.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%

>>REGINA: And enhance

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: It's really the
energy in the food that's

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:90%
the most important part.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.831 align:middle line:84%
It's not the protein
and the minerals

00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:15.080 align:middle line:90%
and the vitamins and all that.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Those play an important
role, but it's really

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.190 align:middle line:90%
the energy source of the food.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.410 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.659 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about-- we're
going to move through-- we

00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:22.984 align:middle line:90%
have a lot to talk about here.

00:15:22.984 --> 00:15:24.400 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
what happens when

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:84%
you take that beautiful organic
produce that is eminating

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
this life force, maybe
even biodynamically grown.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:84%
And you stuff it in the
microwave, and you nuke it.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.270 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, not
only the microwave,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
but the radiation in
general is a major issue.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what happens when
you put food in a microwave

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.900 align:middle line:84%
is it alters-- it heats
from the inside out.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And it alters the
molecules, because it

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
sends radiotrophic
signals through there.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And as it heats,
it actually tears

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.050 align:middle line:84%
through the vitamins
and the minerals.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.383 align:middle line:90%
And it basically nukes the food.

00:15:55.383 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So number one, it completely
kills the life force.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Number two, it rearranges
the molecular structure

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.180 align:middle line:84%
of the vitamins and
the compounds in there.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.970 align:middle line:84%
For example, like
calcium might have

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:90%
two carbon chains over here.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And what might happen is when
the nuclear radiation comes

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.320 align:middle line:84%
in there, it might cut through
those chains of the calcium.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
So you have little pieces
of calcium in there

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:22.700 align:middle line:84%
which the body doesn't
know what to do with.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:84%
When you eat microwaved food
or you drink anything that's

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.580 align:middle line:84%
been in the microwave,
all you're doing

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.590 align:middle line:84%
is putting complete toxic
things in your system.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.690 align:middle line:84%
You might put some macaroni
and cheese in the microwave.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.042 align:middle line:84%
When it comes out, it smells
like macaroni and cheese

00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and looks like
macaroni and cheese.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.182 align:middle line:84%
But really what is is just
toxic compound that your body--

00:16:44.182 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
your body-- yeah.

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: It doesn't
know what to do with

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.230 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't know how
to break down properly

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't know
how to use properly.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And you might get full from it,
but really what it's causing

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:84%
is it's causing continued
damage in your system.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's causing your immune
system to fight extra hard,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's causing all
your energy stores

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.200 align:middle line:84%
to process and break
down that food.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.089 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't have
any way to utilize it.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.849 align:middle line:84%
So the microwave is
one of the things--

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:84%
one of the first
things I tell people

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.319 align:middle line:84%
to do when we go in
their homes and evaluate

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
their homes for the
toxins in their house,

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:84%
because really if you think
about it, if you look back

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to the doctors that were in the
1920s and the doctors that were

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.650 align:middle line:84%
in the 1930s, when
a patient came in,

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:84%
they would spend hours with them
evaluating their whole life,

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:84%
evaluating the relationship,
evaluating what they ate.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the good ones would
go to the patient's home

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.499 align:middle line:84%
and look through the
home and say, OK, yeah.

00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:84%
This might be causing
you to have problems.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.090 align:middle line:84%
This might be causing
you to have problems.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.420 align:middle line:84%
We had a cancer patient one
time that had testicular cancer.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.299 align:middle line:90%
He was 18 years old.

00:17:52.299 --> 00:17:52.840 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: 18.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And nobody could
figure out what was going on.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And we went to his house, and
there was a major fault line

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.305 align:middle line:84%
right where he was sleeping
on his bed coming up

00:18:01.305 --> 00:18:03.180 align:middle line:84%
from the earth right
where his testicles were

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that were putting out--
that was putting out

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.535 align:middle line:84%
massive amounts of
geopathic stress.

00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And what it was, he was
sleeping right there.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And those energy fields were
coming up and completely

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:18.192 align:middle line:84%
altering the way the
electromagnetic system works

00:18:18.192 --> 00:18:19.775 align:middle line:84%
in your body, because
your body's just

00:18:19.775 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:90%
an electromagnetic system.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's why radiation
is such a damaging thing

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.982 align:middle line:84%
right now that
we're dealing with,

00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:84%
not only in microwaves, but
with cell phones and cell phone

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.430 align:middle line:84%
towers, even the
mattresses in your home

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:90%
with the coils in them.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
The metal under the
bras act as conductors

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.600 align:middle line:84%
for women instituting
breast cancer.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
CT scans, TSA scanners
at the airport.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you name it.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:90%
Cell phones.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything is going
towards us being

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.367 align:middle line:84%
radiated with
damaging radiation.

00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:52.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I'm glad
you brought that up

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
about the natural
geopathic stress as well.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.870 align:middle line:84%
I have a viewer, a
long-time viewer, of-- well,

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.040 align:middle line:84%
back when I was still
CMN, before Gaiam,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.100 align:middle line:84%
for years has been
writing to me saying,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
you have to cover the topic of
geopathic stress on the body

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.797 align:middle line:84%
and sent me a couple
of wonderful books.

00:19:09.797 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:90%
The authors were deceased.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So let me just ask
you, who are some

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
of the top people
in that field right

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.207 align:middle line:90%
now that can explain it well?

00:19:17.207 --> 00:19:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Gosh.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Do you know?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: I don't even

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.010 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:20.940 align:middle line:84%
We'll talk about
that later, but I

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.140 align:middle line:84%
think it's a subject worth
covering in and of itself.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:90%
It sounds like--

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.210 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: It is a great
subject to cover.

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
We will get into that
more in the future.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: I mean, it
does exist, I mean,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:90%
depending on where you are.

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:32.079 align:middle line:84%
It's just alterations in
the electromagnetic field.

00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:90%
We will get to it.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And I was going
to say, before we

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.510 align:middle line:84%
leave the subject
of the microwave,

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.400 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading a
study about someone

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.515 align:middle line:84%
who was experimenting
with house plants.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:43.449 align:middle line:90%

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:49.210 align:middle line:84%
They watered the certain group
of class with microwaved water.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And those things were
dead within, what, a week?

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:54.402 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: They were dead within
like a week or seven days

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.360 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:55.859 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:55.859 --> 00:19:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so what was
happening there to actually

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.940 align:middle line:84%
kill the plant just
with the nuked water?

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, when you
nuke it, you kill it.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.350 align:middle line:90%
You kill the life force in it.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Water is a living
substance, too.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.630 align:middle line:84%
Every living substance
on the planet

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
is composed of at
least 80% water.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.220 align:middle line:90%
Plants.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.270 align:middle line:84%
The Earth itself is
composed of 80% water.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.090 align:middle line:84%
Trees, the human being, all
animals, every living thing

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.600 align:middle line:90%
is composed of 80% water.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And water changes
structure and function

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:90%
with Masaru Emoto's research.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.420 align:middle line:10%
You can think love in the
water and take an image of it,

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.660 align:middle line:10%
and it'll be a crystalline.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:10%
You can think something
negative into water,

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:10%
and it will change the
structure and function of it.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: So when you
nuke it, I can't imagine.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:10%
Has anyone looked at it?

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.150 align:middle line:10%
>>GROUP: When you
nuke it, you've

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.400 align:middle line:10%
completely changed the
structure of the water

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.580 align:middle line:10%
from being in a
crystalline semiconductor

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.530 align:middle line:10%
state into a negative state,
which actually might cause harm

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:49.680 align:middle line:10%
for you and the body.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.460 align:middle line:84%
They used a microwave
temporarily in hospitals

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.504 align:middle line:90%
to warm blood.

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And when they put the
blood into people,

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:90%
it actually killed the people.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.270 align:middle line:84%
So they learned
real fast that they

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.284 align:middle line:84%
weren't able to use
microwaves to heat up blood.

00:21:02.284 --> 00:21:02.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:02.825 --> 00:21:04.270 align:middle line:90%
I think we've got that one down.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.075 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: If it does that, think
what it does to your food.

00:21:08.075 --> 00:21:08.825 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Exactly.

00:21:08.825 --> 00:21:10.790 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So throw
out your microwave

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:14.230 align:middle line:84%
and replace it with a convection
oven or a far infrared oven,

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.090 align:middle line:84%
something that's going
to heat naturally

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:22.010 align:middle line:84%
or just use nontoxic
heating equipment.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Teflon is extremely dangerous
to use when you're heating.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.660 align:middle line:84%
If you have a bird
in the next room

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and you're cooking
in a Teflon pan,

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that bird will die because of
the fumes from the Teflon pans

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:90%
even up to 300 feet away.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.441 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I was
going to get to that.

00:21:39.441 --> 00:21:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, we can do that now
and then get back to GMOs.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.785 align:middle line:84%
That is another element, the
what we cook our food in.

00:21:44.785 --> 00:21:48.300 align:middle line:84%
So Teflon, you can
expand on that, aluminum.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Even copper, even when you
have high-end cookware where

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.446 align:middle line:84%
you've kind of scratched
through after years

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:57.360 align:middle line:84%
of the stainless steel and
you end up down to the copper

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.590 align:middle line:84%
level, some pretty
bad stuff can happen.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.700 align:middle line:90%
So talk about that, cookware.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:07.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Teflon cookware, a
lot of the just metal cookware,

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.497 align:middle line:84%
which is a combination
of nickel--

00:22:09.497 --> 00:22:11.330 align:middle line:84%
it can be a combination
of nickel, aluminum.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.996 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's the
cheap stuff usually

00:22:12.996 --> 00:22:14.880 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: All that
stuff can be toxic,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:90%
especially when you scrape it.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.572 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
we recommend is

00:22:17.572 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:84%
you get rid of all your
cookware and replace it

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.080 align:middle line:84%
with like Le Creuset
or nontoxic cookware.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.902 align:middle line:90%
Xtrema is another brand.

00:22:23.902 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about just
plain stainless, just

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.651 align:middle line:90%
high-end stainless?

00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: You can do
stainless, but still the--

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.572 align:middle line:84%
what we try to say is there
are some ceramic ones that

00:22:31.572 --> 00:22:33.030 align:middle line:84%
are out there that
are really good.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Stainless you can
do, but even they're

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:84%
mixing nickel and stuff
in with stainless.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And some of the
cheaper stainless you

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:90%
have to watch out for.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Even some of the
stainless is even coated,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.680 align:middle line:84%
so you have to
watch out for that.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about those
new high-end nonsticks

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.250 align:middle line:84%
out of Denmark that
are really expensive,

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:53.209 align:middle line:84%
that supposedly can't
scratch and are nontoxic?

00:22:53.209 --> 00:22:53.833 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Right.

00:22:53.833 --> 00:22:56.030 align:middle line:84%
They have like that
diamonds coating on them.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:84%
Those are supposed to be OK,
but I haven't had any research

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.937 align:middle line:84%
coming up and saying yes
one way or the other.

00:23:02.937 --> 00:23:04.353 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you
like the ceramic,

00:23:04.353 --> 00:23:05.760 align:middle line:90%
like Le Creuset or something?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yes.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.909 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That's
your preferred one.

00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:90%
So be really careful.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.680 align:middle line:84%
If it's super
cheap, you probably

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.320 align:middle line:84%
have some stuff
leaking out in it.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And I, at one
point, ruined a pan.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:19.035 align:middle line:84%
I overused it, and I was
eating off of exposed copper.

00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:21.535 align:middle line:84%
And I know that that can cause
a lot of problems, especially

00:23:21.535 --> 00:23:23.017 align:middle line:90%
with your brain chemistry.

00:23:23.017 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to be careful
about that one as well.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Now let's go back to
the subject of GMOs.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:90%
I want to get into that.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.860 align:middle line:90%
That's really misunderstood.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: The subject of GMOs is
a way for the big companies--

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto especially-- to be
able to regulate and control

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:90%
our food supply.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.600 align:middle line:84%
The way that the government
industrial complex

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.580 align:middle line:84%
works is they want to
regulate health care.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:84%
They want to
regulate agriculture.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
They want to
regulate oil and gas.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They want to regulate all the
commodities and everything

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:84%
that we need on a
regular basis to survive.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that they
haven't been able to do

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.570 align:middle line:84%
is to patent herbs or
oxygen or water or something

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.660 align:middle line:90%
that's grown naturally.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.830 align:middle line:84%
So Monsanto, in conglomeration
with Cargill and many other

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:15.430 align:middle line:84%
industrial food companies, all
the main-- Nabisco, PepsiCo,

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.470 align:middle line:90%
all those companies--

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.511 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Who own more
than 90% of the seedstock.

00:24:18.511 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: All the food
and all the seedstock.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And if you go into a
grocery store, most of it's

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.860 align:middle line:90%
owned by less than 10 companies.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: They all
formed together

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:34.730 align:middle line:84%
to create a system to where they
could patent wheat, soybean,

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.440 align:middle line:84%
corn, all the things
that we utilize

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.320 align:middle line:90%
the majority of in commodities.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
So what they started doing
was changing the genetic code

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and modifying those to be
resistant against pesticides

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.900 align:middle line:84%
or resistant against
certain types of bugs

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:56.590 align:middle line:84%
or that would yield more
fruit or yield more wheat.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:middle line:10%
But the catch is you would
have to replant the seeds.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.500 align:middle line:10%
So basically you would have
to buy the seeds from them

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.750 align:middle line:10%
every single year to replant.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:10%
And what they did
was they drove around

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:11.000 align:middle line:10%
with 18-wheelers spreading
seeds all the way

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.320 align:middle line:10%
across-- their seeds all
the way across the country.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.905 align:middle line:84%
So even if their seeds ended
up in somebody else's farmland

00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that didn't want
to use them, they

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.820 align:middle line:84%
would come and collect
and take samples--

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Monsanto would take samples
and then sue these farmers.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, I know.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.160 align:middle line:90%
These are notorious lawsuits.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And these lawsuits
have been going on.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.680 align:middle line:84%
These farmers have been
put out of business.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The whole goal was to put
all the small farmers out

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.050 align:middle line:84%
of business, and they've
pretty much accomplished that.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.380 align:middle line:84%
The research that we dug into
that we've just figured out

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.739 align:middle line:84%
recently to connect the
chemtrails from the aluminum

00:25:46.739 --> 00:25:48.155 align:middle line:84%
and everything
from the chemtrails

00:25:48.155 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
that they're spraying down
to ruin the agriculture

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.630 align:middle line:84%
and to get in the water
supply, well, we just

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.490 align:middle line:84%
found out that Monsanto
has been working

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:84%
on a genetically modified crop
to be resistant against metals,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.610 align:middle line:84%
aluminum in
particular, and barium.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:06.410 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.330 align:middle line:90%
It's sick.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're talking
about something

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that is a gift of nature.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.510 align:middle line:90%
As you say, not patentable.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And if you can patent it,
destroy the rest of nature,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.000 align:middle line:84%
you absolutely control
the food supply

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.620 align:middle line:84%
of the planet, which
means you can also

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.680 align:middle line:84%
control who gets
what, what amounts.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is really has
dastardly implications.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: I mean, and it's
also-- it's hard to say this,

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.860 align:middle line:84%
because there is a population
control agenda, because there's

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.630 align:middle line:90%
too many people on Earth.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.360 align:middle line:84%
The studies that have been
done with mice in the labs

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.440 align:middle line:84%
with being fed genetically
modified foods-- if the food is

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.790 align:middle line:84%
not able to reseed
itself, it's not

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.120 align:middle line:90%
able to create another life.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.920 align:middle line:84%
Those mice are my dying
within half their lifespan,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.990 align:middle line:84%
or within one generation
they're completely eliminated.

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.980 align:middle line:84%
So what you have, when you
go into the grocery store,

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
you have 90% of that stuff
is genetically modified.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.390 align:middle line:84%
All the people out
there drinking diet

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.710 align:middle line:84%
drinks-- Aspartame is
genetically modified.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the tomatoes, if
they're not-- organic foods

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:90%
are not genetically modified.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.830 align:middle line:84%
So that's one good
thing right there.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.250 align:middle line:84%
But you have the majority of
soy, the majority of squash,

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.740 align:middle line:84%
the majority of corn--
what's made from corn?

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.650 align:middle line:90%
High fructose corn syrup.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.580 align:middle line:90%
What's made from soy?

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.670 align:middle line:90%
Soy lecithin.

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.742 align:middle line:90%
Pick up any label--

00:27:31.742 --> 00:27:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Any packaged product.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: -- that you can find,
and you're going to find soy

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:90%
in it.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find some
sort of a corn product in it.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.650 align:middle line:84%
They're hiding it under all
these other ingredients,

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
but the majority of stuff
that you're going to find

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.990 align:middle line:84%
and that you're
going to eat is going

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to be genetically modified.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you don't want,
because your system does not

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:56.100 align:middle line:84%
know how to process a
genetically modified food

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:57.820 align:middle line:90%
source or ingredient.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So if we're
looking at life force,

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
as we were a moment ago, and
you have an heirloom seed that

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.170 align:middle line:84%
can replicate its own
life season after season

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.570 align:middle line:84%
after season and
produce new seeds

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:13.240 align:middle line:84%
and you're looking at these
terminator seeds by Monsanto,

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.310 align:middle line:84%
what would we be looking
at in life force?

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:21.390 align:middle line:84%
If the rats are dying at half
the normal rate of lifespan,

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:23.360 align:middle line:90%
what are we looking at there?

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.540 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in terms
of the genetics,

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:30.675 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the life force,
what's happened to those seeds?

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:32.570 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Those seeds
have been created

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:38.035 align:middle line:84%
to drain life force
from a living substance.

00:28:38.035 --> 00:28:39.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So when
they're working

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory
creating these seeds,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.732 align:middle line:84%
they're devitalizing them, I
assume, on a number of levels?

00:28:45.732 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, the
strange thing is

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.060 align:middle line:84%
they have different
scientists working.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.041 align:middle line:84%
So even the scientists
sometimes don't even

00:28:51.041 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:90%
know what they're doing.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: This scientist
might be saying, OK,

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:02.410 align:middle line:84%
my job is to work on creating
this genetic modification

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:84%
that's going to make this
plant resistant to Roundup.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:07.710 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And then it goes
to the next scientist,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.200 align:middle line:84%
and this scientist's
job is to make

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.735 align:middle line:84%
this plant resistant to
a certain type of bug

00:29:17.735 --> 00:29:18.780 align:middle line:90%

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.670 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
what they're doing

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and the long-term effects.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.390 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, we
don't even know, really,

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.480 align:middle line:90%
the long-term effects.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.080 align:middle line:84%
We know it's bad, and we know
the body can't react to it.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.788 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And we know
the rats are dying.

00:29:30.788 --> 00:29:33.220 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And we know that it
decreases your life force.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:35.960 align:middle line:84%
You can hold a genetically
modified tomato

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.257 align:middle line:84%
and take a Kirlian
photograph before and after,

00:29:39.257 --> 00:29:40.340 align:middle line:90%
and you have a life force.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And then you're holding
the tomato in your hand,

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.409 align:middle line:90%
and your life force goes down.

00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:46.741 align:middle line:90%
That's interesting.

00:29:46.741 --> 00:29:48.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's already been done?

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.263 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: That's been done.

00:29:49.263 --> 00:29:50.700 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.680 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: But there's
still not-- we're

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.510 align:middle line:84%
coming into a quantum age

00:29:56.510 --> 00:30:00.720 align:middle line:84%
There's still not
reliable machines

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:07.420 align:middle line:84%
that can test and duplicate
the tests for life force

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that can be
scientifically proven.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So all you can go
on is empirical evidence.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:14.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, thank God they've
even done those tests.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.070 align:middle line:84%
Thank God you can even measure
energy anymore and have it

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.860 align:middle line:84%
reflected back visually
so you can see.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.820 align:middle line:84%
That's really cool, what
you're talking about,

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.294 align:middle line:84%
where your own life
force goes down

00:30:23.294 --> 00:30:24.960 align:middle line:84%
when you're handed
one of these objects.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.150 align:middle line:10%
So we have to go on
empirical evidence

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.880 align:middle line:10%
right now until, as you say,
almost the world of quantum

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.890 align:middle line:10%
chemistry can start bearing
it out on another level.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.105 align:middle line:10%
But the news is
just don't do it.

00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:10%

>>GROUP: It's even
simpler than that.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:43.700 align:middle line:10%
It goes back down to you
making an informed decision

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.400 align:middle line:10%
on what you're going
to put in your body.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.100 align:middle line:10%

forget about all the

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.800 align:middle line:90%
with fish.

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I was reading an article

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:17.300 align:middle line:84%
about the new Frankenfish,
which is apparently

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.620 align:middle line:84%
Congress is perilously close to
passing legislation that would

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.760 align:middle line:84%
allow for genetically modified
salmon to be farm fished.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about farm fishing
to begin with and then

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%
genetically modified
fish on top of that.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.800 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, the good news is
that countries are waking up.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.450 align:middle line:84%
And they're now requiring
labeling for GMOs,

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and that's really-- this
latest labeling for GMOs push

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:45.800 align:middle line:84%
in California, even
though it failed,

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:51.260 align:middle line:84%
really educated the masses on
GMOs and how toxic they are.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.077 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just
sick, especially, yes.

00:31:54.077 --> 00:31:55.910 align:middle line:84%
You've taking it from
plants, and now you're

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.140 align:middle line:90%
using it on animals.

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.687 align:middle line:84%
What that does, when you're
talking about animals

00:31:59.687 --> 00:32:02.020 align:middle line:84%
especially and you have eggs
floating around the streams

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.482 align:middle line:84%
and everything, is it completely
contaminates the DNA of--

00:32:06.482 --> 00:32:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: The healthy--

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.010 align:middle line:84%

healthy fish as well.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:11.900 align:middle line:84%

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: It is farmed.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.830 align:middle line:84%
But whenever you
have farmed, you

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:20.630 align:middle line:84%
can have the spread of even
farmed fish into other areas.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.830 align:middle line:84%
For example, I mean, even though
you're trying to contain it,

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.220 align:middle line:90%
it's still hard to contain.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You might have birds or
something that come down,

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:29.710 align:middle line:84%
or you might have some
other organism that

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
just gets out and spontaneously
brings stuff into other areas.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:40.000 align:middle line:84%
Throughout history we've
seen that you can't really

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.480 align:middle line:90%
contain things like that.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.975 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can try.

00:32:42.975 --> 00:32:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But eventually that's
going to get out.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Nature has a way
of spreading it around.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.413 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yeah.

00:32:46.413 --> 00:32:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Nature has a way of spreading
it around, those codes.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So I totally disagree with
any genetic modification

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.710 align:middle line:84%
on animals, because
animals are supposed

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.530 align:middle line:84%
to be the way they
are naturally.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And what you have still is
even when you're genetically

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:84%
engineering the fish,
you're feeding those animals

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.862 align:middle line:90%
genetically engineered food.

00:33:08.862 --> 00:33:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's another
problem with meat,

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.090 align:middle line:84%
is you're feeding these cattle
genetically modified corn.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:13.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.751 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: And you're
feeding-- and all

00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:84%
that gets into the genetic

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.500 align:middle line:90%
eating it.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.620 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what about
farm fishing itself,

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.310 align:middle line:84%
even if we were removing
the genetic modification

>>GROUP: Well, you
have to ask yourself

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.790 align:middle line:84%
is that a natural thing that

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.770 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And any time it's
not natural, you

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:84%
have synthetic feed
that's involved.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:90%

of where the fish are living.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.226 align:middle line:90%
You have high fecal matter.

00:33:46.226 --> 00:33:47.183 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Excess waste.

00:33:47.183 --> 00:33:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Excess waste.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
the natural oxygen

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.830 align:middle line:84%
flow of the streams
and the water.

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.760 align:middle line:84%
There was a study
done not too long ago.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:84%
They tested every water
source in the world,

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
and every single water
source in the world

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:90%
is contaminated with mercury.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.090 align:middle line:84%
So you have high levels of
mercury in fish, I mean, now.

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So any time you eat
fish, regardless

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.380 align:middle line:84%
whether it's genetically
modified or not,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.250 align:middle line:84%
you're still going to be
getting toxins and chemicals

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:90%
through that.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.560 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about, say,
high northern coldwater

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.464 align:middle line:84%

00:34:24.464 --> 00:34:26.130 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Those are

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.909 align:middle line:84%
Those are going to be

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:31.159 align:middle line:84%
But they're still contaminated,
but they're the least.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And the smaller the
fish, the better.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.460 align:middle line:84%
The larger the fish, the
higher concentrations

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.530 align:middle line:90%

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And what about

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.719 align:middle line:84%
when we're talking about
the flow of radiation,

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:52.790 align:middle line:84%
has there been some

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:57.530 align:middle line:84%
from the Fukushima accident
into the fish supplies,

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:00.970 align:middle line:84%
even those that are,
as you say-- I buy tuna

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.370 align:middle line:84%
from a man who
harvests his own very

young tuna in a specific area
and tests and everything,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.400 align:middle line:84%
but has that even been
contaminated with radiation?

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.670 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: It's been talked about
a lot, the whole Fukushima

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.230 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I would say yes
just because I know

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.860 align:middle line:84%
that up in the
Oregon, the Pacific

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Northwest, and
northern California,

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.660 align:middle line:84%
which is not being
reported in the mainstream,

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:84%
but we're having spontaneous
abortions with women

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.280 align:middle line:84%
and we're having a lot of
complications with pregnancies

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and even altered fetuses
when they come out.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:40.785 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:35:40.785 --> 00:35:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Higher incidence

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Higher incidence

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:50.100 align:middle line:84%

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.309 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're still finding

00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:35:52.975 --> 00:35:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: But the fact
is what I recommend

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:59.880 align:middle line:84%
everybody do right now is to
take a good detoxified iodine.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.370 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've been
recommending the people over

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:06.460 align:middle line:84%
in Japan as well as in
the Pacific Northwest,

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.570 align:middle line:84%
to-- we don't know how
contaminated the farmland is

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.890 align:middle line:84%
out there, because
Oregon, you have beautiful

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.020 align:middle line:84%
farmland up in Oregon
and northern California

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:90%
and the wines up there.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But we don't really know how
contaminated that is yet,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.100 align:middle line:84%
although we do know that
independent people who

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.980 align:middle line:84%
have been testing
radiation levels

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.639 align:middle line:90%
have shown increased radiation.

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So you're looking at
detoxified iodine, you said.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:34.800 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.230 align:middle line:90%
In what form does it come?

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I've seen every
different kind of iodine,

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.310 align:middle line:84%
so what form are
you talking about?

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.655 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: The only form I
recommend is a nascent iodine.

00:36:44.655 --> 00:36:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It was based off of
Edgar Cayce's research.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:50.530 align:middle line:84%
You have potassium
iodide, and you just

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.420 align:middle line:84%
have the iodine that's
in the drug store.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.940 align:middle line:84%
That usually can
be contaminated.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.180 align:middle line:84%
What you want to do is in
order to make a nascent iodine,

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.000 align:middle line:84%
it's in the usable
form that you would

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.554 align:middle line:90%
get after it's broken down.

00:37:01.554 --> 00:37:02.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, let's say
you ate kelp which

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:04.194 align:middle line:90%
has a natural iodine in it.

00:37:04.194 --> 00:37:04.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.234 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Your body
would break it

00:37:06.234 --> 00:37:09.170 align:middle line:84%
down to kind of a
nascent iodine, which

00:37:09.170 --> 00:37:12.390 align:middle line:84%
means a usable energetic
form of iodine that's

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.850 align:middle line:84%
going to be safe and
utilized in your body.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.870 align:middle line:84%
Basically, everybody
is iodine deficient.

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, nobody's
eating enough kelp or--

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.370 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We don't
have in our food.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.050 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --or any other sources
of iodine that are out there.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.850 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, I think it's a
good idea that for everybody

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:30.480 align:middle line:90%
to be on an iodine supplement.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:84%
But the one I
recommend, the one that

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.650 align:middle line:84%
works the best for your
thyroid, the one that

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.920 align:middle line:84%
works the best for
radiation and-- iodine's

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.780 align:middle line:84%
great for other mental
detoxification as well.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:46.266 align:middle line:84%
So that is a clean,
safe form that I use

00:37:46.266 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:90%
and that I would recommend.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:48.480 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What form
does that come in?

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Is it a liquid or--

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:50.060 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: It's a liquid.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a liquid.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Nascent iodine.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we
need to look for.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.130 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:55.920 align:middle line:84%
What about the other
types of greens?

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
big deal, right?

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:00.809 align:middle line:84%

chlorella or algae or--

00:38:00.809 --> 00:38:01.600 align:middle line:90%

>>GROUP: --all those
different types of greens,

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:10.800 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, right now, you're

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.520 align:middle line:84%
just because the
water is contaminated.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing high
levels of lead in those.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:23.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm always a green fan,
green juice, just juice.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times if
you juice, the toxins

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.920 align:middle line:84%
will be held in the
fibrous compound of it.

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.390 align:middle line:84%
But go with going
with organic greens.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And whoever the
company is that you're

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:39.860 align:middle line:84%
using, if you request a C of
A or some sort of analysis

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:45.170 align:middle line:84%
from that company, that's
the best way to go about it.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:84%
I personally don't-- what I do
is I get a local organic share,

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and we juice kale and all
different types of greens.

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:57.360 align:middle line:84%
So I just have my
green juices that way.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not recommending a certain
brand of organic green powder,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.380 align:middle line:84%
which would be a
combination like Spirulina,

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:05.700 align:middle line:84%
blue-green algae, or
something like that.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people that

to see if that's happened.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.630 align:middle line:84%
But again, nature has a great
way of detoxifying itself.

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.200 align:middle line:84%
The oceans have
detoxified themselves,

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.860 align:middle line:84%
what we thought
would never happen.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:32.401 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sure, there's
a lot of people

00:39:32.401 --> 00:39:34.790 align:middle line:84%
that are using energetic
devices right now that people

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.490 align:middle line:90%
don't know about to detoxify.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
using their mind

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.670 align:middle line:84%
and their spiritual
ability to help detoxify

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:43.580 align:middle line:84%
the air and the
chemtrails and the Earth.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.410 align:middle line:84%
And I think a lot of
that positive energy

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:52.710 align:middle line:84%
is-- knowing what you
could do with your thoughts

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.894 align:middle line:84%
and with mass consciousness
and with everybody doing it,

00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:57.560 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing that
can't be detoxified

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.780 align:middle line:84%
or nothing that
can't be changed.

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.580 align:middle line:84%
So when you factor
in all those factors,

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.300 align:middle line:84%
the main thing that
people can do right now

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is to worry about getting
the cleanest sources of stuff

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.830 align:middle line:84%
to put in their body, but then
also detoxifying their body

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:13.660 align:middle line:90%
on a regular basis.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:90%

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.890 align:middle line:90%
The home, OK.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So in your home we
have a lot of things

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.650 align:middle line:90%
we interface with every day.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Women interface with a lot
more things than men interface

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.960 align:middle line:90%
with, generally speaking.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.310 align:middle line:84%
But let's just talk about
the gender-neutral stuff,

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.390 align:middle line:84%
like washing our
dishes and vacuuming

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:37.200 align:middle line:84%
the house and the stuff we
put on the floor to clean it.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.080 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the things
that are just absolute stay away

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.850 align:middle line:84%
from it, don't put
it into your home?

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:44.612 align:middle line:90%
And conversely, what's good?

00:40:44.612 --> 00:40:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: People ask me what's
the one thing I can do,

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.710 align:middle line:84%
and what's the worst
thing for me in my home.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And I always say the first
thing that you want to do

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:53.950 align:middle line:84%
is you want to look
at your air quality,

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.450 align:middle line:84%
because what we have is
sick building and sick home

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:00.350 align:middle line:84%
syndrome, because we
have circulating air.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
We have volatile
organic compounds

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.390 align:middle line:84%
that are being outgassed
from the paint on the walls.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:90%
The carpets are extremely toxic.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was a study
done with a baby crawling

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.520 align:middle line:84%
on the floor for four
hours or something

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:15.967 align:middle line:84%
like that puts the equivalent
of two packs of cigarettes

00:41:15.967 --> 00:41:16.925 align:middle line:90%
into the baby's lungs--

00:41:16.925 --> 00:41:17.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh my God.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --because of
all the outgassings.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, carpet is made
with-- sprayed down

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.360 align:middle line:90%
with fire retardants.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:29.080 align:middle line:84%
If you get a list of all the
chemicals that are in carpet,

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the outgassings
from those chemicals

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
and the leeching of those
chemicals into the air

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:40.320 align:middle line:84%
could just create a toxic
room or multiple toxic rooms

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.570 align:middle line:90%
in your house or your offices.

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.790 align:middle line:84%
So I always say air,
number one, because you're

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:48.870 align:middle line:90%
taking 30,000 breaths a day.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's so many different
things that can contribute

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.480 align:middle line:84%
to toxic air-- the
cleaning supplies,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.890 align:middle line:84%
the candles that are
burning in the home, the--

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.227 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Dirty filters?

00:41:59.227 --> 00:42:01.560 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: The dirty filters,
the air-conditioning system,

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that's lurking
around in the house.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Those are all things that
contribute to toxic air

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:12.450 align:middle line:84%
that all need to be
addressed individually

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:15.410 align:middle line:84%
when you're talking about
the first step to creating

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:18.469 align:middle line:84%
a-- taking a toxic home

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:20.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What are some of
the technologies you can use

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.968 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of air filters,
for example, if we just

00:42:22.968 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
start with the circulating air,
the air-conditioning system?

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Are there ways that we can
reasonably and nontoxically

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.539 align:middle line:84%
remove a lot of these
things from the air?

00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:33.080 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yes.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.440 align:middle line:84%
There's a system
that I recommend.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.380 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
REME System that can

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.946 align:middle line:84%
be put-- they make
plug-in units.

00:42:41.946 --> 00:42:43.820 align:middle line:84%
There's a company called
RGF that makes them.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And every couple of
years I'll evaluate

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.800 align:middle line:84%
what's out there, what's
the easiest for people

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:51.710 align:middle line:84%
to implement, and what's
the most cost effective way

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.830 align:middle line:90%
to implement pure air.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And they have a system called
the REME unit which actually

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.870 align:middle line:84%
plugs into your HVAC system,
where your air comes out

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.670 align:middle line:84%
of your system before it goes
to all the different areas

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.150 align:middle line:90%
and rooms in your house.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.470 align:middle line:90%
And it's very simple to do.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:09.750 align:middle line:84%
You just cut a hole, and
then you install this unit.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And what it does is it creates
ionized hydroperoxides.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And these ionized
hydroperoxides kind of work

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.220 align:middle line:84%
like the hydrogen
we talked about

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and the oxygen singlets earlier
that neutralize and bind

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:28.110 align:middle line:84%
to viruses, bacteria,
dust in the air,

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:31.105 align:middle line:84%
all the dander, all the toxins
that are floating in the air--

00:43:31.105 --> 00:43:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Wonderful.

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.760 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --and cause them
to drop down to the floor.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.830 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
vacuum, hopefully you'll

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.000 align:middle line:84%
have a HEPA filter on your
vacuum, which we recommend.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll be able
to vacuum all of them up.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.270 align:middle line:84%
But that's the
simplest way, and you

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.820 align:middle line:84%
can get a unit-- each
unit per HVAC for probably

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.310 align:middle line:84%
around $1,500, and
that will completely

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:51.975 align:middle line:90%
clean the air in your home.

00:43:51.975 --> 00:43:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's wonderful.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.725 align:middle line:84%

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.090 align:middle line:84%
the most toxic and the
pillows are so toxic.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.660 align:middle line:84%
People complain of headaches
and insomnia and all these sleep

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.760 align:middle line:90%
problems.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.420 align:middle line:84%

A pillow six years old can
contain hundreds of thousands

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.326 align:middle line:90%
of dust mites in it.

00:44:29.326 --> 00:44:30.700 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't
see dust mites.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.990 align:middle line:84%
And dust mites
feed off of dander.

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:36.220 align:middle line:84%
Your dander is just your
skin cells or your pet's.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other story

>>GROUP: --those are
the worst mattresses.

00:44:48.709 --> 00:44:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Number one, they create a

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And number two, those
foam that they use

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.950 align:middle line:84%
are completely soaked
in fire retardants again

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.590 align:middle line:84%
and all types of
noxious chemicals.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.740 align:middle line:84%

No wonder they have headaches.

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.160 align:middle line:84%
You would be amazed
at what you can

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:84%
do by cleaning up the bedroom,
putting a couple live plants

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:22.850 align:middle line:84%

getting rid of that mattress.

night to the computer

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:84%
you have on the side

energy from your system

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.810 align:middle line:84%

can cause an energy drain.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:33.476 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:36.900 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Really, when you
look at the big picture,

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:84%
the simplest way to do it is
every single thing you do,

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.500 align:middle line:84%
the next time you do
it, do it with organic.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.580 align:middle line:84%
The next time you need to paint
the walls in your bedroom,

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.530 align:middle line:90%
use organic clay paint.

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Organic clay paint is
going to absorb toxins.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:56.210 align:middle line:84%
It's going to put out negative
ions into the air for you.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:58.610 align:middle line:84%
Put fresh plants
around your house that

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:02.345 align:middle line:84%
produce extra oxygen, and
plants actually suck in toxins.

00:48:02.345 --> 00:48:06.530 align:middle line:90%


00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Transfer all of those supplies
in your shower, in your bath,

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:16.520 align:middle line:84%
from toxic soaps to an
organic natural soap,

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.980 align:middle line:84%
toxic hair-cleaning supplies,
shampoos, and conditioners

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.980 align:middle line:84%

shampoos and conditioners.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.630 align:middle line:84%
Get a water purification
system for your house

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:28.060 align:middle line:90%
if you don't have one.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:31.579 align:middle line:84%
The best thing you can do
is to use a shower filter.

00:48:31.579 --> 00:48:33.120 align:middle line:84%
Get a good shower
filter since you're

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.930 align:middle line:84%
going to be bathing in
it or taking a shower it.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.930 align:middle line:84%
One hot shower could
be the equivalent

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.950 align:middle line:84%
of you drinking seven
glasses of tap water

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.550 align:middle line:84%
as far as the toxins
and the chemicals

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:43.170 align:middle line:90%
coming into your system.

00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.753 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Because
your pores are open,

00:48:44.753 --> 00:48:46.359 align:middle line:84%
and it's coming into
the entire body.

00:48:46.359 --> 00:48:48.525 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Next time you need
to-- you go to the store

00:48:48.525 --> 00:48:53.200 align:middle line:84%
and look for makeup, look
for a natural form of makeup.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.610 align:middle line:84%
Start evaluating all
the little things

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.350 align:middle line:84%
from the time you
wake up in the morning

00:48:57.350 --> 00:49:00.020 align:middle line:84%
and then you take a shower, all
those things in your bedroom.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.694 align:middle line:90%
And then you go to the kitchen.

00:49:01.694 --> 00:49:03.860 align:middle line:84%
What are you going to do
first thing in the kitchen?

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.050 align:middle line:84%
You're going to probably
turn the coffee pot on.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Replace your store-bought
coffee with organic coffee.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Don't use any refined
sugar, or don't

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.080 align:middle line:90%
use any artificial sweeteners.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.600 align:middle line:84%
Saccharin, Aspartame,
Splenda, all that stuff

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.705 align:middle line:90%
is toxic to your body.

00:49:23.705 --> 00:49:25.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Neurotoxins,
horrible stuff.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.250 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Horrible.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:26.630 align:middle line:90%
Neurotoxins.

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What would you
suggest if a person wants

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:30.243 align:middle line:84%
to put a sweetener in
and they're not really

00:49:30.243 --> 00:49:31.530 align:middle line:90%
down with Stevia?

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Of the ones that are
standard and natural,

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:36.144 align:middle line:90%
would you say a local raw honey?

00:49:36.144 --> 00:49:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Or what would you say?

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.180 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Local organic-- well,
only one company certifies

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:43.020 align:middle line:84%
honey organic, because
technically the bees

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.330 align:middle line:90%
can travel miles.

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:49.730 align:middle line:84%
But a local raw honey
would be a good replacement

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.400 align:middle line:84%
just because honey contains
glucose oxidase in it, which

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:56.370 align:middle line:84%
is an enzyme that turns
glucose into hydrogen peroxide.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:57.990 align:middle line:90%
That's why honey never goes bad.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:01.840 align:middle line:84%
They found honey in tombs
that had been 4,000 years old,

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:90%
and the honey's still good.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Raw agave nectar is
another replacement.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:12.094 align:middle line:84%
Also, they have raw
coconut sugar now.

00:50:12.094 --> 00:50:12.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:13.900 align:middle line:90%
That's god.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: But really,
you should try

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.550 align:middle line:84%
to get away from using
any type of sugars.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But it's still going to do
you so much good replacing

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.340 align:middle line:84%
a refined sugar with one
of those substitutes.

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:27.490 align:middle line:84%
A raw sugar would
be your best best.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.454 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you hit
on it a little bit ago.

00:50:29.454 --> 00:50:31.370 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want to go
back to really quickly,

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:34.820 align:middle line:84%
because I'm trying to get in
my own mind, the organic latex

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:38.060 align:middle line:84%
mattress, is that just
something about like yea

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.970 align:middle line:84%
that you put on a solid
platform if you're

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.259 align:middle line:90%
doing away with coils?

00:50:41.259 --> 00:50:41.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Yes.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.390 align:middle line:90%
You put it on a solid platform.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.130 align:middle line:84%
They have different levels,
different thickness.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.200 align:middle line:90%
Different companies make them.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.856 align:middle line:84%
The best place, probably
just look on Amazon.com.

00:50:50.856 --> 00:50:54.970 align:middle line:84%
They have all the organic
latex mattresses there

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:59.145 align:middle line:84%
and the different, even,
pads that come with them,

00:50:59.145 --> 00:51:01.799 align:middle line:84%
if you want firm, medium,
soft, stuff like that.

00:51:01.799 --> 00:51:02.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So I just wanted
to get that clear.

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Better than going
back to horse hair.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.688 align:middle line:84%
Besides, you'd have
too many mites in it.

00:51:06.688 --> 00:51:09.490 align:middle line:84%
I did sleep on a horse hair
mattress about a year ago.

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:10.900 align:middle line:84%
It was an interesting
experience.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It was about 150 years old.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Might as well have
just slept on the wood.

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.840 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Probably.

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:16.760 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It was
pretty matted down.

OK.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:19.325 align:middle line:84%
Dirty electricity you
touched on just a bit,

00:51:19.325 --> 00:51:21.720 align:middle line:84%
but can you go into that
just a little bit more

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.340 align:middle line:84%
about the outlets
around your bed, what

00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:27.182 align:middle line:84%
you have plugged into
them, and so forth?

00:51:27.182 --> 00:51:28.640 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: What we're
trying to do is

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.480 align:middle line:84%
just-- electricity has
an effect on the body.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.890 align:middle line:84%
It has an altering
effect, and radiation

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.800 align:middle line:84%
has an altering
effect on the body.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Hair dryers, any type of
clocks that are plugged in,

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:43.440 align:middle line:84%
big-screen TVs, all the
electronics in your home--

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and now with these new
smart meters, that's

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:51.400 align:middle line:84%
a whole other subject that's a
very debatable situation right

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.050 align:middle line:84%
now with them being

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.980 align:middle line:84%

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:00.960 align:middle line:84%
But Masaru Emoto
proved when he put

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.020 align:middle line:84%
a piece of-- a glass of
water in front of a TV,

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.660 align:middle line:84%
he said that the
electromagnetic radiation has

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:10.344 align:middle line:84%
such a strong effect on water,
it's more damaging, pretty

00:52:10.344 --> 00:52:12.760 align:middle line:84%
much, than anything else that
you could do to your system.

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if you're sleeping in
front of a television, people

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.830 align:middle line:90%
who have it on all night.

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:19.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: So your body is 80%
water, and think about that.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.190 align:middle line:90%
You have a cell phone.

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You live near-- and
this has been proven.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:28.650 align:middle line:84%
People that live near electrical
wires or even cell phone towers

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:30.990 align:middle line:90%
are coming down with illnesses.

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:33.390 align:middle line:90%
They're chronically ill.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Their body just can't get the
energy it needs to heal itself.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:41.400 align:middle line:84%
So what I recommend doing
is putting shungite stones

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:84%
or crystals, which actually
absorb a lot of energy.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.300 align:middle line:84%
I use a company

In order for them
to see such detail,

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:57.190 align:middle line:84%
they got to hit you
with a massive amount

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:00.940 align:middle line:84%
of a beam of radiation
that's concentrated

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
over your whole body that only
takes a couple seconds to do.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:09.040 align:middle line:84%
So right now, there's
people out there,

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.800 align:middle line:84%
they will not release
publicly the information

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.800 align:middle line:84%
on exactly how much
ionizing radiation

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.950 align:middle line:84%
they're using per jolt
and all that stuff--

00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:18.160 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No, they won't.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.440 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: --because they
don't want you to know.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:21.939 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: In fact, they tell
you as you go through, oh, this

00:54:21.939 --> 00:54:23.160 align:middle line:90%
isn't that old technology.

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:23.910 align:middle line:90%
This is a new one.

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:24.840 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly safe.

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:25.960 align:middle line:84%
They tell that to
anyone who objects.

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.376 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: There's
a sign there that

00:54:27.376 --> 00:54:29.620 align:middle line:84%
says, ah, you don't have
to worry about this.

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:30.679 align:middle line:90%
It's perfectly safe.

00:54:30.679 --> 00:54:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You're saying huh-uh.

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Well, there's no way.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I've talked to people
that have worked

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:41.360 align:middle line:84%
for the company and people that
are well versed in radiation.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.105 align:middle line:84%
And they say that
each time you go

00:54:44.105 --> 00:54:45.480 align:middle line:84%
through one of
those scanners, it

00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:49.680 align:middle line:84%
can be the equivalent of
you having seven CAT scans.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Seriously?

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: Up to seven CAT scans.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.180 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Every time you go
through the vrrp-vrrp imaging

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:54.679 align:middle line:90%
machine?

00:54:54.679 --> 00:54:57.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Every time
you go through it, yes.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.960 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Who's told you that?

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.475 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Just sources that
are in the radiation field.

00:55:02.475 --> 00:55:03.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Good.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell the TSA people that
tomorrow when I go through--

00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Well, I've
told them that.

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They don't care.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.800 align:middle line:90%
>>GROUP: They don't even know.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.370 align:middle line:84%
But another thing an
insider has told me

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:17.040 align:middle line:84%
that many TSA agents are
coming down and becoming ill

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and showing up with cancer
just from standing next

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.960 align:middle line:90%
to the body scanners.

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:21.230 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.730 align:middle line:90%
And they do.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.989 align:middle line:84%
They say they have high
degree-- because I've asked,

00:55:23.989 --> 00:55:25.780 align:middle line:84%
how come you have so
few people here today?

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.150 align:middle line:84%
And they'll say,
oh, they're out ill.

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.270 align:middle line:84%
And, I mean, they'll have
up to a quarter or third

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:31.520 align:middle line:84%
of their staff ill
almost all the time now.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.150 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: That happened to
me on the way up here, too.

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:34.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --because they've
been around those machines.

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:34.950 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:35.920 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:40.030 align:middle line:90%
We only have a few minutes left.

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:43.680 align:middle line:84%
You've given just
invaluable information.

00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.340 align:middle line:84%
What can we do from a
larger systemic level

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.280 align:middle line:90%
about all of this?

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I know
you're an advocate.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And you and Mike Adams,
the Health Ranger,

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:57.580 align:middle line:84%
you're both out there
among others doing your job

00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:58.770 align:middle line:90%
to educate the rest of us.

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:02.660 align:middle line:84%
What can we do to help
forward some of these measures

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.540 align:middle line:90%
ourselves?

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:09.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: The best thing is to
just slowly start eliminating

00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:12.360 align:middle line:84%
toxic compounds from your life,
because the more people do

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:15.440 align:middle line:84%
that, the more it's going
to put the big companies out

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.540 align:middle line:90%
of business.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So exactly what I
was talking about,

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:23.390 align:middle line:84%
the next time that you
need-- just buying organic.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:26.080 align:middle line:84%
The next time that you need
to have your yard sprayed,

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.877 align:middle line:84%
for instance, don't
call the guy that's

00:56:27.877 --> 00:56:29.460 align:middle line:84%
going to come spray
your yard with all

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.310 align:middle line:90%
the toxic chemical pesticides.

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Call the guy that's going to use
all the natural organic stuff.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:37.570 align:middle line:84%
Next time you need
to buy skin lotion,

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:39.300 align:middle line:84%
don't buy a chemical-based
skin lotion.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.600 align:middle line:84%
Buy one that's certified
organic or natural.

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.770 align:middle line:84%
The more that each
individual person

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:50.200 align:middle line:84%
changes their own environment,
the more the whole environment

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.720 align:middle line:90%
is going to change.

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.060 align:middle line:84%
So really the whole
message that we're all

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to get out there is
change your environment.

00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Change the environment
you live in around.

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Change your home.

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:06.360 align:middle line:84%
Help change your
friends' environment,

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.596 align:middle line:84%
and then the environment
changes as a whole.

00:57:08.596 --> 00:57:09.470 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And we're driving it
with our pocketbook.

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And before we go, we just
have a minute or so left.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.860 align:middle line:84%
Just some teases as to
some really exciting stuff

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.900 align:middle line:90%
you're working on right now.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.470 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: What we're
working on now

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is being able to have
therapeutic doses--

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.430 align:middle line:84%
all organic and natural
medicine basically--

00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that's going to not only work as
a natural medicine would work,

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:33.750 align:middle line:84%
let's say, kind of like a
pharmaceutical would work,

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:36.110 align:middle line:84%
blocking something or
shutting something down,

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.870 align:middle line:84%
but more or less
advancing Neutraceuticals

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:42.110 align:middle line:84%
to the next level using
quantum technology

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.820 align:middle line:84%
based off of, by
the way, technology

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.390 align:middle line:84%
that was being done in
the 1600s and the 1500s,

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:50.110 align:middle line:84%
because everything
repeats itself.

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:51.700 align:middle line:84%
We try to do
everything ourselves.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:53.116 align:middle line:84%
And then we go,
oh, wait a minute.

00:57:53.116 --> 00:57:55.020 align:middle line:84%
They were doing it
right 200 years ago.

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:57.030 align:middle line:84%
We just need to copy
what they were doing.

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:59.363 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're doing
with organic and sustainable

00:57:59.363 --> 00:58:00.040 align:middle line:90%
farming, too.

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.612 align:middle line:84%
But the things and
the technologies

00:58:01.612 --> 00:58:03.070 align:middle line:84%
that are coming
out, hopefully, are

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:04.810 align:middle line:84%
going to eliminate
the oil and gas, which

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:07.412 align:middle line:90%
would be free energy technology.

00:58:07.412 --> 00:58:09.036 align:middle line:84%
And that's being
pushed for, especially

00:58:09.036 --> 00:58:11.010 align:middle line:90%
by the Keshe Foundation.

00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And being able to replace all
pharmaceuticals with highly

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.870 align:middle line:84%
therapeutic-- 400 times
the therapeutic value

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:24.180 align:middle line:84%
of what you would get right
now with therapeutic herbs

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.340 align:middle line:84%
based off of Paracelsus'
work, and that

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.580 align:middle line:90%
would be spagyric formulas.

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:31.720 align:middle line:84%
That and just
educating people on how

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:35.440 align:middle line:84%
they can take responsibility
for their own health

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and start-- because
even if someone makes

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:41.430 align:middle line:84%
tiny changes here, that
might mean one less

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:42.695 align:middle line:90%
visit to the doctor's office.

00:58:42.695 --> 00:58:43.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's right.

00:58:43.290 --> 00:58:44.831 align:middle line:84%
>>GROUP: Now, one
last visit-- if you

00:58:44.831 --> 00:58:48.190 align:middle line:84%
count all the doctors' office
visits, millions and millions

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:52.570 align:middle line:84%
and millions every single
month, if you just take one less

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:55.370 align:middle line:84%
office visit for everybody,
you're talking about millions.

00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:57.230 align:middle line:90%
How much do you save in gas?

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:58.870 align:middle line:84%
How much do you--
the fossil fuels

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:01.250 align:middle line:84%
that you didn't use to
protect the environment.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:04.890 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the
big picture of taking

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:07.300 align:middle line:84%
these minor, little
baby steps, you're

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:09.800 align:middle line:84%
also reducing the cost,
like you said, too,

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.450 align:middle line:84%
because the more people that
demand it, the cost goes down.

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And it puts out the
big-- it's taking

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.750 align:middle line:90%
care of that big picture.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, all I
can say, fabulous work.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:23.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, there should've been
a few dozen takeaways here.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.020 align:middle line:10%
If you want the whole story,
go to Dr. Group's website,

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:28.940 align:middle line:10%
GlobalHealingCenter.com,
for the rest of the story.

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:31.000 align:middle line:10%
The book is called "The
Green Body Cleanse,"

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.820 align:middle line:10%
and it is among the
most thorough books

00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:35.600 align:middle line:10%
on the subject of colon health
and overall health I have ever

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.480 align:middle line:10%
encountered.

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:38.480 align:middle line:84%
If by chance you didn't
see our first interview,

00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I highly recommend you go find
it in the Gaiam TV archives.

00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:46.470 align:middle line:84%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.
