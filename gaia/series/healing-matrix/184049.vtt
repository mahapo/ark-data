>>DR. SUE MORTER: Paul Austin
is an entrepreneur dedicated

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:10%
to educating individuals about
responsible and intentional use

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.308 align:middle line:10%
of psychedelics for
personal transformation.

00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder of
"The Third Wave",

>>PAUL AUSTIN:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm really excited
for this conversation.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Me, too.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:90%
So tell us your story.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.410 align:middle line:90%
How did this start?

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.320 align:middle line:84%
How does one get
engaged in psychedelics

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and then translate that into
transformational exercises?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:10%
>>AUSTIN: So I grew up in
a fairly traditional family

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.190 align:middle line:10%
in West Michigan.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:10%
And growing up, I was always
taught that illegal drugs

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:10%
were bad and harmful.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.300 align:middle line:90%
I smoked cannabis when I was 16.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And then when I was
19, I had a chance

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to do LSD for the first
time, and I had the most

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:90%
profound experience of my life.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:10%
And when I had that experience--

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:10%
for much of my upbringing, I
had internalized a lot of shame

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.263 align:middle line:10%
about who I was, about the
things that I liked to do.

00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And when I had
that experience, it

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
helped to reframe things, where
I saw that, oh, I have nothing

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:84%
to be ashamed of, but that
our culture at large is

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.530 align:middle line:84%
where the shame lies,
is where the issues lie.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.000 align:middle line:84%
So when I had that experience,
I kind of came to the conclusion

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.430 align:middle line:84%
that it was in my
power and my agency

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.820 align:middle line:84%
to do something to be able to
transform culture at large.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And so I pursued a fairly
unconventional path.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.647 align:middle line:84%
When I graduated
from undergrad, I

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:55.480 align:middle line:84%
moved abroad and lived
in Turkey for a year,

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.910 align:middle line:90%
where I taught English.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
I then bootstrapped
an initial business,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
built a business, an
online English school,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and then used some
profits from that

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.520 align:middle line:84%
to launch The
Third Wave in 2015,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.039 align:middle line:84%
which is this resource
about microdosing,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
but also general psychedelic
use for transformation.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how did the
actual psychedelic use

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.420 align:middle line:90%
change your life?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
What happened within you because
of this use that lit you up,

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.110 align:middle line:84%
that turned your life in
a different direction?

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: I think
the core of it is

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
getting over the fear
of death and recognizing

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.490 align:middle line:84%
that fear of death is what holds
us back from really pursuing

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.785 align:middle line:84%
the dreams that we want
to pursue and the things

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:90%
that we want to do in life.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Because once you realize that
death is just another cycle,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.700 align:middle line:84%
is just another thing
that we go through,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.860 align:middle line:84%
and we realize this
through psychedelics

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.730 align:middle line:84%
because we have these deep,
profound mystical experiences

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
where we feel connected
to everything,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and we recognize
that we're really

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
just energy in a larger
universe, that that is energy,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.500 align:middle line:90%
and that we're cycling through.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.155 align:middle line:84%
And so that when that
fear was eliminated,

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:06.030 align:middle line:84%
it gave me the courage
and the ability to go,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.250 align:middle line:84%
well, I'm going to
go out I'm going

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
to pursue this really
kind of out-there path

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.200 align:middle line:84%
that most people
haven't gone through

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:84%
to try to develop a life and
develop a story that people can

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
be motivated and inspired by
to go and help change culture

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.450 align:middle line:84%
Because the core
recognition that I came to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.810 align:middle line:84%
in those experiences was that
the culture that we live in

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.050 align:middle line:84%
is totally out of harmony
with who we are as humans

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.020 align:middle line:84%
and where we come from, and that
the only way that we are going

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
to, for example, get through
this ecological crisis,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.660 align:middle line:84%
the only way that we're going
to be able to heal as a culture

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and society is to come
back to that recognition

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.820 align:middle line:84%
that we are in fact
connected to everything.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And so in coming to
that recognition myself

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
and then starting a platform
to help other people come

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
to that recognition, I find that
psychedelics, although risky

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
when used irresponsibly or
without intention, if they're

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
used within a container, if
they're used with ritual,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
they can really help
individuals to come

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%
to that recognition in
less than 12 hours, which

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
is unheard of for
things like meditation,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.340 align:middle line:90%
or breath work, yoga.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.635 align:middle line:84%
Usually that process takes days,
if not months, if not years.

00:04:18.635 --> 00:04:20.760 align:middle line:84%
With psychedelics, you can
come to that recognition

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.650 align:middle line:90%
within a day.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why these tools are
so powerful and transformative.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I'm so interested in
getting into our conversation.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I have had an experience
with meditation,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.907 align:middle line:84%
upon another, upon another
that started immediately

00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:36.990 align:middle line:90%
when I started meditating.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.220 align:middle line:84%
I had transcendental
multidimensional experiences.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that I can relate
to what you're speaking about,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'm very curious
about this process.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
And I know lots of people
are very curious about using

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics at this point,
in one nature or another,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.863 align:middle line:84%
to try to access this
greater sense of being.

00:04:51.863 --> 00:04:53.280 align:middle line:84%
So basically what
you're saying is

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
that once we access a
greater state of reality,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:84%
we no longer have to operate
in such a state of fear,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and so many of our decisions
culturally will shift,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and we'll arrive at a greater
state of harmony and peace,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.310 align:middle line:90%
is basically what you're saying.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: We feel this deep
knowing of safety and security

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:84%
in this greater cosmic kind
of world that we're living in.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
I think there's so much
of our activity that

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.040 align:middle line:90%
is driven by fear.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So we distract
ourselves, or even we

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:84%
just we don't take
good care of ourselves.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And we come to
realize that we have

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
this direct connection
to source, which

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.270 align:middle line:90%
is pure love, pure energy.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.200 align:middle line:84%
Then when we internalize
that, we shift everything

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
that we do in our lives so
that, on a consistent basis,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.030 align:middle line:84%
even after that
psychedelic experience,

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:84%
we still feel that
sense of contentment,

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:84%
that sense of peace, that
sense of safety and security.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do people come down
out of that experience

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and have a withdrawal, have
a negative effect at all,

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.950 align:middle line:84%
wanting to have that
connection again?

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Is there is there
any kind of exchange

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.682 align:middle line:84%
there that is
challenging for them?

00:06:01.682 --> 00:06:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So that's a big part
of what we call integration.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So the integration
process is, OK, you've

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
had this peak experience,
this transcendent experience.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.950 align:middle line:84%
Now how do you come back
into this world that

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.540 align:middle line:84%
is still the world that we
live in and actually integrate?

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And that, for many
people, is very difficult.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
seeing a therapist is

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:84%
so important afterwards,
and finding community

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.032 align:middle line:84%
of other people who have
had these experiences

00:06:26.032 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:90%
and you can talk to about it.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go and
you have that experience

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and you come back into
normal everyday life,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.280 align:middle line:84%
you feel like someone has
broken a promise to you.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.130 align:middle line:84%
You feel like there
was a promise made

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
within that experience, and
you come back, and you're like,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.810 align:middle line:84%
well, this isn't
what I expected,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.550 align:middle line:90%
this isn't what I wanted.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we zoom
out from the individual

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:84%
to the collective, and why this
is so important that we not

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.230 align:middle line:84%
only help individuals
to have this experience,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.140 align:middle line:84%
but that we give them the tools
so they can help us create

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.640 align:middle line:84%
this new culture which
actually makes sense to us

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.465 align:middle line:84%
and feels like we're
in harmony with.

00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:02.723 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I want to do
more on that later.

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:84%
First, let's just
back up a second

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:84%
and say your website is
called The Third Wave.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.858 align:middle line:84%
Can you just tell us
about the third wave,

00:07:09.858 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:84%
and are there other
waves, and what's

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.108 align:middle line:90%
going on with this statement.

00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:14.150 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah yeah yeah.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.525 align:middle line:84%
So the first wave
of psychedelics

00:07:15.525 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:84%
was the use of
psychedelics for thousands

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
of years by ancient
cultures all over the globe.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So usually I point
to three examples.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
One is the use of ayahuasca
by the ancient people

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:90%
in the Amazon.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
And they drank ayahuasca
as part of their own ritual

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:90%
for spirituality.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
The second example
is the ancient Greeks

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.780 align:middle line:90%
drank a beverage called kykeon.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So this was Plato and Aristotle
used to take psychedelics

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:42.380 align:middle line:84%
as part of a larger ritual
called the Eleusinian

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Mysteries.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.828 align:middle line:84%
And then you had soma
in ancient India,

00:07:45.828 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
which is talked
about in the Bhagavad

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.248 align:middle line:90%
Gita and the Upanishads.

00:07:49.248 --> 00:07:50.790 align:middle line:84%
And soma, they think,
was a mushroom.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.903 align:middle line:84%
And again, they use this as part
of their spiritual practice.

00:07:53.903 --> 00:07:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at the
second wave of psychedelics.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:84%
This was when psychedelics
were first reintroduced

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.590 align:middle line:90%
into modern Western culture.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And it started when Albert
Hoffman invented LSD in 1938,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and then really picked up
steam in the '50s and '60s

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
with Timothy Leary,
and Richard Alpert,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.340 align:middle line:90%
and the entire counterculture.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
And the hallmark of the '60s
as we know it culturally

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:90%
was irresponsible use.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.760 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was, well,
everyone should just take LSD,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.563 align:middle line:84%
and we'll see how
that can transform.

00:08:25.563 --> 00:08:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And the big difference
between the second wave

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and the third wave
is the third wave

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
is about responsible,
intentional use

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:90%
for specific outcome.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And this has really
been kickstarted

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.495 align:middle line:84%
by the legalization of
cannabis, where we're

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
starting to re-evaluate
what we thought

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.453 align:middle line:84%
was a dangerous substance,
an illicit substance, and now

00:08:41.453 --> 00:08:43.860 align:middle line:84%
we're realizing, oh,
it has medical value

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.505 align:middle line:90%
and we can legalize it.

00:08:45.505 --> 00:08:47.880 align:middle line:84%
And then that was followed by
all of this research that's

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.172 align:middle line:84%
starting to come out about
the efficacy of psychedelics

00:08:50.172 --> 00:08:53.700 align:middle line:84%
to treat a number of
intractable clinical conditions,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.990 align:middle line:84%
like PTSD, treatment-resistant
depression, and alcoholism.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And so with those two
forces coming together,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.450 align:middle line:84%
that plus this trend
of microdosing,

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.390 align:middle line:84%
it's clear that our culture now
is more ready than it's ever

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
been to finally have a mature
conversation about how can we

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.060 align:middle line:84%
actually use these substances
appropriately for development,

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.440 align:middle line:90%
growth and transformation.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And so in the '60s
and '70s, Silicon Valley,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
Steve Jobs says LSD is one
of the most important things

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:90%
that he did in his life.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:90%
This is what you're speaking of.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:27.943 align:middle line:90%
It opens us to creativity.

00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:29.360 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
happening there?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, so
in the '60s, there's

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
this really interesting
connection between the Stanford

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Design School,
which is where a lot

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.720 align:middle line:84%
of these initial ideas for
Silicon Valley were born,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:90%
and LSD.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of the initial
research on psychedelics

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.900 align:middle line:90%
was done in Stanford.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.990 align:middle line:84%
So that combination
helped to kind of birth

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:84%
this computer age
that we now live in.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when you have this
psychedelic experience,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:84%
basically your brain has a
greater sense of connection.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
The hemispheres are
communicating with a lot more

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.860 align:middle line:90%
energy, so to say.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so because of that,
you're able to zoom out

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.140 align:middle line:84%
from the normal kind of
grit of everyday life

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and see things from
a new perspective.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people in Silicon
Valley nowadays-- executives,

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.270 align:middle line:90%
developers, engineers--

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
are able to leverage
not only microdoses

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.940 align:middle line:84%
but also higher doses to
give them new perspectives.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.080 align:middle line:84%
The technical term that we
use is pattern recognition.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
So we can see new patterns.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:84%
We have this ability to
have enhanced creativity

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
as a result of
using psychedelics.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:35.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Right brain, left brain,
interchanging, corpus callosum,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
greater communication,
connectivity,

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.158 align:middle line:84%
whole-brain thinking,
this is what--

00:10:40.158 --> 00:10:42.450 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: This is essentially
what we're talking about.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And what's great is this
isn't just about psychedelics.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:46.938 align:middle line:84%
These are similar
states of being

00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
that can be had with
meditation, that

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.813 align:middle line:84%
can be had with float tanks,
that can be had with yoga.

00:10:51.813 --> 00:10:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what's
great about psychedelics,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
is they're just one
tool in a larger toolkit

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
to facilitate altered states.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we can orient
those altered states

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.590 align:middle line:84%
towards transformation, and
wellness, and creativity.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Interesting.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.250 align:middle line:84%
The therapeutic
use of psychedelics

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
is gaining more and more
attention in the mainstream.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:90%
Take a look.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Psilocybin mushrooms are
being found to help with

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.120 align:middle line:84%
the number of epidemic-level
health issues in the modern

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The spectrum of
therapeutic effects are great.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.420 align:middle line:84%
Anxiety in terminal
patients, anxiety

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:34.740 align:middle line:84%
about-- existential anxiety
for people who are dying,

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.880 align:middle line:90%
that's one.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.940 align:middle line:90%
PTSD, it's promising for that.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.010 align:middle line:84%
It looks promising
for addictions.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.030 align:middle line:84%
There's been spectacular work
on psilocybin and smoking

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.150 align:middle line:84%
cessation, which is
kind of unexpected,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
but it's very effective
for smoking cessation.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:90%
Depression is another one.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:12:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Depression is being identified
as these FDA protocols are

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
advanced, and
psilocybin can have

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.567 align:middle line:90%
a therapeutic effect on it.

00:12:07.567 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Paul's work
with The Third Wave

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:84%
is right on board with
these new insights

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.335 align:middle line:84%
and the benefits
of psychedelics.

00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So what is the current landscape
of psychedelic science?

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the
first paper that

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:84%
was published on the
efficacy of psilocybin, which

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.000 align:middle line:84%
is the active ingredient
in magic mushrooms,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.550 align:middle line:84%
to facilitate a
mystical experience

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
was published in 2006
by Johns Hopkins.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
fundamental foundation

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
of all of the science
that we're seeing today.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:84%
So now where we're at
is there's been research

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.030 align:middle line:84%
done at places like
NYU and Johns Hopkins

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
on the efficacy of psilocybin
to treat alcoholism,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
treatment-resistant depression,
and end-of-life anxiety.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.660 align:middle line:84%
There's also been research done
by an organization called MAPS,

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:84%
the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Studies on the efficacy
of MDMA to treat PTSD.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's how we can
basically organize

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
where psychedelic
science is right now

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.160 align:middle line:90%
to treat clinical conditions.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.220 align:middle line:84%
We have psilocybin for
treatment-resistant depression,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.530 align:middle line:84%
end-of-life anxiety, and
then we have MDMA for PTSD.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And so what it's
looking like is the FDA

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.170 align:middle line:84%
has granted breakthrough
therapy status

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.390 align:middle line:90%
to both of those substances.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.140 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at psilocybin
being medically available

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.760 align:middle line:90%
by 2021.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So you can get it prescribed
to you by a physician

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.090 align:middle line:84%
to treat treatment-resistant
depression, and MDMA for PTSD,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.150 align:middle line:90%
anywhere from 2021 to 2023.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So basically the substances
becoming medically available

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.392 align:middle line:84%
is going to happen much
sooner than most people think.

00:13:39.392 --> 00:13:41.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then people
become interested,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.090 align:middle line:90%
and then they approach.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you go
about educating people

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.270 align:middle line:84%
to use these substances in
this responsible fashion,

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.615 align:middle line:90%
in this intentional manner?

00:13:50.615 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So on
the one hand, you

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.852 align:middle line:84%
have institutions like
Johns Hopkins and NYU.

00:13:55.852 --> 00:13:57.810 align:middle line:84%
And all the clinical
research that's coming out

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
is so that you need
to go to a therapist

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
or you need to go to a
physician to make this happen.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
thousands if not hundreds

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:08.040 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people
who either won't have

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.220 align:middle line:84%
the financial ability to do
that, or maybe they don't have

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.130 align:middle line:84%
something like PTSD or
treatment-resistant depression,

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.410 align:middle line:84%
but they have anxiety,
or they have depression,

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.293 align:middle line:84%
or they're just
struggling with things

00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:19.710 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
know how they can

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.130 align:middle line:84%
use this in a way that's going
to help to facilitate healing

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:90%
and transformation.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So what The Third
Wave is about is,

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
let's give every
individual-- or as

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
many individuals as
possible-- the tools

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.050 align:middle line:84%
that they need, the education
that they need so that if they

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.620 align:middle line:84%
choose to do this by themselves,
or with a guide, or a sitter,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:84%
or a group of friends,
they can make sure

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.850 align:middle line:84%
that they're following best
practices to do it correctly.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And so this is what I refer
to as psychedelic literacy,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.960 align:middle line:84%
where in our culture today
there is a complete lack

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.370 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic literacy.

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:54.087 align:middle line:84%
Most people have no idea that
psychedelics are nontoxic,

00:14:54.087 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
that they're non-addictive,
and that they're

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:90%
in fact healthy to consume.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Most people see psychedelics as
similar to other, we could say,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.530 align:middle line:84%
hard drugs because
they're illegal.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:84%
And so a big part of
that psychedelic literacy

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
is helping to reframe that.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.552 align:middle line:84%
Because as more and more
people recognize the fact

00:15:12.552 --> 00:15:14.010 align:middle line:84%
that they can use
these substances,

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.080 align:middle line:84%
that they're healing,
that they're helpful,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
then that's only going
to help our culture

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.140 align:middle line:84%
to continue to get healthier, to
improve wellness, to transform.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And from my perspective, it
all starts with the individual.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
stuff about-- we're

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.970 align:middle line:84%
dealing with all these
collective issues,

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.400 align:middle line:84%
but we can't really address
those collective issues

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.238 align:middle line:84%
unless we as individuals
start with ourselves, healing

00:15:35.238 --> 00:15:36.780 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, and
transforming ourselves

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.580 align:middle line:84%
so we can go out into the world
and then change it from there.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I certainly couldn't
agree with you more.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.495 align:middle line:84%
It ultimately has to be
a self-responsibility

00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:45.870 align:middle line:84%
that we are
claiming, that we are

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
allowing for any kind of
healing to happen ultimately.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.580 align:middle line:84%
So what kind of person is it
that is interested in this?

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.600 align:middle line:90%
Who is it?

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it the person sitting
next to us at work?

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.622 align:middle line:90%
Is it our daughter?

00:15:58.622 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:90%
What's happening there?

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.583 align:middle line:90%
Who is this individual?

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So when we
look at both higher

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.790 align:middle line:84%
doses of psychedelics and
microdoses of psychedelics,

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
it's everyone from
across the spectrum.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.740 align:middle line:84%
Now most people, when they
think of psychedelics,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.530 align:middle line:84%
think of the typical person
from the '60s, someone

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.660 align:middle line:84%
who sort of dropped
out of society,

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:90%
who might be called a hippie.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And there are certainly people
who utilize psychedelics

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:90%
who would identify with that.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.655 align:middle line:84%
However, what's also
becoming more and more

00:16:23.655 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
a thing is you have lawyers,
and doctors, and executives,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
and founders, software
engineers, stay-at-home moms,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.680 align:middle line:84%
people who are retired who
are getting into old age

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
and want to help with
improving cognitive function.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Across the spectrum, people
are becoming more and more

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:44.550 align:middle line:84%
interested in psychedelics
for various number of reasons.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Now the way that I usually
categorize this is either

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.420 align:middle line:84%
people are interested
in it for healing

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:53.608 align:middle line:84%
or they're interested in
it for transformation.

00:16:53.608 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And the way that we
distinguish between those two

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.100 align:middle line:84%
is healing is often going
back into your past,

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
going back into what's happened
to you before to heal trauma,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.911 align:middle line:84%
to heal things that have
happened emotionally to you.

00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:06.119 align:middle line:90%
And that's an important part.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
step in doing that.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.000 align:middle line:84%
But once you go through
that healing process,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.869 align:middle line:90%
then you can fully be present.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And then that's where it
becomes great to use these tools

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
for creativity, for leadership,
and for general transformation,

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:84%
where we're looking at the
human potential movement,

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
how can we maximize our
potential as human beings.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is basically
taking a page

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.720 align:middle line:90%
from the playbook of the '60s.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So there was a place
called the Esalen

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.220 align:middle line:84%
which you may be familiar
with, the Esalen Institute--

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:35.550 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.508 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: --in Big Sur.

00:17:36.508 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was built around
the human potential movement,

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.190 align:middle line:84%
particularly around
psychedelics.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
sort of a beacon,

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.230 align:middle line:84%
still, of the human
potential movement.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.080 align:middle line:84%
And now with all of this
conversation that's coming back

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.290 align:middle line:84%
around psychedelics, it's like
we're finally getting a chance

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to restart that conversation
about what it means to fully

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.960 align:middle line:84%
explore self-actualization
and self-transcendence,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:84%
going beyond the self to really
contribute as much as we can.

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And in these
transcendent states,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.225 align:middle line:84%
do the old emotional things
heal coming along with it?

00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.725 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to be
one or the other,

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:16.110 align:middle line:84%
I guess-- does someone
have to be either seeking

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.650 align:middle line:84%
emotional support and
healing, or being interested

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.260 align:middle line:84%
in a transcendent,
transformational experience?

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.195 align:middle line:84%
Or do they kind of
happen simultaneously?

00:18:25.195 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, on
an individual basis,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:90%
they're not mutually exclusive.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.232 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes what
we find in the stories

00:18:31.232 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that people are telling is,
particularly when they're first

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:middle line:84%
starting to work
with psychedelics,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
these transcendent
experiences that allow

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:84%
them to totally kind of have
a new perspective on things

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
allow them to be objective
and honest about things that

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:84%
have happened in their past
that their subconscious or even

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.252 align:middle line:90%
unconscious was keeping hidden.

00:18:50.252 --> 00:18:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And so basically once you start
to go into that unconscious

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:84%
and sort of dig up all the
skeletons from the basement,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
then you can process
them and integrate them.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And then once that has happened,
then it becomes much easier

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:90%
to reach these peak states.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Because there is somewhat of
a danger in just going right

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:90%
to the peak states.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're carrying
all that baggage with you,

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.200 align:middle line:84%
then that's when
we get psychopathy,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
or kind of people
who are in those

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.550 align:middle line:84%
elevated states but are coming
at it from a perspective that

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.310 align:middle line:90%
isn't healthy.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So I think that's why
it's really important

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
that, to start with,
a lot of this process

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:90%
is oriented towards healing.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And then once we feel
like, OK, we feel good,

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.230 align:middle line:84%
then that's when we can go
into the transformation.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fascinating information.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:84%
On that note, let's see, is it
possible to use psychedelics

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
for all of its benefits without
any psychoactive effects?

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to take a look at
the new trend of microdosing.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Perhaps science is still
unable to definitively map

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.410 align:middle line:84%
the neurological
basis of psilocybin,

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
but new advancements are seen
in our understanding of these

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:90%
mushrooms' effects on the brain.

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, to arrive at the
mind-bending and life-changing

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.790 align:middle line:84%
experiences that
they afford, people

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.500 align:middle line:84%
have been left to
secretive methods

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to get their hands
on them, keeping

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:07.000 align:middle line:84%
this age-old sacrament
and its shamanic use

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.358 align:middle line:90%
alive in the underground.

00:20:08.358 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
>>DANIEL MCQUEEN: Mushrooms are
re-colonizing the world right

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.500 align:middle line:90%
now, one basement at a time.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.470 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people are
growing this medicine,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:10%
and are using it with
sacred intention,

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.760 align:middle line:10%
and not speaking
about it very much.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.200 align:middle line:10%
It's a very personal
experience for them.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.840 align:middle line:10%
And people are
cultivating mushrooms

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.330 align:middle line:10%
both for large experiences,
big, spiritual, transpersonal

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:10%
experiences, but people are
also primarily cultivating

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:44.980 align:middle line:10%
this medicine for microdosing,
and using incredibly low doses

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.640 align:middle line:10%
of psilocybin mushrooms,
pretty regularly,

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.120 align:middle line:10%
for the treatment of
depression, anxiety,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:10%
or to provide a little more
energy than they would normally

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:10%
have.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.778 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What is microdosing?

00:21:01.778 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So microdosing
is the consumption

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
of a low dose of a
psychedelic, usually two times

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.360 align:middle line:84%
per week, for a
set period of time,

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.980 align:middle line:90%
like five weeks or 10 weeks.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
When I did it, I did
it for seven months.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.230 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
it's subperceptible.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So you might notice that
there's a slight change in how

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.500 align:middle line:84%
you go about your daily life,
but there's no visual changes.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.010 align:middle line:84%
You kind of feel like
everything's just a little

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
elevated, like everything
sparkles a little bit.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And so basically
the way microdosing

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.640 align:middle line:84%
came about was, in
2012, a guy named

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Jim Fadiman published a
book called "The Psychedelic

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
Explorer's Guide."

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And he included a
chapter in there

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.860 align:middle line:84%
on microdosing that talked
about the experiences

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.570 align:middle line:84%
that people had
with microdosing,

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:90%
a number of anecdotal reports.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:51.570 align:middle line:84%
And then in 2015, he was
on a very popular podcast,

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and that's when it sort of came
out into the cultural sphere

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and you had everyone in Silicon
Valley-- tech executives,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.000 align:middle line:84%
founders-- who
started to microdose

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
to help with productivity, and
creativity, things like that.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So how does that
microdose experience

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.650 align:middle line:84%
differ from the high-dose
experience for the individual?

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.150 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the
best way to explain

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:14.760 align:middle line:84%
the difference between a
microdose and a high dose

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
is, with a high dose, it's like
someone is screaming at you.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.820 align:middle line:84%
They're shaking at you to get
the message of connection,

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.270 align:middle line:90%
of source.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And that can be very
jarring for people at times

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's like a
180 from everyday life.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.590 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with microdosing,
it's like someone

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:90%
is whispering at you.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's soft, and it's calm,
and you can integrate it

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:34.990 align:middle line:90%
on an ongoing basis.

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I like to compare microdosing
to mindfulness meditation.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.620 align:middle line:84%
People are noticing
very similar effects

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.355 align:middle line:84%
when they meditate consistently
as when they microdose.

00:22:43.355 --> 00:22:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that's
really the best way

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to describe the differences
between the two.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And then inside that
microdosing experience,

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
what are people
subjectively reporting?

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.070 align:middle line:84%
What happens inside
of them for that?

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the core
thing to pay attention

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:00.480 align:middle line:84%
to when people
are microdosing is

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.340 align:middle line:84%
they have an enhanced
sense of presence.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's less of a
fixation in the past,

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.940 align:middle line:84%
there's less of a fixation
on the future, both of which

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:84%
are tied to either
depression in the past

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:90%
or anxiety in the future.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's more of an
ability just to be here now,

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.360 align:middle line:84%
to be present with
everything that's going on.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
why so many people

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.590 align:middle line:84%
are microdosing with things
like meditation or yoga,

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.230 align:middle line:84%
because those practices,
when combined,

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:84%
can really help to maintain
that sense of presence.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.220 align:middle line:90%
Now when we scope--

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.880 align:middle line:84%
kind of zoom outside of
that, microdosing people are

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:84%
microdosing to help
with depression,

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.630 align:middle line:84%
they're microdosing
to help with PTSD,

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
they're microdosing to help with
high levels of social anxiety,

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.990 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.365 align:middle line:84%
And then you also
have people who

00:23:44.365 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:84%
are microdosing to
help with creativity,

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.260 align:middle line:84%
to help with leadership,
to help with productivity.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And essentially, when
you're microdosing,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.540 align:middle line:84%
it's just a little
bit easier to access

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.250 align:middle line:90%
what we call a flow state.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:58.368 align:middle line:84%
And so a flow state
is when you get

00:23:58.368 --> 00:23:59.910 align:middle line:84%
in the zone, when
you're able to just

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:84%
drop into what you're doing
and just to be there with it

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:90%
and to go into it.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's when creativity
and productivity combine,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.470 align:middle line:84%
and we're able to really
focus on the project at hand,

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do it
as well as possible.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So what
types of substances

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:84%
do people microdose
specifically?

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.670 align:middle line:84%
What is it that are
most commonly used?

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the two
most common psychedelics

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
that people are microdosing
with are LSD and psilocybin

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.030 align:middle line:90%
mushrooms.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
And people are also microdosing
with cannabis quite a bit.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And people are also
then microdosing

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.640 align:middle line:84%
with some of the
plant medicines.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.660 align:middle line:84%
So this would include things
like iboga and ayahuasca,

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and San Pedro.

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.830 align:middle line:84%
So there's a number of
different substances

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.880 align:middle line:90%
that you can microdose with.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.380 align:middle line:84%
But again, the two most
common are LSD and psilocybin

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.890 align:middle line:90%
mushrooms.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What are the
negative side effects?

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:90%
What are the possible risks?

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:90%
What could happen?

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the biggest
risk with microdosing

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.010 align:middle line:90%
is that it's still illegal.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:84%
So because of its
illegality, whenever

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.870 align:middle line:84%
someone is going and
making the decision

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.370 align:middle line:84%
to microdose with
psychedelics, they

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:13.410 align:middle line:84%
run the risk of issues
with law enforcement.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, that aside, the other
main risk is dependency.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So although psychedelics,
as I mentioned before,

00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.300 align:middle line:90%
are non-addictive--

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.550 align:middle line:84%
so there's no risk of
physical withdrawals--

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.280 align:middle line:84%
there is a risk of
psychological dependency,

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:90%
like there is with most things.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we
teach, for example,

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.110 align:middle line:84%
with our resources
at The Third Wave

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and the course that we have,
is that it's really critical

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that if you start a
microdosing protocol,

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.580 align:middle line:84%
a microdosing routine,
that you combine it

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.460 align:middle line:84%
with other
mindfulness practices,

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.070 align:middle line:90%
again, like meditation or yoga.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And that way, when you
decide to, for example,

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
take a break with
microdosing, you've

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.960 align:middle line:84%
integrated those habits
of yoga or meditation

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.520 align:middle line:84%
so that you continue
to cultivate

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that sense of presence
and awareness,

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.740 align:middle line:84%
and not just tie it to the
drug that you're taking,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.260 align:middle line:84%
the LSD or psilocybin
mushrooms, but actually

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.150 align:middle line:84%
recognize that when
you're microdosing,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.000 align:middle line:84%
it's just acting as a
catalyst for neuroplasticity.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.540 align:middle line:84%
It's acting as a catalyst
to build new habits.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And those habits are typically
oriented around self-care,

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.860 align:middle line:84%
again, because whether it's
a high dose or a microdose,

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.470 align:middle line:84%
that message that we're getting
is about love and self-love.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.323 align:middle line:84%
We want to take care
of ourselves more.

00:26:21.323 --> 00:26:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So that's the best
way to view it.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.520 align:middle line:84%
It's a catalyst, but it's
not something to rely on.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And what it's a catalyst
for is, again, these habits

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:29.760 align:middle line:90%
of better self-care.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.052 align:middle line:90%
So that could be eating better.

00:26:31.052 --> 00:26:32.760 align:middle line:84%
So when people are
microdosing, they

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.260 align:middle line:84%
notice that they start to be
more mindful about what they're

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.450 align:middle line:90%
putting into their body.

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:38.550 align:middle line:84%
They maybe do an extra
rep or two at the gym.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:90%
They go more consistently.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.030 align:middle line:84%
They get a better
night of sleep.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:46.140 align:middle line:84%
So there's something related
to the start of microdosing

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and just general practice of
taking better care of yourself.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.885 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: One substance to
another, different effects?

00:26:52.885 --> 00:26:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Do you use one for this
effect, one for this effect?

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:56.953 align:middle line:90%
Can you speak about that?

00:26:56.953 --> 00:26:58.620 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So the thing
with psychedelics

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.240 align:middle line:90%
is that they're very subjective.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.080 align:middle line:84%
The experience itself
is very subjective.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's really going to differ
from one person to the next.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.770 align:middle line:84%
Now objectively what
we know in terms

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.280 align:middle line:84%
of the differences between LSD
and psilocybin mushrooms is

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.360 align:middle line:84%
LSD lasts for 12 hours,
whereas psilocybin mushrooms

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.610 align:middle line:90%
last for only six hours.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's because LSD
is more dopaminergic,

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.280 align:middle line:84%
which means that it's
doing more with dopamine

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.740 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, which is tied
to drive, and ambition,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
and energy, whereas psilocybin
is more seratonergic,

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:31.920 align:middle line:84%
which is tied to serotonin
in the brain, which is about

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.260 align:middle line:90%
contentment, being present.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So if we extrapolate from
that, what people notice

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.030 align:middle line:84%
is that when they're
microdosing with LSD

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.180 align:middle line:84%
that it's much better for
cognitive-related tasks

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:90%
or projects.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's a big reason
why LSD became so popular

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.960 align:middle line:84%
for microdosing
in Silicon Valley,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.390 align:middle line:84%
because you had a lot of
engineers, and executives,

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and founders who were
utilizing it for creativity

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:84%
and brainstorming
because it helped them

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.490 align:middle line:84%
with the divergent thinking
process, this process of coming

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
up with new ideas from things
that are seemingly not related.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the psilocybin
mushrooms, a lot of people

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.860 align:middle line:84%
are using those
more for therapy,

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:09.930 align:middle line:84%
for emotional healing,
because it allows

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.390 align:middle line:84%
them to get into their body
and to process things that

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.540 align:middle line:90%
have happened.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:16.170 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two main
differences between LSD

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.613 align:middle line:84%
and psilocybin mushrooms
for microdosing.

00:28:18.613 --> 00:28:20.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So "Healing
Matrix" is interested

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.640 align:middle line:84%
in a holistic approach,
like all things considered,

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.040 align:middle line:84%
the whole human gets to
become a self-healer,

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:84%
gets to awaken to
their full potential.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.500 align:middle line:84%
Are there other things that
you recommend for people

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.565 align:middle line:84%
to help support them
when they're going

00:28:33.565 --> 00:28:34.690 align:middle line:90%
through a regime like this?

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Are there nutritional
programs that people

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.700 align:middle line:90%
should be focusing on?

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Are there other types
of daily activities

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
that they should be doing
around this to stabilize

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.940 align:middle line:84%
this kind of
evolutionary experience

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.260 align:middle line:90%
that they're going through?

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So one thing to
bring up right off the bat is,

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.530 align:middle line:84%
microdosing, from my perspective
is really just the lead

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.090 align:middle line:90%
in to a higher dose.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.980 align:middle line:84%
So although there are
a number of benefits

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.740 align:middle line:84%
that can come from microdosing,
from my perspective,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that true paradigm shift in
how we perceive ourselves

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and our relationship
to the world

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.590 align:middle line:90%
can come from higher doses.

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.320 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing to consider.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But beyond that, we're
really looking at just

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:90%
general mindfulness practices.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.050 align:middle line:84%
So one thing we
encourage is, again,

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:84%
microdosing used as
a catalyst to start

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.057 align:middle line:84%
a practice of meditation,
to start a practice of yoga,

00:29:19.057 --> 00:29:20.640 align:middle line:84%
to start being more
mindful about what

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.350 align:middle line:90%
we're putting into our bodies.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.020 align:middle line:84%
I won't prescribe any
sort of specific diet,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.700 align:middle line:84%
but generally eating
things that are fresh,

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.180 align:middle line:84%
that are unprocessed,
that come from plants

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some animals is
generally pretty healthy.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really important
that people perceive

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.880 align:middle line:84%
microdosing, again, not as
just this drug that I'll take

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.740 align:middle line:84%
and that it will fix
all my problems--

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.230 align:middle line:84%
because this is sort of our
context of current health care,

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.030 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.070 align:middle line:84%
We take an antidepressant,
we take an anti-anxiety pill,

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.010 align:middle line:84%
the doctor says, take this,
it'll fix what it needs to,

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and we just rely on that.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.880 align:middle line:84%
We give all our power away
to something outside of us.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.680 align:middle line:84%
What microdosing is about, it's
about bringing that agency,

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
bringing that autonomy
back into ourselves,

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and then leveraging it
to be able to create

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.060 align:middle line:90%
a new way of living.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And again, when we
look at microdosing,

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.640 align:middle line:84%
it's helping to facilitate
neuroplasticity,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.610 align:middle line:84%
habit change, the same thing
that meditation and yoga do.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So combining it with
those practices,

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:84%
people have found it
to be very effective.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.258 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: This coupled with
the intentionality piece of,

00:30:21.258 --> 00:30:23.550 align:middle line:84%
as you're saying, around
ritual and that kind of thing,

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that brings a focal point
to it that truly grounds it

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:90%
for the individual.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Is this what we can assume--
mental, emotional, spiritual

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.365 align:middle line:84%
integration is happening because
you're setting an intention

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:34.240 align:middle line:90%
as you're doing this?

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.640 align:middle line:84%
You're not just
out to party and--

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, and yeah,
that's the most important part,

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:90%
is intention.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.350 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of what we're talking
about right now is integration.

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.350 align:middle line:10%
We haven't even really
talked about preparation.

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:middle line:10%
So before even someone goes
and gets the substance itself,

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.240 align:middle line:10%
how do you prepare
appropriately to be

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.620 align:middle line:10%
able to utilize microdosing.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And then that is coming down
to cultivating self-awareness

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.420 align:middle line:90%
and self-reflection.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.810 align:middle line:84%
So practices like journaling
are really good for that.

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Speaking with a trained
therapist or a friend, just

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:06.120 align:middle line:84%
why are you interested
in microdosing,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.550 align:middle line:84%
why are you interested
in starting this path?

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.240 align:middle line:84%
That process of self-reflection
is a critical component.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't
have that intention,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:17.710 align:middle line:84%
that compass pointing you
in the right direction,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:19.620 align:middle line:84%
then microdosing won't
be near as effective

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.500 align:middle line:84%
as it could be if you just
did a little bit of that work

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.220 align:middle line:84%
beforehand to point yourself
in the right direction.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Where do you see the
trajectory for microdosing?

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.820 align:middle line:90%
Where are we going?

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.170 align:middle line:90%
What's going to happen?

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.533 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: From my perspective?

00:31:33.533 --> 00:31:35.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've already
spoken about the medical use

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.908 align:middle line:84%
of psychedelics and the
clinical use of psychedelics.

00:31:37.908 --> 00:31:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And that will be,
from my perspective,

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.220 align:middle line:84%
the first major push
into mainstream culture,

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:84%
when it starts to be prescribed
to treat PTSD and depression.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.790 align:middle line:84%
But if we're really looking at
true cultural transformation,

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.450 align:middle line:84%
we have to look at,
OK, how do we integrate

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.630 align:middle line:84%
psychedelic substances
outside of institutions,

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:02.080 align:middle line:84%
outside of academia, outside of
research, outside of clinics,

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.030 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's where
microdosing holds the key,

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.600 align:middle line:84%
is if we can get people to
recognize that microdosing

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.770 align:middle line:84%
could be just as
effective as a higher dose

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.130 align:middle line:84%
for cultivating
presence and awareness,

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:middle line:84%
then that's a really easy
bridge for people, culturally,

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.787 align:middle line:84%
to start to understand
the benefits

00:32:23.787 --> 00:32:24.870 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic substances.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.245 align:middle line:84%
Because one of
the risks that you

00:32:26.245 --> 00:32:30.750 align:middle line:84%
carry of looking at beyond
medicalization of psychedelics,

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:33.180 align:middle line:90%
is things can get quite chaotic.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned before,
still in our culture

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.070 align:middle line:84%
there's a distinct lack
of psychedelic literacy.

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So for people to actually
use this responsibly at

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.790 align:middle line:84%
higher doses requires quite a
bit of education beforehand.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with microdosing,
because it's subperceptible--

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:84%
it's basically like a
supplement that you're taking--

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:53.010 align:middle line:84%
it's a much lower-risk
way of being

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:58.500 align:middle line:84%
able to have a lot more
people leverage the benefits

00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.610 align:middle line:90%
of psychedelic substances.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So I think, from my
perspective, that's

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:06.270 align:middle line:84%
the big potential of microdosing
is helping psychedelics

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:10.890 align:middle line:84%
to basically expand outside
of walled institutions

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and into more or less the garden
of the culture that we live in.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.328 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Hmm.

00:33:15.328 --> 00:33:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Are you working with any
scientists or university

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:21.890 align:middle line:84%
researchers to try to
quantify effects, et cetera?

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.550 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: For
microdosing specifically?

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:26.520 align:middle line:84%
So we've done a couple
preliminary studies

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.170 align:middle line:90%
with our community and group.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:84%
We have one researcher who's
part of our organization

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.130 align:middle line:84%
who's been collaborating with
a few other organizations.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And for the most
part, the research

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.840 align:middle line:84%
that's come out about
microdosing so far

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.430 align:middle line:90%
is based on surveys.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So due to the bureaucracy that
surrounds psychedelic research,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.150 align:middle line:84%
because these are still
very illegal compounds,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.360 align:middle line:84%
it's very difficult, and
onerous, and expensive process

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:52.510 align:middle line:90%
to do clinical research.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.927 align:middle line:84%
So this is something that we're
looking at for the future,

00:33:54.927 --> 00:33:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and that a lot of
other institutions

00:33:56.610 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:90%
are currently working on.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.230 align:middle line:84%
But the verdict is
still out, so to say,

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:05.460 align:middle line:84%
about the clinical
applications of microdosing.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Fascinating information.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for sharing
this, so much.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Absolutely.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.008 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You know,
let's take a look.

00:34:11.008 --> 00:34:13.199 align:middle line:84%
What is it like when
you are so connected

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.630 align:middle line:84%
and you're so focused
on the task at hand

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.550 align:middle line:84%
that the whole world
just falls away,

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.159 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to perform
your best without, seemingly,

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.270 align:middle line:90%
any effort.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.617 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a
look at flow states.

00:34:24.617 --> 00:34:26.909 align:middle line:10%
>>BEN GREENFIELD: For me, as
a former collegiate tennis

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:30.270 align:middle line:10%
player, I would experience
flow state when everything

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.340 align:middle line:10%
was going right on the court.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.800 align:middle line:84%
A perfect example
of that would be,

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.840 align:middle line:84%
you look at a different
sport like basketball,

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.780 align:middle line:84%
and how you'd see Michael Jordan
during the playoff games, where

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.650 align:middle line:84%
everything was just
smooth, and happened--

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.449 align:middle line:84%
the way that many
athletes describe it

00:34:45.449 --> 00:34:49.500 align:middle line:84%
is a complete
effortless experience.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.150 align:middle line:90%
You're in the zone.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the highest-level
athletes reportedly find

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:57.330 align:middle line:84%
themselves in the zone during
highly intense moments,

00:34:57.330 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:84%
when training takes over and the
problem-solving mind gets out

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:01.290 align:middle line:90%
of the way.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:04.350 align:middle line:90%


00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: I know about flow states.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.080 align:middle line:84%
How does microdosing influence
or enhance flow states?

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It goes back to that
connection between microdosing

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.710 align:middle line:90%
and presence.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.540 align:middle line:84%
So when we can eliminate
all distractions,

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.140 align:middle line:84%
we have a clear intention
in terms of what we're

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.550 align:middle line:90%
utilizing microdosing for.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.310 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
orient that clarity

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.080 align:middle line:90%
towards a creative project.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important that,
if someone wants to microdose,

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to access a flow state, that
they have a creative project

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that they're
working on that they

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:35.628 align:middle line:90%
can orient that energy towards.

00:35:35.628 --> 00:35:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
microdose, it's kind

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.018 align:middle line:84%
of like putting jet
fuel in your engine,

00:35:39.018 --> 00:35:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and you want to make
sure that that's

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:90%
going in the right direction.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.100 align:middle line:84%
But beyond microdosing, there's
also a few other key elements

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.320 align:middle line:84%
of accessing a flow
state, one of which

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.880 align:middle line:84%
is the task needs to be
difficult enough but not

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.660 align:middle line:84%
too difficult. So there
is often a 5% rule,

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.953 align:middle line:84%
that the task that you're
working on should be about 5%

00:35:59.953 --> 00:36:01.620 align:middle line:84%
more difficult than
what you're used to,

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.215 align:middle line:84%
because then you'll have this
motivation to go in, and figure

00:36:05.215 --> 00:36:06.090 align:middle line:90%
it out, and solve it.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.057 align:middle line:90%
If it's too easy--

00:36:08.057 --> 00:36:10.390 align:middle line:84%
like checking email, you don't
really need a flow state.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.260 align:middle line:84%
But if it's too hard, you just
get frustrated and you give up.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.520 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
find that sweet spot.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.000 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
microdose with that,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.070 align:middle line:84%
that energy that goes
into it is just--

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:20.920 align:middle line:90%
it's fantastic.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's how--

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:25.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, when I started
microdosing back in 2015,

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I initially microdosed because
I was interested in two things.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.160 align:middle line:84%
One was flow states,
creative brainstorming,

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.980 align:middle line:84%
because I was building
this first business that I

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.760 align:middle line:84%
was working on, which was
an online English school.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I microdosed, I
noticed that my ability

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:46.290 align:middle line:84%
to tie together new ideas
and then create something

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.150 align:middle line:90%
cohesive from them happened.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.520 align:middle line:84%
So for example, this
whole even concept

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.350 align:middle line:84%
of the third wave
of psychedelics

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:84%
came about because we were
go into third-wave coffee

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.880 align:middle line:90%
places in Budapest.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.877 align:middle line:84%
Third-wave coffee is
like artisanal coffee.

00:36:58.877 --> 00:37:00.960 align:middle line:84%
It's like when you go to
a cafe, and they give you

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.420 align:middle line:84%
a nice little latte
with a swan in it,

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.800 align:middle line:90%
that's third-wave coffee.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And we were taking
psychedelics--

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:09.302 align:middle line:84%
not at the same time,
on different days,

00:37:09.302 --> 00:37:10.510 align:middle line:90%
but generally there was that.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And then we were walking through
Budapest trying to understand,

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:18.053 align:middle line:84%
what can we kind of term
this new awakening that's

00:37:18.053 --> 00:37:19.220 align:middle line:90%
happening with psychedelics?

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And we came up with a
third wave of psychedelics.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So that divergent
thinking process

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:24.870 align:middle line:90%
is part of the flow state.

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.020 align:middle line:84%
It's pulling in these new
ideas to form and create

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.250 align:middle line:90%
new concepts.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.540 align:middle line:84%
But then the second
thing that I utilized

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.770 align:middle line:84%
microdosing for in
2015 was also to help

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:middle line:84%
with emotional
relationships, was

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.820 align:middle line:84%
to help with connection
and intimacy.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like that's also part
of a flow state, is oftentimes,

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:45.355 align:middle line:84%
when we're in social situations,
we get in our head so much.

00:37:45.355 --> 00:37:47.730 align:middle line:84%
And so when we microdose,
we're able to step out of that,

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:49.522 align:middle line:84%
and just be completely
present with people,

00:37:49.522 --> 00:37:52.667 align:middle line:84%
and get into that sense
of flow in conversation

00:37:52.667 --> 00:37:54.000 align:middle line:90%
and when connecting with others.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two ways
that I perceive our ability

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.860 align:middle line:84%
to leverage flow states
in the modern world.

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And certainly it's
been working for you.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It did when I did
microdosing for seven months.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.890 align:middle line:90%
And that was back in 2015.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And so now, on occasion,
I will microdose,

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.360 align:middle line:84%
but it's not something I
do consistently anymore.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.480 align:middle line:84%
If I'm giving a
public talk or if I

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.780 align:middle line:84%
have a day of brainstorming
where I might go hiking

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.360 align:middle line:90%
for that day, I'll microdose.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.560 align:middle line:84%
But generally now I prefer
meditation and yoga, and then

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.500 align:middle line:84%
the occasional
high-dose psychedelic,

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.140 align:middle line:84%
whether it's ayahuasca, or
mushrooms, or whatever else.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.150 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wow.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Do you consider psychedelics
to be a potential nootropic,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.850 align:middle line:84%
and can you define
that for our viewers.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:45.180 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So a nootropic has
a very specific definition,

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.620 align:middle line:84%
and it basically has
to do with five things.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.980 align:middle line:84%
It has to be non-addictive,
it can be something

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.240 align:middle line:84%
that you can do on
a consistent basis,

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.300 align:middle line:84%
it has to be something that
facilitates neuroplasticity,

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.660 align:middle line:84%
it has to be something
that is natural,

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and there's one other definition
that I don't exactly remember.

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So according to this definition,
most things are not nootropics.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Microdosing could be
considered a new topic.

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But again, you're not doing
it everyday typically.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.810 align:middle line:84%
But if we kind of get away from
the more rigorous definition

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.780 align:middle line:84%
of nootropics and just look
at nootropics as this ability

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.750 align:middle line:84%
to enhance our cognitive
function, from my perspective,

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.858 align:middle line:84%
microdosing is the
ultimate nootropic.

00:39:24.858 --> 00:39:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Because not only is
it helping people

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.190 align:middle line:84%
to focus with flow
states, but it's also

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:84%
bringing in that
element of creativity,

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:32.493 align:middle line:84%
it's bringing in
that element of being

00:39:32.493 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:84%
able to zoom out and see things
from a greater perspective.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And then when you're able
to see things from a greater

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.510 align:middle line:84%
perspective, you can
kind of narrow in

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.360 align:middle line:84%
on what's most important,
and orient your energy

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.040 align:middle line:90%
towards that.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I feel like this is why
microdosing has taken off

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.330 align:middle line:84%
so much in places
like Silicon Valley,

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:55.350 align:middle line:84%
is because before people were
just taking modafinil, which

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.320 align:middle line:84%
is another stimulant,
drinking a ton

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.930 align:middle line:84%
of coffee, using things
like Adderall and Ritalin,

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.330 align:middle line:84%
which are highly addictive and
used to treat ADD and ADHD.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And then when they
found microdosing,

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.618 align:middle line:84%
they noticed that they weren't
stuck in such a tunnel,

00:40:08.618 --> 00:40:10.660 align:middle line:84%
and they didn't have this
sense of tunnel vision,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.785 align:middle line:84%
but they were able to play a
little bit more with the work

00:40:13.785 --> 00:40:14.660 align:middle line:90%
that they were doing.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
why microdosing

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.630 align:middle line:84%
is such a great nootropic,
is because it gets us not

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to take what we're
doing so serious,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.340 align:middle line:84%
but it allows us to play
with what we're doing

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.770 align:middle line:84%
and kind of bring in
that creative element

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.860 align:middle line:90%
so that we can have fun with it.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And when we have fun with
the work that we're doing,

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.540 align:middle line:84%
that's when that real
creativity can blossom.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So this is at the
foundation of our peak

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:37.540 align:middle line:90%
performers.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.310 align:middle line:84%
You're saying that
our peak performers

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:84%
have been microdosing
or have been utilizing

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:46.030 align:middle line:84%
some kind of substance in order
to become the creative front

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.300 align:middle line:90%
leaders that we have.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.100 align:middle line:90%
Is this--

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Many of them.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.810 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say this is
a rule across the board.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But I would say that
many people in the--

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.510 align:middle line:84%
kind of these new
cultural creatives,

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.620 align:middle line:84%
these people who are
going to Burning Man

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:04.060 align:middle line:84%
or going to sound meditations on
the weekend, who are executives

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.610 align:middle line:84%
at major companies,
some of the people

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:09.340 align:middle line:84%
that we recognize as kind
of leaders in the tech world

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:12.070 align:middle line:84%
today, they are
certainly leveraging

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.850 align:middle line:84%
microdosing and higher
doses of psychedelics

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.510 align:middle line:84%
for transformation, and
because of that transformation,

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.633 align:middle line:84%
for things like leadership,
development, creativity.

00:41:23.633 --> 00:41:24.800 align:middle line:90%
You name it and they got it.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of
signifying the transition

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:84%
from the old vanguard, which
was corporations, and hierarchy,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and you do what I tell
you to, and you're

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:84%
going to be a cog
in the machine,

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.420 align:middle line:84%
to this new decentralized
way overseeing work

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.640 align:middle line:90%
and how work develops.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It's much more about
creativity and divergent

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:49.270 align:middle line:84%
thinking rather than focus
and convergent thinking.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And this signifies
this huge transition

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing,
where in the past--

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:58.210 align:middle line:84%
still I would say currently--
the preferred drugs of choice

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.090 align:middle line:84%
are those that facilitate
convergent thinking, tobacco

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:02.640 align:middle line:90%
and caffeine.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And with microdosing
becoming so prevalent,

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that's where we're seeing
this transition from,

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.890 align:middle line:84%
oh, now the preferred drug
of choice are psychedelics.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.320 align:middle line:84%
And those are things that
facilitate divergent thinking,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.080 align:middle line:84%
because we're recognizing
that creativity is going

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:21.610 align:middle line:84%
to be the most valued thing
that we have in the workplace

00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:22.850 align:middle line:90%
going forward.

00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that's the case is

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of the convergent
tasks that require focus

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:84%
are soon going to be taken
over by artificial intelligence

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and automation.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So the people who
basically are creating

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.720 align:middle line:84%
the new stories and
the new narratives

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.170 align:middle line:84%
are reliant on other substances
to help bring those to life.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Can you provide
any case studies

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:46.180 align:middle line:84%
where people have
benefited from microdosing

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:51.353 align:middle line:84%
in terms of practicality,
function, flow, productivity?

00:42:51.353 --> 00:42:53.770 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So probably the best
case study that I know of--

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.740 align:middle line:84%
and this comes from my personal
network-- is a friend of mine

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.080 align:middle line:84%
as a CEO at a
multinational insurance

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.350 align:middle line:90%
company on Wall Street.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's an insurance company,
and it's on Wall Street.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.530 align:middle line:90%
Why is he microdosing?

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.322 align:middle line:84%
Usually we're just
hearing about it, again,

00:43:07.322 --> 00:43:09.580 align:middle line:84%
with Silicon Valley
executives and the tech space.

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:13.120 align:middle line:84%
But this shows how integrated
microdosing has become.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.650 align:middle line:90%
And what he noticed--

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the key thing that he noticed,
outside of just productivity

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and flow states,
is leadership, how

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.620 align:middle line:84%
microdosing allowed him
to be more empathic,

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.373 align:middle line:84%
allowed him to be
a better listener,

00:43:25.373 --> 00:43:27.790 align:middle line:84%
allowed him to really understand
where everyone was coming

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.130 align:middle line:84%
from so that when
he made decisions

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.190 align:middle line:84%
from a strategic perspective,
that he could integrate all

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:84%
those perspectives and make
a decision that everyone felt

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.170 align:middle line:84%
was the right decision for
the team that was involved.

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that
cultivation of empathy

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
is what we're missing in
a lot of executive circles

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.660 align:middle line:84%
today, in corporations
for example, where

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:90%
it's become so dog-eat-dog.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I love that
story about how microdosing

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.100 align:middle line:84%
helped him, is because
that is this new frontier

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.420 align:middle line:90%
of leadership.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: How might
microdosing be used

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.040 align:middle line:84%
in the future as a supplement
beyond medical use?

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So I feel like
the thing that we're

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:08.020 align:middle line:84%
going to see with
microdosing is,

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:84%
as more research comes out
about the efficacy of it,

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.930 align:middle line:84%
is how we can combine it
with other herbs and plants

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.000 align:middle line:90%
to facilitate optimal wellness.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.190 align:middle line:84%
So one example is
Paul Stamets, who's

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:20.920 align:middle line:84%
a world-renowned
mycologist, has talked about

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.370 align:middle line:84%
how, if we combine psilocybin
with lion's mane, which

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:27.250 align:middle line:84%
is a medicinal mushroom, it
will help to facilitate greater

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.480 align:middle line:90%
levels of neuroplasticity.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.570 align:middle line:84%
So from my perspective,
the future of microdosing

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.390 align:middle line:84%
is not just, this is the
drug itself and take it,

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:38.050 align:middle line:84%
but how can we combine
microdosing psilocybin

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:44.170 align:middle line:84%
with rhodiola, or ashwagandha,
or chaga, rishi, lion's mane,

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.720 align:middle line:84%
all these other urban
supplements that we're just

00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.210 align:middle line:84%
starting to learn about,
CBD oil and cannabis.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:84%
What are their
synergistic effects

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:55.000 align:middle line:84%
between microdoses of
psychedelics and all

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.820 align:middle line:84%
these other psychoactive or
non-psychoactive compounds

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.720 align:middle line:84%
that we currently use by
themselves to help be well,

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.310 align:middle line:90%
and healthy, and all that.

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:05.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So what does the future
of psychedelics look like?

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Paul Austin is
also the co-founder

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.253 align:middle line:84%
of a retreat called
Synthesis, where

00:45:13.253 --> 00:45:15.170 align:middle line:84%
people from all over the
world can participate

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:18.560 align:middle line:84%
in a safe, legal, and
life-changing psychedelic

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.150 align:middle line:90%
experience in Amsterdam.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:21.954 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:21.954 --> 00:45:23.760 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.730 align:middle line:10%
>>AUSTIN: Synthesis started
because, as we explored

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.770 align:middle line:10%
different retreat
options around the world,

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:30.960 align:middle line:10%
we came to understand that
there wasn't a retreat

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.660 align:middle line:10%
option available for
those who wanted to use it

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.050 align:middle line:10%
in a Western modern context.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to create a retreat
in Amsterdam, a city that's

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.110 align:middle line:84%
connected from all
over the world,

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.830 align:middle line:84%
so that professionals who
wanted to use psychedelics

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:49.595 align:middle line:90%
in a moderate context can do so.

00:45:49.595 --> 00:45:50.970 align:middle line:10%
>>MARTIJN SCHIRP:
These tools can

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.590 align:middle line:10%
act as a powerful catalyst for
psychological transformation

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.030 align:middle line:10%
and personal growth.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.590 align:middle line:84%
What we have found
is that people

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.980 align:middle line:84%
come here looking for
creative insights and a better

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:06.020 align:middle line:84%
understanding of where they
come from, who they are,

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.930 align:middle line:90%
and who they might become.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And we wanted to
create an experience where

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.040 align:middle line:84%
people could come to
utilize psilocybin

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.475 align:middle line:84%
truffles in a legal,
safe, modern context.

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Where did
you get the idea

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:21.830 align:middle line:84%
to create a retreat
such as this?

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:23.810 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So when I
was doing all the stuff

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:26.420 align:middle line:84%
around microdosing
and it was becoming

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.130 align:middle line:84%
trendy in tech and
business circles,

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.600 align:middle line:84%
I was asked to speak at a
number of tech and business

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.400 align:middle line:90%
conferences.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.370 align:middle line:90%
And this was in mid-2017.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.317 align:middle line:84%
So there was a tech
conference in Amsterdam,

00:46:36.317 --> 00:46:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and then there was also
a South by Southwest

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:39.720 align:middle line:90%
Conference in Frankfurt.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And I was there
with my co-founder.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And we were trying
to go and understand

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.240 align:middle line:84%
what service can we
offer these people where

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.490 align:middle line:84%
they would actually
want to go and have

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.630 align:middle line:90%
a psychedelic experience.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.892 align:middle line:84%
Because we looked at a lot
of the other retreats that

00:46:52.892 --> 00:46:54.350 align:middle line:84%
were out there,
and we didn't think

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.225 align:middle line:84%
they really resonated
with the type of people

00:46:56.225 --> 00:46:57.610 align:middle line:90%
that we were speaking to.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:46:59.750 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
started Synthesis.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.670 align:middle line:84%
We knew that psilocybin
truffles, which

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.940 align:middle line:84%
are very similar to mushrooms,
were legal in the Netherlands.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.860 align:middle line:90%
My co-founder is Dutch.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.080 align:middle line:90%
So we had that lead-in there.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that if we
created an experience that

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.770 align:middle line:84%
had a sort of corporate
touch, that we could attract

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:20.150 align:middle line:84%
a lot of these people that
we were having a relationship

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:24.380 align:middle line:84%
with at conferences to have
not a microdose experience,

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.880 align:middle line:90%
but a high-dose experience.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.713 align:middle line:84%
And that was the initial
genesis of the idea.

00:47:30.713 --> 00:47:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So might this be
a solution for someone

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.340 align:middle line:84%
who wants to
experience psychedelics

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.220 align:middle line:84%
but doesn't want to go to
a shaman in South America,

00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.618 align:middle line:90%
ayahuasca, that kind of thing?

00:47:38.618 --> 00:47:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Yeah, a
lot of people, when

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.730 align:middle line:84%
they hear about ayahuasca and
kind of the shamanistic aspect,

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:46.123 align:middle line:84%
it's very different from a
typical Western approach.

00:47:46.123 --> 00:47:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we really wanted to
create an experience that

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.600 align:middle line:84%
was more approachable,
to minimize

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.670 align:middle line:84%
some of the objections
or resistance

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.045 align:middle line:90%
to trying psychedelics.

00:47:54.045 --> 00:47:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Now when you combine
that with the fact

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:58.910 align:middle line:84%
that there was a ton of
clinical research on psilocybin

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:84%
in particular, which is what
we're offering at the retreat

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:05.540 align:middle line:84%
center, that combination has
attracted a specific type

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:08.060 align:middle line:84%
of person who
doesn't necessarily

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.300 align:middle line:84%
want to go down to the
jungle for two weeks

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and work with
ayahuasca, which tends

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:16.540 align:middle line:84%
to come with a lot of purging
and a lot of difficulty.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Instead they want to have
that first experience be

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.320 align:middle line:84%
quite nice and
comfortable while still

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.100 align:middle line:90%
being very transformative.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And so we found that our
experience and the retreat

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:30.260 align:middle line:84%
that we've put together really
resonates with that sort

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:31.490 align:middle line:90%
of crowd and audience.

00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:33.980 align:middle line:84%
And they come, they
have great experiences,

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:90%
and they go back home.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And the whole time, it's safe,
it's modern, it's comfortable.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And for a lot of
them, it's legal.

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
important part.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.350 align:middle line:84%
The legal part-- a lot of
people have a lot of fear

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.350 align:middle line:90%
around it being illegal.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:46.730 align:middle line:90%
What if I get caught?

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:47.950 align:middle line:90%
What would happen then?

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:49.050 align:middle line:90%
So we totally remove that.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:51.170 align:middle line:84%
We say, this is totally
legal, come here,

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:52.348 align:middle line:90%
we'll take care of you.

00:48:52.348 --> 00:48:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's been very
attractive for people.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Which sets
up the experience.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.060 align:middle line:84%
If that fear or dissonance
about it being illegal--

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.880 align:middle line:84%
it kind of precedes
the experience itself,

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.770 align:middle line:84%
it has kind of a
negative connotation.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:07.670 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Because that
preparation, that priming,

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.770 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics are
non-specific amplifiers.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So they'll just amplify
how you're already feeling.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.865 align:middle line:84%
And so if you go into an
experience with a lot of fear,

00:49:15.865 --> 00:49:17.490 align:middle line:84%
then that's just
going to be amplified.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So we have to minimize
that as much as possible,

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.310 align:middle line:84%
and really get people something
positive to look forward to.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.640 align:middle line:90%
That's really the core of it.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And the importance
of setting the intention.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.120 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Right.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Why is it in Amsterdam?

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.563 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: It's an Amsterdam
because it's legal there.

00:49:32.563 --> 00:49:33.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
really one of the--

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that's the only Western country
where psychedelics are legal.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Every other Western country,
every psychedelic is illegal.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we wanted to pick the
Netherlands and Amsterdam

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:49.010 align:middle line:84%
in particular because it's a
Western country, because it has

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:52.490 align:middle line:84%
a Western culture, and we
wanted to first incubate

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.140 align:middle line:90%
that experience there.

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And then as psychedelics
become medicalized

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and has they potentially become
regulated to some degree,

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:84%
then we've built a model
in the Netherlands,

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.230 align:middle line:84%
where we can expand
it elsewhere.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And we can have the
blueprint of what's

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:12.890 align:middle line:84%
an effective, safe, legal
psychedelic experience like?

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And then when that becomes
accessible elsewhere,

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.670 align:middle line:90%
we already know what to do.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And that, combined with the fact
that my co-founder was Dutch,

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:21.620 align:middle line:84%
also made the
process quite easy,

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.160 align:middle line:84%
because he could just help
with the transition in a really

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.180 align:middle line:90%
effective way.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Do you see such clinics
or retreats such as Synthesis

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.880 align:middle line:84%
ever developing here
in the United States?

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: So right now,
the closest thing to that

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.010 align:middle line:84%
is ketamine
psychotherapy clinics.

00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Ketamine is now legal.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And so these
psychotherapy clinics

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.550 align:middle line:84%
are opening to help
with clinical issues.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of our
approach at Synthesis,

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:49.610 align:middle line:84%
our approach at Synthesis,
we do not treat any clinical.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:52.550 align:middle line:84%
It's purely for people who
are interested in peak states,

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.230 align:middle line:90%
for transformation.

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:58.010 align:middle line:84%
That will be a number of years
before it's feasible, again,

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:00.200 align:middle line:90%
because of the illegal nature.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.740 align:middle line:84%
But if cannabis
is any indication,

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.220 align:middle line:90%
then that time will come.

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.600 align:middle line:84%
And when that time
comes, our hope

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.780 align:middle line:84%
is that we will have
built a model that

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.830 align:middle line:84%
is really effective
at helping people

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.290 align:middle line:84%
to have these
experiences in a very

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.365 align:middle line:84%
safe, modern,
transformative way.

00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what
do you anticipate

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.630 align:middle line:84%
with this legalization
of psychedelics?

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:23.655 align:middle line:90%
What would happen?

00:51:23.655 --> 00:51:25.280 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: Well, I
think the first step,

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:28.970 align:middle line:84%
even before legalization,
will be decriminalization.

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So with cannabis becoming legal,
most of the infrastructure

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:37.880 align:middle line:84%
that has supported the war on
drugs, which is criminalizing

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.830 align:middle line:84%
drugs, essentially,
that are illegal,

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.770 align:middle line:84%
has gone to support the
enforcement of cannabis.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I think something like 90% of
arrests come from cannabis.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So once cannabis becomes legal,
then the entire infrastructure

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:54.200 align:middle line:84%
that supported the war on drugs
will become financially not

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.543 align:middle line:90%
feasible anymore.

00:51:55.543 --> 00:51:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you combine that
with the fact that countries

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.350 align:middle line:84%
like Portugal,
which decriminalized

00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:05.000 align:middle line:84%
all drugs in 1999 in response
to a heroin crisis, that looks

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.500 align:middle line:84%
quite attractive to public
health professionals,

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:10.190 align:middle line:84%
especially in the midst of an
opiate crisis, where they go,

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:13.460 align:middle line:84%
we have a model that works,
cannabis is fully legal,

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.130 align:middle line:84%
why not decriminalize all
drugs across the board?

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:18.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think that will be
the first thing to happen.

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:21.002 align:middle line:84%
And once you
decriminalize all drugs

00:52:21.002 --> 00:52:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and you have all the medical
benefits of psychedelics

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:28.130 align:middle line:84%
that are shown, then there will
be a clear cultural container

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:32.360 align:middle line:84%
created to be able to regulate
these substances in a way

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that people can use them with
intention and responsibility.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:38.450 align:middle line:90%
How many years might that be?

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I think, at the very
minimum, seven to eight years

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.150 align:middle line:84%
in terms of looking
at decriminalization.

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.730 align:middle line:84%
It could be longer, 10 to 15
years for a full regulated

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:48.530 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:51.290 align:middle line:84%
But I do strongly believe that
we're well on our way there.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:53.960 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter of time,
and energy, and effort.

00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: In the meantime,
building safe,

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:58.550 align:middle line:84%
structured ways to
train people to behave

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.230 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of
such practices so

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.810 align:middle line:84%
that they do
integrate with ease,

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:04.142 align:middle line:90%
with grace, in their lives.

00:53:04.142 --> 00:53:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: And building those
communities around that,

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.300 align:middle line:84%
so when they come back
from these experiences,

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.818 align:middle line:84%
they don't feel like, oh
man, this is so alien,

00:53:11.818 --> 00:53:13.610 align:middle line:84%
but they feel like,
oh, I have a community,

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:15.068 align:middle line:84%
I have people I
can speak to, I can

00:53:15.068 --> 00:53:18.890 align:middle line:84%
talk about this
with my family, I

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:21.470 align:middle line:84%
have friends who understand
where I'm coming from.

00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Because that was even one
of the big challenges for me

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.770 align:middle line:84%
when I first
started working with

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:25.937 align:middle line:90%
psychedelics nine years ago.

00:53:25.937 --> 00:53:28.025 align:middle line:84%
Everyone was like,
Paul, you're crazy,

00:53:28.025 --> 00:53:29.150 align:middle line:90%
what are you talking about?

00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And now people are
like, oh, we're

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:33.980 align:middle line:90%
finally starting to get it.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So I think that is the
most important thing

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.830 align:middle line:84%
is, as more and more
people wake up to this,

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:43.730 align:middle line:84%
how do we create those
communities to support

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.620 align:middle line:90%
a real healing process--

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Integration and
grounding of the whole thing.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:48.770 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Right.

00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:49.220 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.020 align:middle line:90%
>>AUSTIN: Exactly.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.088 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: So, so important to know.

00:53:52.088 --> 00:53:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's hear from some
of the attendees

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:56.212 align:middle line:84%
from the Synthesis retreat
center in Amsterdam.

00:53:56.212 --> 00:53:57.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The option of being able
to do it legally so that I

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any of that energy
inside of me in my first

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:12.380 align:middle line:84%
experience that might otherwise
have induced some anxiety,

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.930 align:middle line:90%
some resistance, some paranoia.

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Having that opened
and removed completely

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.380 align:middle line:84%
made it a very
different experience,

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.380 align:middle line:84%
I think, than it might
have otherwise been.

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.030 align:middle line:84%
>> The facilitators
were very supportive.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:30.480 align:middle line:90%
And so with every step of the--

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.170 align:middle line:84%
I guess the ceremony and the
retreat, it was accounted for,

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:40.220 align:middle line:90%
and you felt safe and supported.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience of doing
psychedelics in a group,

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.050 align:middle line:84%
for me, was very
personally liberating.

00:54:45.050 --> 00:54:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I was able to give
myself permission

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:52.136 align:middle line:84%
to be me, to experience
my experience,

00:54:52.136 --> 00:54:56.240 align:middle line:90%
and Knowing that I wasn't alone.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That's profound.

00:54:57.930 --> 00:54:59.810 align:middle line:90%
It's profound, yeah.

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So you say that you're
aimed at creating

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.290 align:middle line:90%
a culture around psychedelics.

00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Can you say something
about that for us.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:08.600 align:middle line:84%
>>AUSTIN: For me, that comes
back to psychedelic literacy.

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:12.320 align:middle line:84%
It means that even if people
don't have an interest in doing

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.450 align:middle line:84%
psychedelics, that they
at least understand

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:18.305 align:middle line:84%
that these substances are
safe, that they're effective,

00:55:18.305 --> 00:55:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and that they're
non-addictive, and that they

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:23.150 align:middle line:84%
have the potential
to truly transform.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And that process of psychedelic
literacy, first of all,

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.940 align:middle line:90%
destigmatizes the substances.

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.750 align:middle line:84%
But second of all, it helps
to create a culture that

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:35.785 align:middle line:84%
is comfortable with
spirituality, that

00:55:35.785 --> 00:55:37.160 align:middle line:84%
is comfortable
with understanding

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.180 align:middle line:84%
that these substances
can facilitate source

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
connection, divine connection,
and that from that experience

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.800 align:middle line:84%
we can inform the way that
we build our families,

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.260 align:middle line:84%
we can inform the way that
we build our organizations,

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.150 align:middle line:84%
we can inform the
way that we build

00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:54.420 align:middle line:90%
our cultural infrastructure.

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And that, for me, is
that larger container.

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:01.940 align:middle line:10%
It's what do we take
back from the experience,

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.520 align:middle line:10%
and then how do we contribute
that new-found perspective

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:10.070 align:middle line:10%
in building a new world that
isn't toxic and poisonous,

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:13.342 align:middle line:10%
but that truly supports the
well-being of the individual.

00:56:13.342 --> 00:56:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Thank you, Paul.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm very excited to see how
the conversation evolves

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:19.880 align:middle line:84%
