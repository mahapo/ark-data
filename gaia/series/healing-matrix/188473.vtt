>>SUE MORTER: We often hear
the term muscle memory.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.420 align:middle line:10%
Well, it turns out that it's
not only our muscles that store

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.550 align:middle line:10%
memories but our entire body--

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:10%
muscles, organs, blood
vessels, and more.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And when we experience
traumatic events,

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
our bodies hold onto and
suppress these experiences

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:84%
in ways that often result
in pain and disease.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Jonathan Tripodi, a
physical therapist,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.730 align:middle line:84%
developed a body work program
called Body Memory Recall,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.640 align:middle line:84%
which facilitates the body's
innate ability to release

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and heal old wounds.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
BMR, as it's known, has
helped countless people

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.720 align:middle line:84%
to come out of survival mode
and enter a self-healing state,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:84%
restoring them to
renewed health, vitality,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.120 align:middle line:90%
and fulfillment.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.920 align:middle line:10%
Welcome, Jonathan.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.170 align:middle line:10%
>>JONATHAN TRIPODI: Thank you.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's so great
to have you here.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:84%
Can you just tell us
a little bit about,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
what is body memory
to begin with?

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.260 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Yeah.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.580 align:middle line:10%
Concisely, I would say body
memory is those experiences

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.670 align:middle line:10%
from our past that
we experienced

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.080 align:middle line:10%
as overwhelming or painful
that we suppressed as a way

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:10%
to survive.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
The suppression is not only
in the mind but in the body.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And when did you first
learn about body memory?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: I'd just got out
of physical therapy school,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
and I attended a
myofascial release workshop

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:90%
by John Barnes.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was during that
workshop, through the practice

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.610 align:middle line:84%
of techniques, that I
accessed some body memory.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And how does a
person develop body memory?

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Just
being human, we have

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.580 align:middle line:84%
experiences that are
overwhelming and painful

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:90%
throughout our life.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:10%
The ones that occurred in our
childhood we often forget.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:10%
But the ones that we
experience in adulthood

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:10%
are the ones we remember.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
But all these experiences
we cope with and survive

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:90%
in a very automated way.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't think about it.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:90%
We just survive it.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And by surviving
it, we suppress it.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we
begin to accumulate

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.737 align:middle line:90%
body memory over a lifetime.

00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:31.570 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: And so how does
somebody know if they

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.730 align:middle line:10%
have this happening with them?

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:84%
What are the symptoms that
would reveal, giving someone

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
the notion that maybe
something's being held

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
in my system here that's keeping
me from moving forward in life?

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Pain is the
most obvious symptom.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:84%
When we suppress memory, memory
actually consists of energy.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.960 align:middle line:84%
So when energy isn't
flowing through the body,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.390 align:middle line:90%
it's creating tension.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And tension over time creates
inflammation and pain.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:10%
So any place in your body that
is painful and chronically

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.790 align:middle line:10%
painful is a good
sign that there's

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.980 align:middle line:10%
a body memory source behind it.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:10%
There's also emotional sources,
like anxiety and depression,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.410 align:middle line:10%
certainly digestive issues,
breathing problems, circulatory

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:10%
or neurological conditions.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Because body memory
is cellular, it

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.140 align:middle line:84%
can affect every aspect of our
anatomy and creates symptoms.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So we go through
a traumatic experience.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
Our body has a memory
of that experience

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:90%
and reacts in some way.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
If it gets stuck in that
pattern of reaction,

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.808 align:middle line:84%
then we're stuck right there
as a memory pattern running us.

00:03:39.808 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Is this basically
what you're saying?

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: You're
absolutely right.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.450 align:middle line:90%
And the keyword is reaction.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:90%
And the reaction is fear.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.310 align:middle line:84%
When we're overwhelmed,
we become afraid.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the fear
mechanism is what

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
creates the defensive
protective responses that

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.540 align:middle line:84%
begin to store what we're afraid
of, the sensations or emotions,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.508 align:middle line:90%
into our body.

00:04:00.508 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: So it's
producing chemistries,

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and it's producing neurological
patterns, et cetera.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Is that what's happening here?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Exactly.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you've survived
a memory, that's

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.870 align:middle line:90%
different than healing it.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So we continue to remain in
survival mode, even years

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:90%
after the original events occur.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And we also adapt to them,
so they become normal.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But our body, like you
say, almost like a circuit,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.130 align:middle line:84%
like a program that's just being
played over and over again,

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.210 align:middle line:84%
is this reaction and defense
to something that was painful.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I think it's really
key to say here twice that you

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:90%
can survive a memory.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't necessarily
mean that you've healed it.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
If we got through,
it doesn't mean

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.030 align:middle line:84%
that we've turned on a different
form of our body's function.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:84%
But rather, we could be
locked into this pattern

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.250 align:middle line:84%
of defensiveness or fight
or flight or survival

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.070 align:middle line:84%
mechanism that kicks in
during the middle of a trauma

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:90%
or some unwanted experience.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:90%
Is this--

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Yes.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: --tracking here?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.550 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: And if I
were to then define,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.150 align:middle line:84%
what is a healed memory, it's
one in which you're no longer

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.800 align:middle line:90%
protecting yourself from it.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:90%
You're at peace with it.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.220 align:middle line:84%
There's no evidence
in your mind or body.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.655 align:middle line:90%
You're no longer in reaction.

00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:11.530 align:middle line:90%
You're not hardening.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.662 align:middle line:90%
You're not tensing.

00:05:12.662 --> 00:05:13.870 align:middle line:90%
You're not overwhelmed by it.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:90%
You can talk about it.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:90%
You could cry about it.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.920 align:middle line:84%
But you're not in
protection around it.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.550 align:middle line:84%
You've had this
firsthand experience

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.335 align:middle line:84%
of the importance of going
back to a moment in time

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:26.927 align:middle line:84%
and working it out
differently than how

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:84%
you got through the first
time, with this accident

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.927 align:middle line:90%
that you were sharing.

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
Can you just give us a
little detail about that

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.830 align:middle line:84%
and show us how
that worked for you?

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Well, at age
21, I developed blood clots

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.160 align:middle line:90%
in my right leg.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And blood clots embolized
and went to my heart

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:90%
and then to my lung.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.030 align:middle line:90%
And it almost killed me.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I
survived, and I was told

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:90%
it would never happen again.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.250 align:middle line:84%
Six months later, I had massive
blood clotting in my right leg.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.830 align:middle line:84%
So that really
sidelined me in my life.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
I was taken out of
college, and I was in bed.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was given a prognosis
that was pretty sad.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I was going to have
degenerative effects in my leg

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
that would cause it to swell and
eventually lead to amputation.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.320 align:middle line:84%
So fast forward a few more
years later, at age 25, 26,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I get out of physical
therapy school,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and I discover myofascial
release and its ability

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.450 align:middle line:84%
to help you access
memory in your body.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And I began to access
many memories in my body

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.510 align:middle line:84%
but specifically, the one
related to a car accident

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.620 align:middle line:90%
at age five.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I was walking across the
road to pick up a ball,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and a car driven by a drunk
driver going 40 miles an hour

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
hit me and threw my body
into a neighbor's driveway,

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and I was dead.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:90%
My right leg was fractured.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:90%
I had broken bones in my ribs.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:84%
My mother heard the thud and
came out and resuscitated me

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.670 align:middle line:90%
and brought me back to life.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And as a young kid,
you bounce back.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But what I hadn't
realized until age 26, 27,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:84%
when I started getting
body memory work done

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
to my body, specifically
this right leg,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:84%
I started to access these
memories of the accident.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:84%
The more I cleared
these memories

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.320 align:middle line:84%
of the accident and a
lot of childhood emotions

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that had been
suppressed, the swelling

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.330 align:middle line:84%
in my leg from all
the blood clots

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.260 align:middle line:84%
began to go down and
eventually disappear entirely.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And there was about a
15-year healing process

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
that led to a very
healthy right leg--

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.800 align:middle line:90%
no degeneration, no amputation.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it helped me to
discover these innate healing

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
abilities that we all
have to transform our past

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and get it out of our body and
actually regenerate ourselves.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
What would you say happens
when we start to clear

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:90%
the effects of these memories?

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.930 align:middle line:84%
What is it that's
happening there?

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.597 align:middle line:90%
How is that unfolding?

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
How does healing
happen because you're

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.498 align:middle line:90%
clearing a memory pattern?

00:08:06.498 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: What happens is
these memories that we store

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.490 align:middle line:84%
really are creating chaos
and stress in our body.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.190 align:middle line:84%
We're taking a painful
or stressful experience

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle line:84%
and taking that,
encapsulating it in some way,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:90%
and storing it in our body.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.790 align:middle line:90%
So our body's reacting to it.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.380 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
physical tensions.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But also, neurologically,
it creates stress.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
release body memory,

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:90%
you're releasing stress.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
immediate effects is

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.690 align:middle line:84%
that you find you become
more calm and more

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.320 align:middle line:84%
peaceful with each
memory that's released.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Also, your body
becomes more relaxed.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The tension that was created
from these memories is gone.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And so now those
muscles, that tight neck

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and the tight jaw
and the tight back

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and those painful places in your
body aren't hurting anymore.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Why would you think it
necessary for a person to dive

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.720 align:middle line:84%
in and clear these
things, these body

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:84%
memories, if they're not
having particular symptoms

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:90%
or patterns?

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Is there a benefit
to that as well?

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Yeah.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily have
to have physical symptoms

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.120 align:middle line:84%
or overt chronic pain to
be carrying body memory.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.340 align:middle line:84%
You can begin to look at
your life on other levels,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:90%
like emotionally and mentally.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.720 align:middle line:90%
So the idea is, are you happy?

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.330 align:middle line:90%
Are you fulfilled?

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like you are being
guided by a sense of purpose

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:90%
in this life?

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Are you able to give
and receive love freely?

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like you have
a wise part of your nature

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.620 align:middle line:84%
that is guiding
you in your life,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
or are you constantly
relying on your intellect

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.940 align:middle line:84%
and your logical memory
mind to figure things out?

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: That's huge.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.540 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: And so
body memory impacts

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.740 align:middle line:84%
this on every level-- physical,
emotional, your heart,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.720 align:middle line:90%
your voice, your spirit.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And so releasing
body memory can begin

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:01.440 align:middle line:84%
to help you reconnect
with and reaccess

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.660 align:middle line:84%
these parts of your
nature and bring them

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:90%
to a level of full potential.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Perfect.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.140 align:middle line:84%
What is necessary to
clear these patterns?

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.230 align:middle line:90%
How do we do that?

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.563 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: First, we have to
get conscious of what we're

00:10:13.563 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:84%
unconscious of, because
when we store body memory,

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:84%
part of the protective
mechanism is that we disconnect

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:90%
our awareness.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't know it's there.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.930 align:middle line:90%
We feel pretty good.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.490 align:middle line:90%
You don't-- right?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
But the challenge is, that helps
us to survive but not to heal,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.960 align:middle line:90%
as you mentioned earlier.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.000 align:middle line:84%
So first step is to reconnect
awareness to your body.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Feel into your body and
begin to get access.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like in there?

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:90%
Is it tense?

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.670 align:middle line:90%
Is it stressful?

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.470 align:middle line:90%
Is it scary?

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it sad?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Is it happy?

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:84%
How does it really feel to be
in your body, in your neck,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.470 align:middle line:90%
in your belly, in your heart?

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.000 align:middle line:90%
What does it feel like?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
in this process,

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
as you begin to connect with
these fears that are protecting

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.070 align:middle line:84%
you from events in your
past, now the next step

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:84%
is to overcome the fear, meaning
let go of the protection.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Start to surrender to
what it is that you

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:84%
were previously afraid of,
and maybe currently afraid of.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And as you do that, the
self-healing process

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.990 align:middle line:90%
starts to take place.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And the very thing that you've
been protecting yourself from,

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and specifically,
physical sensations

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.570 align:middle line:84%
that are painful
and emotions, when

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:84%
you begin to overcome
that fear, those energies

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
of those sensations and
emotions come up to the surface.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And they simply have one
agenda, to be accepted,

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.270 align:middle line:90%
felt, and released.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And in that process,
your body may shake.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.440 align:middle line:90%
It could tremble.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:90%
It could twitch.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.530 align:middle line:90%
It can get hot or cold.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, all forms of emotion
can come to the surface.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And I often let people
know that if you

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
want to see a perfect model
of what it is to release body

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:90%
memory, observe a two-year-old.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Look at these young
kids before they have

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.120 align:middle line:90%
learned to be afraid to feel.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Watch how they fluidly express
their joy and their pain,

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
their fear and their sadness,
how it just rolls through them.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:90%
They feel it and they move on.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.530 align:middle line:90%
They go from being absolutely--

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:90%
they skinned their knee.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.280 align:middle line:90%
They're in pain.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.850 align:middle line:90%
They're frightened.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
They're sad.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.670 align:middle line:90%
They feel it, they release it.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:90%
They get up and go play again.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:36.370 align:middle line:10%
So this is what we're
up against as adults,

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:10%
is revisiting these fears
around sensation and emotion

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.690 align:middle line:10%
and talking ourself
into, maybe it's

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.150 align:middle line:10%
going to be OK if I can
just let myself feel it.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.950 align:middle line:90%
Does it hurt?

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it does.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
What happens as the hurt
leaves your body is you

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:90%
begin to transform the hurt.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
You become more free of it,
and you become at peace.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes our
pains from our past

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:84%
have lessons, little
insights, things to teach us.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And we don't get
access to those lessons

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.990 align:middle line:84%
when it's still being
protected and defended.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: I do similar
work to this.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:10%
And one of the things that
people initially will say

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.220 align:middle line:10%
is that they don't
want to feel the pain.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:10%
I'm always encouraging
them to get in their body

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:10%
and not be in
their head so much.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.280 align:middle line:10%
And people are like, well,
it doesn't feel good.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So can you offer
some suggestions

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to our viewers that
might be thinking,

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.300 align:middle line:84%
you know, I'm always trying
to get away from this pain

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.100 align:middle line:90%
that I'm feeling.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And now you're telling
me I should drop in there

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:39.190 align:middle line:90%
and feel it.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.050 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.057 align:middle line:90%
How?

00:13:41.057 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Well,
first I want to honor

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.030 align:middle line:90%
the fact that we are afraid.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't make you
broken or a failure or wrong.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:90%
It makes you human.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.620 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be able to start
to cultivate some compassion

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:90%
for what it is to be human.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And it's not easy.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
We have capacity, an
emotional capacity,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.960 align:middle line:90%
to feel things very deeply.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And that can be
overwhelming at times.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.320 align:middle line:90%
So the fear is very natural.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.550 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
bring to the world

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and help people to realize, as
it was brought to my attention

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.130 align:middle line:84%
way back when, is that you
also have another potential.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And that potential
is transformation.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:84%
There's a part of
your nature that

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.120 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely fearless, wise,
and loving and compassionate.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And we lose touch with
that part of our nature

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.620 align:middle line:84%
when we get too obsessed
with what we're afraid of.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And we identify with our
fear as if that's me.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm a fearful person.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I would say, yes, you
are capable of fear.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:51.550 align:middle line:84%
But I want to let you know that
there is a part of your nature

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.030 align:middle line:84%
that isn't afraid,
and it's ready to help

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.310 align:middle line:84%
you transform everything
that ever happened

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
to you in your life and restore
you to a very vital, healthy,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:84%
and powerful place
so you can begin

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.500 align:middle line:84%
leading your life from a place
of purpose and fulfillment

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:90%
rather than in defense and fear.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important time
in our culture for people

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
to identify that
they can transform

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
these painful, fearful
patterns like never before.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.970 align:middle line:90%
It's upon us at this time.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:28.208 align:middle line:84%
So what is science having to
say in support of this paradigm

00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:29.250 align:middle line:90%
that you're working with?

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.500 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Science is just
skyrocketing right now

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.560 align:middle line:90%
on this topic.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And so I can hardly
keep up with it.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But I will say that the
field of biophysics, which

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.630 align:middle line:84%
developed in the
1950s, has produced

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
a lot of real
scientific information

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:50.910 align:middle line:84%
about how our biology
and energy are merged.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
So prior to then, biology
was just studying the body,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:84%
and physics was just
studying energy.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:84%
When they merged
together, now we're

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.420 align:middle line:84%
starting to measure
energy in the body.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:10%
There is the International
Fascial Conference,

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:08.970 align:middle line:10%
and it's bringing together
people who are scientists,

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.295 align:middle line:10%
as well as therapists,
psychologists,

00:16:12.295 --> 00:16:15.030 align:middle line:10%
and it's bringing to
light how specifically

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.000 align:middle line:10%
the fascial system,
but how that interfaces

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.210 align:middle line:10%
with the rest of the body,
and how this system conducts

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:24.690 align:middle line:10%
energy, suppresses
energy to survive,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.450 align:middle line:10%
but also can get
reaccess to this energy

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:32.490 align:middle line:10%
through the manipulation of that
tissue and bring about healing.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: So I liken the
fascial patterning

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.370 align:middle line:10%
as this cloth that
has threads running

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:10%
in a variety of
different directions.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it gets torqued or
squeezed or stretched and held

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.050 align:middle line:84%
in that way, it doesn't allow
the energy to run through that.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.253 align:middle line:84%
Is this kind of the perspective
that you're working with to--

00:16:51.253 --> 00:16:52.170 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Absolutely.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:84%
So what we're really looking
at, when we look at our body

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
from an energetic perspective,
is that this entire body, all

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.680 align:middle line:84%
its tissues, all its
cells, and the fluids

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:84%
are combining to be a
conductor of energy.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.060 align:middle line:84%
It conducts many
different forms of energy.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
And it also has the capacity
to store that information

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.490 align:middle line:84%
in the form of energy
and reaccess it later.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's the memory component.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.319 align:middle line:84%
But literally, every
aspect of our anatomy

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.573 align:middle line:84%
has conductive abilities,
storage abilities.

00:17:27.573 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Everything is energy.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It's just moving and vibrating,
and it's all a communication

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.665 align:middle line:84%
This whole system
is, and I'm thrilled

00:17:34.665 --> 00:17:37.350 align:middle line:84%
to hear that you're
working with this directly.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Body Memory Recall-- can you
tell us about what that is,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.045 align:middle line:90%
specifically?

00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:43.920 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Well, yes.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a form of the
body work that really

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:90%
incorporates many techniques.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.870 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, it's
bringing touch to the body

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and specifically to the places
in the body where it's gotten

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.820 align:middle line:90%
hard or restricted or painful.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's inviting a change to
take place in those tissues.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you place your hands
on these areas of the body,

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.170 align:middle line:84%
it not only stimulates the
physical tissues and fluids

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.560 align:middle line:84%
to begin to soften
and release, but it

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:84%
begins to touch and connect with
the person inside the tissues

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:21.390 align:middle line:90%
and the fluids.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:90%
There's a person-- it's us.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:90%
It's our energy.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Our essence is actually embedded
within our tissues and fluids.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.385 align:middle line:84%
And it's that person
that's afraid,

00:18:31.385 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and they're afraid
of things that

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.470 align:middle line:90%
have happened in their past.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And they're storing that in
their fluids and tissues.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So the touch is really very
specific, in that it's gentle,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.560 align:middle line:90%
it's loving, it's connected.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:45.630 align:middle line:90%
It's not imposing or forceful.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And this helps a person
to feel safe, so safe

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.920 align:middle line:84%
that they not only relax, but
they encounter those defense

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
systems that have been
active for many years.

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And it helps them feel safe
enough to let them down.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
you get that transmission

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:84%
of suppressed energy
and that release.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Healing presence
in that safety.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Yes.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Wonderful.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.180 align:middle line:84%
So how did you go
about developing

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:90%
the actual procedure?

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.340 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that
it's a combination

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.570 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of different things.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:84%
But just tell us
about your process.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Sure.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So I started out with my
physical therapy degree,

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.770 align:middle line:84%
and then it was after
physical therapy school

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.130 align:middle line:84%
that I started training
in weekend seminars

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.840 align:middle line:90%
in myofascial release.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Myofascial release
taught by John Barnes

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
has been a significant
component to my work.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And then I trained
in other techniques,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
like craniosacral therapy
and visceral manipulation.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
But all of these techniques
had one thing in common.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
They all interacted with the
body and the connective tissue

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.330 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:84%
But also, they touch
the body in a way

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:51.840 align:middle line:84%
that help people to access
these protective responses

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.230 align:middle line:84%
and release them and get that
body memory component out.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So after training in many
different techniques,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.130 align:middle line:84%
I just thought I would put them
all together into one approach.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.270 align:middle line:84%
My real intention was to
try to bring body memory

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:84%
to as many people as possible
and the healing of body memory

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.230 align:middle line:90%
to as many people as possible.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.400 align:middle line:84%
And I just think all of
those technical terms--

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.740 align:middle line:84%
myofascial release,
craniosacral therapy--

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
they don't mean anything
to the layperson.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
But body memory and body
memory transformation

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.750 align:middle line:84%
is the universal term that
starts to relate to all people.

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's how it developed
over a period of time.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: What do you
think the element is

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.400 align:middle line:90%
that makes it so effective?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.950 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: The key
element is that A,

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:84%
there's intention to help a
person release body memory.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Without that intention, look
how many modalities there

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:90%
are out there.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.210 align:middle line:84%
If you ask all
those practitioners,

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:84%
is your goal to help
release body memory?

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.360 align:middle line:90%
They'd probably say no.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So without the intent, most
of the time it doesn't happen.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.620 align:middle line:84%
So intention and
secondly, education.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.830 align:middle line:84%
If a person comes in
to receive body memory,

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:90%
they've been educated about it.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And they've already prepared
themselves psychologically,

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.740 align:middle line:90%
emotionally.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
They're ready to
receive that healing.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.890 align:middle line:84%
So intention, education,
and the last thing is touch.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:18.420 align:middle line:84%
Your touch, the quality
of your touch-- again,

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.110 align:middle line:84%
connecting with the
person in the body

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:26.330 align:middle line:84%
before manipulating the body
because you can very easily

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:29.330 align:middle line:84%
lose connection with the
person and get overly

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.550 align:middle line:84%
involved with their
muscles and their bones

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and their joints and their
fluids and forget there's

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.180 align:middle line:90%
a person in there.

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And that feels like
a physical workout,

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:39.860 align:middle line:90%
a physical manipulation.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And it can feel
very good, but it

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.420 align:middle line:84%
doesn't help us to get access
to those protective responses.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
So the key is to come
out of protection.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.360 align:middle line:84%
What's going to
help you to do that?

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
To me, nothing
better than touch,

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
a loving touch, a safe touch,
but one that actually connects

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.110 align:middle line:84%
with you inside, because
where we're afraid

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:90%
is where we feel alone.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody connects
with that part of you that's

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.640 align:middle line:84%
alone and afraid
energetically, it

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
has magical effects
of transformation.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And this works for
people that don't even

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.380 align:middle line:84%
remember the trauma,
the original trauma?

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Does it work for things
that would be accessing

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:22.880 align:middle line:84%
a trauma that happened that
someone doesn't necessarily

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.140 align:middle line:90%
have conscious memory of?

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it was so long ago,
they've blocked it out,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.860 align:middle line:90%
or what have you.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
In traumatic
circumstances, oftentimes,

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.110 align:middle line:84%
people disconnect
completely, don't even

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.780 align:middle line:84%
remember that something happened
when they were two or three

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.713 align:middle line:90%
or four or five years old.

00:22:38.713 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Have you had
experience in working

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.170 align:middle line:84%
with people that are
having memories come up,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and they can't
connect it with what

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.020 align:middle line:90%
the trauma was that caused it?

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.820 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Yes.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.070 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people
are connected

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.000 align:middle line:10%
with this present moment and the
symptoms of their body memory.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:10%
They have a physical symptom,
an emotional symptom,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:10%
a psychological symptom,
a stress of some kind.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.160 align:middle line:84%
They might have a
theoretical idea

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this relates to
something from my past, but not

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.960 align:middle line:90%
an exact knowing.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.480 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
is your body knows.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to
figure everything out.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Your body is already
ready to take you

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.010 align:middle line:84%
through that
transformational process.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:20.000 align:middle line:84%
It really just requires
you showing up and saying,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to begin that process
and go through recall, release.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And then integration
is where you

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.290 align:middle line:84%
get insights, memories
of things that maybe you

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.830 align:middle line:90%
had forgotten about.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.450 align:middle line:84%
So all of that comes, and
it's a very natural process.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: What is unwinding?

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.590 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Unwinding
is a term that

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:45.830 align:middle line:84%
describes the release step of
body memory transformation.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is the
body-- once the defenses

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.390 align:middle line:84%
drop and the suppressed
energy moves through the body,

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.790 align:middle line:90%
it moves the body.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So the body will
spontaneously move.

00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.970 align:middle line:90%
You're not moving it.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not moving it.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just moving on its own.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.450 align:middle line:84%
As suppressed energy is
moving through the tissues,

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
moving through all your anatomy,
it's moving your anatomy.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So your body goes into
different positions.

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.430 align:middle line:90%
It shakes.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
Again, spontaneous emotions
come up and are expressed.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people go into
positions of injury or trauma.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:84%
So that's called
positional memory.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:84%
But that whole dynamic
release response

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:90%
is given a term unwinding.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:31.490 align:middle line:84%
It's like we get wound up, and
then when we heal, we unwind.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Excellent.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, for those that might not
really know what the fascia is,

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
it's like the
connect-- can you just

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:42.310 align:middle line:84%
describe-- this
connective tissue that's

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.510 align:middle line:84%
in between the organs in
the muscles and the glands,

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and covering the
internal workings

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
and holding things
together in a sort of way.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Can you just drop into
a little definition

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.452 align:middle line:84%
there to allow-- make
sure all of our viewers

00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:56.660 align:middle line:90%
get what we're talking about?

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.197 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Well,
you said it nicely.

00:24:58.197 --> 00:24:59.780 align:middle line:84%
I went through
physical therapy school

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and still had no concept of
what connective tissue is.

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So just so everybody
knows, this was not

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:84%
standard information in health
classes or biology classes.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.550 align:middle line:84%
This is a system that got
overlooked and got put

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.190 align:middle line:84%
on the sidelines as
not an important tissue

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and is now being elevated
as maybe the most

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.930 align:middle line:90%
important system in the body.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
First of all, connective
tissue is a protein.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.600 align:middle line:84%
It's a chain of proteins
that has a beginning, which

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
is at the top of your
head, and an end, which

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.150 align:middle line:90%
is at the bottom of your feet.

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.320 align:middle line:84%
It's a continuous
network of proteins

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:41.950 align:middle line:84%
that looks like white, stringy,
web-like tissue very randomly

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:90%
organized in the body.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So it has connective functions
and that it connects everything

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.790 align:middle line:90%
to everything--

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:52.030 align:middle line:84%
blood vessels to
bones, bones to organs.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:90%
It connects cells to cells.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.400 align:middle line:90%
It connects everything.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.280 align:middle line:84%
But what's being
discovered now is

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
it not only has
connective functions,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.680 align:middle line:84%
but it has conductive
functions of energy.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And inside connective tissue,
the fibers are hollow,

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.090 align:middle line:90%
and they have fluid inside.

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Strolling Under the Skin
is a fascinating video,

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
the first ever that
begins to show in a living

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.790 align:middle line:84%
body with a small
little telescope what

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:90%
living fascia looks like.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So I recommend you look that
up, Strolling Under the Skin.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see the fluid
moving through these fibers

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:90%
of connective tissue.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the fluid hardens,
when the fibers of connective

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.780 align:middle line:84%
tissue bond together,
that's what's

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.550 align:middle line:84%
creating what's
called body armor.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we feel hard
and tight and even painful

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.360 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.318 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Science is showing
us in energy medicine

00:26:42.318 --> 00:26:45.310 align:middle line:84%
that this is actually a
form of communication that's

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:46.930 align:middle line:84%
running through the
body that operates

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:51.710 align:middle line:84%
as effectively-- in fact, more
instantaneously than the nerve

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.510 align:middle line:90%
impulse.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually carrying
communication as well.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So if that
communication is getting

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.910 align:middle line:84%
thwarted because of
these stored memories,

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:05.620 align:middle line:84%
it keeps us from having a sense
of well-being that is inherent.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.270 align:middle line:84%
This shielding keeps us from
knowing who we really are

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and that we're OK and
that trauma has passed.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.820 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: You're right.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not just helping
us communicate

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.670 align:middle line:84%
with our outer environment but
also our inner environment.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.740 align:middle line:90%
The other--

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.198 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: And if
I could step this

00:27:22.198 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
into another level of
anatomy that isn't often

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.390 align:middle line:84%
standard anatomy in
our school system

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:90%
is our energetic anatomy.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:34.000 align:middle line:84%
We have a light body,
an energy body that

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.070 align:middle line:90%
surrounds the physical body.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And what's being
discovered scientifically

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.860 align:middle line:84%
is this light body
is being channeled

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.250 align:middle line:84%
into the physical body,
into the cells of our body,

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:46.930 align:middle line:90%
pumped into it.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.080 align:middle line:84%
And then the connective
tissue system, specifically,

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.490 align:middle line:84%
is converting the light
into sound and electricity

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and magnetic waves.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's converting it
into forms of energy

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:84%
that our nervous system and the
fluids and circulatory system

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.630 align:middle line:90%
and organs can work with.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.630 align:middle line:84%
So it's interfacing our light
body with our physical body.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So when it gets all
gummed up and hardened,

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:84%
it's depriving us access
and the experience

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.440 align:middle line:84%
of this part of our
nature, which is actually

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:90%
quite powerful and beautiful.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Now you're singing my song.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.830 align:middle line:84%
This is what I absolutely
love, is that there are not

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:24.190 align:middle line:84%
two separate worlds of energy
and then our physicality,

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.570 align:middle line:90%
that there's this bridge.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And science is starting to
study the bridge between,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and this is exactly
what you're speaking of.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.850 align:middle line:90%
Much more to come.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have a video
here of Jonathan

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.560 align:middle line:90%
facilitating and unwinding.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.090 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look and have
Jonathan talk us through it

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.890 align:middle line:90%
as we're watching.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:43.037 align:middle line:90%


00:28:43.037 --> 00:28:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: So as you
can see, the first step

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:48.070 align:middle line:84%
is to connect with the
person in the body.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So as a practitioner, you learn
to touch people and connect

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.350 align:middle line:90%
with that person first.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And you can see the level
of focus and concentration

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:84%
in both myself and my wife
Angie as we work with Peter here

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.230 align:middle line:90%
on the table.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, as Peter begins to
allow himself to receive

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that connection, you
see his body starts

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.930 align:middle line:84%
to come out of protect mode, and
his body now starts to unwind.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It transmits in
little ways, and later

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.830 align:middle line:84%
in big ways, some of
the suppressed energies

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:90%
and stresses that he has held.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.220 align:middle line:90%
And that produces movement.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
And as practitioners,
you learn how

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.280 align:middle line:84%
to feel a person
wanting to unwind

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.970 align:middle line:84%
and how to use your hands
to support that unwinding.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.430 align:middle line:84%
When a person feels
supported to unwind,

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:48.260 align:middle line:84%
it helps them to unwind
deeper and more fully.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people need to push
and exert themselves and push

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.730 align:middle line:84%
against your hands as a way of
getting suppressed energy out.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.113 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.113 --> 00:30:01.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: It's kind of a
rebirthing kind of thing

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.430 align:middle line:84%
that's happening in certain
ways, moving energy into this.

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Yeah.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:10.090 align:middle line:84%
If you appreciate that
all of this tension

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.870 align:middle line:84%
is becoming like a prison,
a straitjacket, a shell,

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.980 align:middle line:84%
that we're internally
feeling very compromised by

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and we want out,
but we're afraid.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:84%
And so once we overcome
the fear of it,

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%
you see exactly what you saw,
which is a person-- almost

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.450 align:middle line:90%
like a snake shedding its skin.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.320 align:middle line:84%
It's writhing its way out of
its hardness and tensions.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And energies are
just moving out.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And the end result is you
feel like you've been birthed.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Oh, here I am.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: You feel lighter
and fresh and alive again.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.295 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, here I am.

00:30:41.295 --> 00:30:43.545 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Now, once someone has
this experience with you,

00:30:43.545 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
can they continue to
do this on their own?

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Once they recognize that,
oh, here's what I have to do,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.020 align:middle line:84%
I have to let go in this way
and allow this thing to happen,

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:84%
they can continue
it on their own?

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.937 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: That's
the takeaway, is

00:30:53.937 --> 00:30:55.840 align:middle line:84%
that when you
remember how to let

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.170 align:middle line:84%
go, because it is a remembering,
once you remember how

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.410 align:middle line:84%
to let go, that's the
positive body memory,

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.420 align:middle line:90%
is you go, oh, yeah.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.640 align:middle line:90%
This actually feels good.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.940 align:middle line:90%
This is really OK.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.730 align:middle line:90%
I can trust this process.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Then when you're in
your everyday life

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.710 align:middle line:84%
and you have stresses
into your life,

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:18.250 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to become
aware of the habit

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.820 align:middle line:84%
to survive and suppress
and just switch gears.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.520 align:middle line:90%
And you can self-unwind at home.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.190 align:middle line:84%
I usually tell people to
do it in a quiet place,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:30.190 align:middle line:84%
private place, on the
floor with pillows,

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:84%
so that their body is free to
move and stretch and release

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and make sounds.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Cry if you need to,
whatever needs to happen,

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that you're uninhibited
in the process.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.540 align:middle line:90%
Light a candle.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Put some music on.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yeah.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.920 align:middle line:84%
What is it that
you would suggest

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.080 align:middle line:84%
that someone do to
be able to cultivate

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.200 align:middle line:90%
their own ability to unwind?

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.315 align:middle line:84%
Are there ways
that they can live?

00:31:52.315 --> 00:31:53.440 align:middle line:90%
Are there lifestyle things?

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.065 align:middle line:84%
Are there things they
can pay attention

00:31:55.065 --> 00:31:58.360 align:middle line:84%
to that are going to enhance
their ability to sense

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.120 align:middle line:84%
and perceive, oh, this
needs to be happening,

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.880 align:middle line:84%
and my body really wants
to just untangle or unwind

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:90%
in this area?

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything that
you can suggest for people

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.580 align:middle line:84%
to begin to cultivate
their ability to do this?

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Yes.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.240 align:middle line:84%
I would say there's
a few things.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:84%
First, consider the
opposite of suppression.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.820 align:middle line:90%
The opposite is expression.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.210 align:middle line:84%
So just getting mindful
of all of your tendencies

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day to suppress
movement, to suppress emotion,

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:32.050 align:middle line:84%
to suppress sound, or suppress
communication or words,

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.950 align:middle line:90%
and simply shift.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:35.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to express.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let my
body move in this way.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.740 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to let some sound out.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.300 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to let myself feel
and express what I'm feeling,

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.130 align:middle line:84%
maybe not in the
moment it's happening

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.960 align:middle line:84%
if it feels inappropriate,
but in a private place.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.760 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: In some way.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.052 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: That's a good start.

00:32:50.052 --> 00:32:52.630 align:middle line:84%
The other is to begin
educating yourself more

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:54.130 align:middle line:90%
about this phenomenon.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend my book,
Freedom from Body Memory,

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.380 align:middle line:84%
only because it
lays the foundation,

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and we need to
understand the experience

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:07.220 align:middle line:84%
before we feel necessarily safe
in entering the experience.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Lastly, there's no substitute
for being in a class or retreat

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:19.425 align:middle line:84%
environment or even having
the BMR body work directly.

00:33:19.425 --> 00:33:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be where I'm
at today in this process

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.860 align:middle line:90%
if I didn't have help.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.660 align:middle line:90%
We need help.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Get over the hump
when you get started.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.797 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: We need
to get over the hump.

00:33:28.797 --> 00:33:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So a three-day
retreat or a class

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.870 align:middle line:84%
will help jump start you into
this experience that's totally

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.540 align:middle line:90%
natural but ultimately foreign.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:39.040 align:middle line:90%
And we just need to remember.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:84%
And then we can
take off on our own.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:84%
There's also physical stretching
you can do with balls and foam

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.530 align:middle line:84%
rollers and other forms
of yoga that can take you

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:55.900 align:middle line:84%
into an unwinding state if you
have remembered how to unwind.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Everyday stretching can
turn into an unwinding

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.250 align:middle line:84%
if you have cultivated
that ability.

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Right.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.080 align:middle line:84%
If you can recognize that
subtle threshold, where

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.510 align:middle line:84%
it goes from being
intentional about something

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.030 align:middle line:84%
and then being
available to something

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:13.139 align:middle line:84%
that's trying to happen
unconsciously through the body.

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:13.989 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.160 align:middle line:84%
So what are some of
the most dramatic--

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.770 align:middle line:84%
the outcomes that
you've witnessed,

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.440 align:middle line:84%
the healings, the processes,
the transformations

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.880 align:middle line:90%
that have occurred with BMR?

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:22.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm putting you on the spot now.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Just give us some examples.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.030 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: The
video that we just

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.300 align:middle line:84%
watched, there was
a lady who said

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.989 align:middle line:84%
she had over 35 broken bones
in her body in a car accident.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And she came to see
me using a cane.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.469 align:middle line:84%
She was also on antidepressants
and many medications

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.590 align:middle line:84%
to help cope with the
amount of pain in her body.

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.790 align:middle line:84%
She had a lot of hardware
to put her back together.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:45.500 align:middle line:90%
She had gone through a divorce.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And so she was also--

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.780 align:middle line:90%
not only had lost her--

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:84%
had that kind of loss
in a relationship,

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:54.560 align:middle line:84%
but then she had this car
accident on top of it.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.995 align:middle line:84%
She was a very active, athletic
person, and now lost her body.

00:34:57.995 --> 00:35:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So it was a pretty sad
state, but somehow she

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.310 align:middle line:84%
found her way to me
for body memory work,

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:06.890 align:middle line:90%
hoping that it could help.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And within a few sessions, her
body unwound, the car accident.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:17.480 align:middle line:84%
It unwound the grief and
heartache from her divorce.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And it helped her to reconnect
with her original essence,

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:90%
her true nature.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.150 align:middle line:84%
And she started to find
her courage, her love,

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.640 align:middle line:90%
her inspiration, and her spirit.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And she left my clinic
after a few sessions

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:35.830 align:middle line:84%
not using a cane and
off her medications.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a few
years since then,

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:90%
but she is thriving in her life.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.140 align:middle line:84%
I still talk with
her occasionally.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.050 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.340 align:middle line:84%
This is what makes-- it
makes it all matter, when

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.930 align:middle line:90%
things like this happen.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: I would say one of
the other dramatic experiences

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.620 align:middle line:84%
is watching a baby
unwind, because babies you

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.510 align:middle line:90%
can't have a conversation with.

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And some babies have been
born, and they're colicky,

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.413 align:middle line:84%
and they're crying, or they seem
to be under a lot of stress.

00:36:02.413 --> 00:36:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And the mother is
really concerned

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.590 align:middle line:90%
and they don't know what to do.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Babies unwind instantly.

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.640 align:middle line:84%
They just haven't
learned not to.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And they somehow just
need the lightest support.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.010 align:middle line:84%
So just the gentlest
of touch to their body.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And their little bodies will
writhe and go into positions,

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and they scream and they cry
and they get red and they shake.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:25.125 align:middle line:90%
And then within minutes--

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's all gone.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: --their body
just melts on the table.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:28.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: It's all OK.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: They look up at mom.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.455 align:middle line:90%
They go to the breast.

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:33.300 align:middle line:90%
They don't have all of that.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.240 align:middle line:84%
All their anxiety
issues are gone.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.450 align:middle line:84%
It's also my experience that we
hold memory from our ancestors.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.910 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes certain
pains and stresses

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.280 align:middle line:84%
are handed down
through our lineage,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.960 align:middle line:90%
and we just inherit them.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And these little babies
have the opportunity

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:55.220 align:middle line:84%
when they're treated to unwind
a lot of these programmings that

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:59.120 align:middle line:84%
are stress and survival and
pain related programming,

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.750 align:middle line:90%
to get it out of their system.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:03.920 align:middle line:84%
So one of my real desires
is to bring this work

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:07.850 align:middle line:84%
to doulas and midwives so we can
help mothers and children clear

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:11.240 align:middle line:84%
trauma so they don't have to
live it out for so many years.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.660 align:middle line:84%
As if our parents hand us
the baton and say, here.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.780 align:middle line:90%
I did what I could do.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:16.210 align:middle line:90%
Good luck.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:16.640 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Exactly.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.265 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: You take it from here.

00:37:17.265 --> 00:37:18.265 align:middle line:90%
That's all I can handle.

00:37:18.265 --> 00:37:19.065 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:37:19.065 --> 00:37:20.150 align:middle line:90%
That's beautiful.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So two of Jonathan's clients
were so affected by BMR,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.770 align:middle line:84%
they're in the process of
producing a documentary

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.570 align:middle line:90%
about it.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:27.674 align:middle line:90%
Here's a trailer.

00:37:27.674 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.900 align:middle line:84%
>> BMR was the first thing that
really got me out of my head.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Within our hearts
is unconditional love.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> BMR has made me a
lot more confident.

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.332 align:middle line:84%
>> What BMR means
to me is freedom.

00:37:43.332 --> 00:37:45.040 align:middle line:10%
>>TRIPODI: One of the
most amazing things

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.640 align:middle line:10%
that comes out of the Body
Memory Recall healing process

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.890 align:middle line:10%
is how much fear
is in our bodies.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the first time I
ever felt that nurturing,

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.480 align:middle line:90%
loving touch.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was unconditional
love that I felt,

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.120 align:middle line:90%
and it gave me hope.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's
beautiful about BMR is,

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:84%
through very loving and
sensitive touch to the body,

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:84%
you get to discover where
fear is residing in your body,

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.480 align:middle line:90%
where you're still afraid.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And that touch helps to
invite us to come out of fear.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:21.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we come out of fear,
we not only release the things

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.590 align:middle line:84%
that we're afraid
of in the past,

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.860 align:middle line:84%
but we start to open up
into the present moment

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and become fearless
in the present moment.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So powerful and so open
to my body and to myself.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: In the release phase,
it's a letting go of control.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It's allowing of
suppressed energy

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:43.480 align:middle line:90%
to transmit through your body.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Just exploding
heart full of love,

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.120 align:middle line:84%
and I felt like I
was truly myself,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.610 align:middle line:84%
that person that
I was so long ago.

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that occurs
with BMR treatments is you stop

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.970 align:middle line:84%
living in ways that
insults your soul.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:02.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It just clicked and changed
the way I started thinking

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.120 align:middle line:90%
about life.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.240 align:middle line:90%
>> It's what love feels like.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.760 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: So in BMR,
it's like bringing touch,

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.030 align:middle line:84%
and it's inviting people
to enter this process

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:16.300 align:middle line:84%
to really restore
wholeness to themselves.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I had my first release,
and I was just totally amazed.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.070 align:middle line:90%
And I was hooked.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> That first BMR treatment,
it was all so much grief around

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:32.680 align:middle line:84%
having to be somebody for
30-plus years that wasn't me.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It was the most
amazing experience.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.060 align:middle line:84%
Whether you're skeptical or
not, you get on the table,

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.770 align:middle line:90%
you're going to feel expansive.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:41.020 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feel free.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: You enter
the present moment,

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:44.275 align:middle line:90%
where anything is possible.

00:39:44.275 --> 00:39:46.562 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:46.562 --> 00:39:49.030 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: We're designed for it.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Another client whose life
has been changed by BMR

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.140 align:middle line:84%
is Jonathan's wife, Angie,
who's joining us here today.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.995 align:middle line:90%
Angie, welcome.

00:39:58.995 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>>ANGIE: Thank you.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.690 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Welcome, welcome.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:02.065 align:middle line:84%
>>ANGIE: Pardon
me, that watching

00:40:02.065 --> 00:40:03.410 align:middle line:90%
that video is emotional.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:07.560 align:middle line:84%
It's still like-- of
course, it's so powerful.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.270 align:middle line:84%
This has really
transformed my life.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:10.070 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.200 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing like
coming home to yourself,

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.900 align:middle line:90%
and that is amazing.

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.050 align:middle line:90%
So how did that happen for you?

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>>ANGIE: Well, I found a
student of Jonathan's had

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:26.850 align:middle line:90%
learned how to do BMR.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:84%
He was an acupuncturist,
and a therapist

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:84%
had recommended
that I go see him.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And so I showed up not
really knowing what BMR was

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.060 align:middle line:90%
all about but ready to say yes.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.520 align:middle line:84%
I was diagnosed with
fibromyalgia when I was 19.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.430 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, I'd had
it for about 12 years.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had tried
everything that there

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.870 align:middle line:84%
was to try to make this pain
better, and to no avail.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:58.330 align:middle line:84%
So I participated
in my first session,

00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.850 align:middle line:90%
and I naturally unwound.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.530 align:middle line:84%
It was completely
unbelievable to me.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So I started going about twice
a week for about three months.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.220 align:middle line:84%
And after that
time, I was healed.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.350 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any more pain.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:16.515 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And what was your
experience inside of that?

00:41:16.515 --> 00:41:18.950 align:middle line:90%
This is just fantastic.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.060 align:middle line:90%
What happened along the way?

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>>ANGIE: Well, I got
access to a lot of things

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that I experienced
in my childhood

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:32.250 align:middle line:84%
that I had not allowed
myself to feel or express

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:35.340 align:middle line:84%
or even acknowledge,
where it had happened,

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.730 align:middle line:84%
as you were asking before, about
those things that you block out

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:41.070 align:middle line:84%
or those things that you might
be afraid of even feeling

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.570 align:middle line:90%
or remembering.

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Those things did come
up in my sessions,

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:middle line:84%
but that was the source
of what was actually

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.800 align:middle line:84%
causing my chronic pain,
was how many times I

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.800 align:middle line:84%
was not only in fight or flight
but the freeze response, which

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.650 align:middle line:84%
is that deer in the
headlights, I am a little kid

00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.300 align:middle line:84%
and I have no
choice in the matter

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.800 align:middle line:90%
and I have nowhere to go.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.712 align:middle line:84%
That started to really store
up and accumulate in my body.

00:42:02.712 --> 00:42:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So when I did those
sessions, I was

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:08.730 align:middle line:84%
able to access those memories
and then feel them and release

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.410 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.950 align:middle line:84%
And then my body was free of
the pain and all of the things

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.340 align:middle line:90%
that were associated with it.

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: And you got more
out of the situation, too.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.630 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>>ANGIE: Yeah.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.155 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: Not just
relief, but you know--

00:42:24.155 --> 00:42:24.955 align:middle line:90%
>>ANGIE: Yes.

00:42:24.955 --> 00:42:26.622 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: You got a life
partner out of it.

00:42:26.622 --> 00:42:28.990 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: Your life partner
comes in mysterious ways.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:30.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Yes, right, in many ways.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.040 align:middle line:90%
We find our destiny.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.560 align:middle line:84%
Are you training others
to do this work as well?

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: I have four
levels of training,

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and then I have additional
unwinding courses

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.870 align:middle line:90%
if people want to pursue it.

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.140 align:middle line:90%
I have a certification program.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.017 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:42:43.017 --> 00:42:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>>SUE: How can people
learn more about that?

00:42:44.850 --> 00:42:48.261 align:middle line:10%
>>TRIPODI: My website,
freedomfrombodymemory.com

00:42:48.261 --> 00:42:51.170 align:middle line:10%
and my book, Freedom
from Body Memory,

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.120 align:middle line:10%
which is available on Amazon.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:53.990 align:middle line:10%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.190 align:middle line:10%
And what do you feel is the most
important piece about this work

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.690 align:middle line:10%
for the world?

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>>TRIPODI: As we
begin to operate

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.280 align:middle line:84%
more from our true nature
and less from our suffering,

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.930 align:middle line:84%
the world changes and it
becomes a better place.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of what this
world is suffering from

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:84%
is billions and
billions of people

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.510 align:middle line:84%
who are suffering, and
holding their suffering,

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and recycling their
suffering, and not knowing

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:23.640 align:middle line:84%
what to do about it, and
feeling helpless around that.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
techniques, but unwinding,

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.420 align:middle line:84%
the one that's built
into you already,

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.190 align:middle line:90%
the part of you that's ready--

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:35.120 align:middle line:84%
any moment you are ready to
allow it to work through you,

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.980 align:middle line:90%
is ready to transform you.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And that's exciting.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SUE: Beautiful.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Thank you both for being
here, and thank you

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
so much, Jonathan, for sharing
your profound insights with us.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.740 align:middle line:84%
The world is ready to
wake up and to learn

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:49.860 align:middle line:90%
how to heal themselves.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:53.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is a wonderful modality
for them to get a great start.

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for being here.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.525 align:middle line:90%
>>TRIPODI: Thank you.

00:43:55.525 --> 00:43:56.357 align:middle line:90%
>>ANGIE: Thank you.

00:43:56.357 --> 00:43:58.190 align:middle line:84%

Recall is an invaluable tool,

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.280 align:middle line:10%
not only to identify the

that which is keeping
us from true well-being.
