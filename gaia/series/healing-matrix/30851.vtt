00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA MEREDITH: One of the
saddest things in my experience

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.410 align:middle line:84%
is that viable, non-toxic
therapies for cancer and other

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.294 align:middle line:84%
diseases have existed
for over 100 years.

00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And yet every one
of them has been

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.390 align:middle line:84%
removed from the menu
in favor of dangerous,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.630 align:middle line:90%
toxic, and expensive therapies.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Those who have struggled to
keep alternative, or real and

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.540 align:middle line:84%
natural, therapies
alive often suffer

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.840 align:middle line:84%
at the hands of the
legal arm of the AMA.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
This has been going on
for a very long time.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.110 align:middle line:10%
Steven Ross, founder of the
World Research Foundation,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.040 align:middle line:10%
has documents and manuscripts
on natural remedies dating

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.980 align:middle line:10%
all the way back to
the 15th century,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.020 align:middle line:10%
including mysterious alchemical
remedies only now making

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:10%
a comeback.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And Steven, it's wonderful
to have you on again.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> STEVEN ROSS: Thank
you very much, Regina.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: We've had a few
shows together and they're just

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.999 align:middle line:90%
a delight every time.

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.790 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Thank you.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And the last time,
we talked about the world

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:10%
of microscopes and Rife and the
Nemoscope and the fact that we

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:10%
have the ability to look at life
down to the atomic energetic

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.490 align:middle line:10%
level, but we've been restricted
from access to that information

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:10%
because those
people were killed,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.529 align:middle line:10%
and their technologies
were basically squashed.

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:41.070 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.060 align:middle line:10%
And we find that over and over.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.390 align:middle line:10%
Part of the reason
why I co-founded

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:10%
World Research with Laverne
Bachmann, an associate,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:10%
was that we wanted to keep
a preservation, a record

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.050 align:middle line:10%
of these type of
things because it just

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.510 align:middle line:10%
seems that we are so
enamored in society

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:10%
today with our newest discovery,
our newest invention-- this

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.900 align:middle line:10%
makes us so evolved and ahead
of everything in the past.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:10%
And yet, as you start
looking back in the past,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.040 align:middle line:10%
you start realizing that
they were also very wise.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.190 align:middle line:10%
There were individuals,
men and women,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:10%
who had wonderful discoveries
and, really, tools

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.880 align:middle line:10%
that would help us
in today's world

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.420 align:middle line:10%
and we bypassed and
overlooked them.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:10%
It would be nice to
say it only happened

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:10%
because time forgot them.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:10%
But as we will find in this
segment, this show with you,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.970 align:middle line:10%
there's a little bit more
than them just disappearing.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:10%
It's that they have
been, a lot of them,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.394 align:middle line:10%
obliterated, removed, forced
underground, or disappeared.

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Absolutely.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.572 align:middle line:84%
And why don't we
start, since we have

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:56.030 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people to get through,
and I want you to really go

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
into some detail explaining the
technologies they were working

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.834 align:middle line:84%
with, their success
rates, and then

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:02.250 align:middle line:84%
what happened to
each one of them.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.708 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the
formula we'll be

00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:84%
looking at here
that I'd like to do.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's start going
back into the early 1500s

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.280 align:middle line:90%
with Paracelsus.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.460 align:middle line:84%
Explain who he was in the
day, because this was still

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
is regarded as one of the
most profound thinkers

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.920 align:middle line:90%
in the world of medicine.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:17.630 align:middle line:90%
Ever.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Right.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:10%
Paracelsus had about five
elements to his name.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:10%
So it correctly was Theophrastus
Bombastus von Hohenheim

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:10%
Paracelsus.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.862 align:middle line:10%
So it's easier just
to say Paracelsus.

00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, Paracelsus--

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.445 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Bombastus.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Bombastus.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.400 align:middle line:10%
He rocked a lot of boats,
but, basically, this

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:10%
is how he operated.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:10%
He tells the story of how,
when he was a young boy,

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.000 align:middle line:10%
the dog that was part of
their family was very ill.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:10%
Now his father and mother were
both in the medical field,

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.710 align:middle line:10%
but they didn't address
the dog's problem.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.160 align:middle line:10%
They were having a
party and Paracelsus

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:03.100 align:middle line:10%
noticed that the dog, who was
sickly, walked out of the house

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.290 align:middle line:10%
into the forest.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.421 align:middle line:10%
So Paracelsus
decided, all right,

00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm not going to
be with the adults.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:10%
He follows the dog
into the forest.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.240 align:middle line:10%
The dog passes different plants,
flowers; sniffs; keeps going.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:10%
Eventually comes to an herb
and started chewing it,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:10%
laid down, and 30
minutes later sprang up,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.010 align:middle line:10%
and the problem was rectified.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:10%
Now Paracelsus at the time was
probably 10 years old, 7 to 10,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:10%
and he thought why is it that an
animal could figure out what it

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:10%
needed and human beings can't.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, for the animal it's
instinct, but for us humans,

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.320 align:middle line:10%
it is intuition.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.076 align:middle line:84%
And Paracelsus was
a very firm believer

00:04:57.076 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
of observing and watching and
becoming one with the elements.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.190 align:middle line:84%
His famous saying
was: the way to learn

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.630 align:middle line:90%
nature is to walk her leaves.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you sit humbly
in front of a plant

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
or any sort of element,
and they will speak to you.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:10%
It will transmit its
awareness and knowledge.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.870 align:middle line:10%
So here we have Paracelsus
with that part of nature.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.920 align:middle line:10%
But now he met
several alchemists,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.550 align:middle line:10%
as they were termed,
who were teaching him

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.540 align:middle line:10%
the more deeper aspects of life.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, while alchemist are known
for running around, turning

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
everything into--
base metals into gold,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.880 align:middle line:84%
some were doing that, but it
was a spiritual philosophy

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:84%
of rising to a
higher consciousness.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.970 align:middle line:84%
But it just so happens
that Paracelsus

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.640 align:middle line:84%
was one of the ones who could
turn base metals into gold.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
His discoveries, his ability
to go anywhere in the world

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.300 align:middle line:84%
to talk with witches, to talk
with and learn wives' tales.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:84%
He went to the Fuguers,
the mining family,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
and learned that
gold and silver veins

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.144 align:middle line:90%
expanded after about 100 years.

00:06:14.144 --> 00:06:16.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: You mean after
they had been mined?

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: They had been mined,
and they stopped mining.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.460 align:middle line:10%
And they said to him,
these veins extended.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.900 align:middle line:10%
They grew.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.630 align:middle line:10%
They were alive.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.020 align:middle line:10%
And he realized that
everything is alive.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is around,
again, 1512, 1515.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:10%
He was really a rebel.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.720 align:middle line:10%
As we mentioned in
a previous show,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.740 align:middle line:10%
he asked the
apothecaries, he demanded,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.900 align:middle line:10%
we want to know what's
in your concoctions.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.860 align:middle line:84%
And you're killing people, so
you really should change it.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
He was run out of
town after town.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.330 align:middle line:84%
As he went into a new
town, he said tell me

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:90%
the worst cases you have.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Elephantiasis, cancer, he
cured every one of them

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
in the 1500's, because
here's what he believed.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:90%
Nothing in nature is wasted.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.200 align:middle line:10%
Even a disease or illness
which is dangerous to you

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.900 align:middle line:10%
and I or any human
might be something

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.690 align:middle line:10%
that is food for some other
organism in this planet.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.340 align:middle line:10%
And so he made concoctions that
he laid on his patients' skins

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.260 align:middle line:10%
absorbing whatever this energy
problem was, bringing it over

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:10%
to some other part in nature,
and that other part absorbed it

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.780 align:middle line:10%
because it was a nutrient.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.720 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Whoa.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.150 align:middle line:10%
Now that's alchemy.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: This is alchemy.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:10%
This man really was
so brilliant that many

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.710 align:middle line:10%
of the great intellects
in medicine said,

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.330 align:middle line:10%
if it wasn't for Paracelsus, I
wouldn't have got to the stage

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.650 align:middle line:10%
that I was at, I wouldn't
have had my understanding.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:10%
So even though he
was from the Middle

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:05.110 align:middle line:10%
Ages and the unscientific,
he was very scientific.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:10%
He kept records.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.235 align:middle line:10%
He grew his herbs under
different astrological signs.

00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Kind of like the
biodynamic way of-- but plus.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: And wave.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:90%
He was using magnets.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.670 align:middle line:84%
He was doing homeopathy 200
years before Hahnemann even

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:90%
did it.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
He was doing mesmerism
before Mesmer was credited.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.600 align:middle line:84%
He was doing all of these
things hundreds of years

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.150 align:middle line:90%
before others.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:10%
What got him into
trouble, of course,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.960 align:middle line:10%
was that he said, we've got
a lot of pompous sphincters

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.760 align:middle line:10%
around, and these people will
not let anything new come in

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.450 align:middle line:10%
because they must
preserve their theories,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:10%
because they are
regarded as the experts.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:58.000 align:middle line:10%
And he, again, went to everybody
to learn what they believed

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:10%
was the truth, and
he incorporated it

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.020 align:middle line:10%
into his healing systems.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now,
some of his work,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.850 align:middle line:90%
some of his journals survived.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, did some of his work go
through burnings and so forth?

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.640 align:middle line:90%
Or were they exempt from that?

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.940 align:middle line:90%
Were they hidden away?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: He did
not write, himself.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.750 align:middle line:84%
He had several people who
were very close to him.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.570 align:middle line:90%
One was named Oswald Crowley.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.589 align:middle line:10%
And they really took
notes and wrote down what

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:10%
the great teacher--

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.780 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: They wrote
everything for him.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.405 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Right.

00:09:29.405 --> 00:09:33.400 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of that came
out in the late 1500s.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at World
Research Foundation,

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:40.860 align:middle line:84%
we have the complete collected
works of Paracelsus from 1590,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.200 align:middle line:84%
where that was pretty
close to his time period.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And more than likely, most
of those-- unfortunately,

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
it's in Low German, which
is very difficult to read.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.570 align:middle line:90%
But at least it's preserved.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Here was an individual who
said you cannot be a physician

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.040 align:middle line:84%
if you really don't
understand the body or nature.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And a good physician
is a humble person

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.890 align:middle line:84%
who will learn from
everybody, and that person

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.920 align:middle line:84%
will be a successful
medical practitioner.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So I like going back to him
and using him as a baseline,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.690 align:middle line:84%
because the difference
in our system

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.670 align:middle line:84%
nowadays is, anybody with a
new invention to discovery

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
is put down because of
the vested interests.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.810 align:middle line:84%
In his day, new discoveries
come because you're right there,

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.060 align:middle line:84%
and you must come up with a
solution in those old days.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.490 align:middle line:90%
So they came up with solutions.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.840 align:middle line:84%
They made incredible
discoveries.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.400 align:middle line:84%
This country was
great in the old days

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.530 align:middle line:84%
when there was a freedom of
expression and invention.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately
it doesn't exist.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.324 align:middle line:90%
Does not exist now.

00:10:56.324 --> 00:10:58.490 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And my understanding
is that some of that

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:84%
information-- you
have these manuals--

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.190 align:middle line:84%
but some of this information
has survived here and there.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are other
people, players coming up

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
on the scene, that
are trying to go back

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
to the way he formulated and
potentized his herbs to really

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.190 align:middle line:84%
do something that can go up
against the pharmaceutical

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.770 align:middle line:84%
industry that is
completely nature-based.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And I like using the
term, "the Pepsi Challenge."

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not pushing either
one of those companies.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:30.460 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is-- and I'm a
former athlete-- head to head,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.410 align:middle line:84%
fair, open tests
and examinations.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.510 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to do
double-- different studies,

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.240 align:middle line:90%
let's make them fair.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.150 align:middle line:84%
And I will explain
why they are not

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.520 align:middle line:90%
fair with some of our people.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
The idea is-- I
always hear this.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Give us more money
and the answer

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.970 align:middle line:90%
is right around the corner.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:84%
And I always say, excuse me,
we already have the answer.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't need more money to
find something that's already

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:84%
been known, and in his
case, 500 years ago.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.200 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well we've fallen
from that nice high plum line.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.856 align:middle line:84%
Now you go into your HMO,
you have something wrong,

00:12:08.856 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:84%
they'll see you
for seven minutes

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and you get whatever the
drug rep and corporation says

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.830 align:middle line:84%
will be the preferred
prescription right now.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:18.750 align:middle line:90%
That's sad.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.810 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: It is sad.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.417 align:middle line:10%
I remember, not too long
ago, reading a study

00:12:23.417 --> 00:12:25.750 align:middle line:10%
that I believe was in a New
England Medical Journal that

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:10%
said that when you go
to your medical doctor,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.090 align:middle line:10%
the doctor will already
start prescribing within 15

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.400 align:middle line:10%
seconds of when
you start talking,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.380 align:middle line:10%
versus a homeopathic
practitioner who

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.590 align:middle line:10%
may ask you questions for
30 minutes or an hour.

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.160 align:middle line:10%
And then they'll start
looking at what's presented.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.690 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Well I know that you
have very little appreciation

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.450 align:middle line:10%
for that kind of behavior, and
I'm going to digress for just

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:52.190 align:middle line:10%
a moment.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:90%
I want to read your disclaimer.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the
official disclaimer,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.470 align:middle line:84%
which probably was something
like, this book is not

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.950 align:middle line:84%
intended as any medical
advice, or something.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, here's the extension
of his disclaimer in his book.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.802 align:middle line:84%
And the name of the book is,
And Nothing Happened, right?

00:13:08.802 --> 00:13:10.635 align:middle line:84%
This is the second
part-- "apparently, there

00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:14.180 align:middle line:84%
is no problem for you to take
the pharmaceutical products

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.930 align:middle line:84%
that are recommended to you
through the advertising media.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Remember, some of their
side effects are minimal.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:84%
That might include heart
attack, stroke, coma,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
or other minor problems,
such as personality changes

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.160 align:middle line:90%
and a desire to commit suicide.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Please read product
labels carefully,

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
and remember that you should
consult the Physician's Desk

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.950 align:middle line:84%
Reference to learn of the other
adverse effects not listed

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.580 align:middle line:84%
on the bottle, for
possible problems

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:84%
your medical specialist
has not warned you about."

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.105 align:middle line:90%
Well, I love it.

00:13:43.105 --> 00:13:44.370 align:middle line:90%
I love that you'll do that.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, the whole
idea is aren't we looking

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.260 align:middle line:90%
for a solution to the problem?

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.216 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.216 --> 00:13:55.350 align:middle line:84%
It has been passed
on that Hippocrates

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.750 align:middle line:90%
said, "First, do no harm."

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.120 align:middle line:84%
There is some discussion whether
or not he really said that.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.270 align:middle line:84%
But let's say somebody said
that-- "First, do no harm."

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
We have completely lost
that whole concept.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not going to blame
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm blaming all your listeners.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.065 align:middle line:84%
Because if we are putting up
with what we are hearing--

00:14:19.065 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: A substandard--
worse than substandard.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.340 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: We are dumbed down
to the point where we are

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.460 align:middle line:84%
accepting-- for people who
are having psychological

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.510 align:middle line:84%
difficulties, the adverse
effect is you may become more

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:33.600 align:middle line:90%
suicidal.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:84%
You may have
personality-- and oh,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.780 align:middle line:84%
by the way, if you notice
a personality disorder,

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:90%
tell your physician.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
I've got a feeling that you
don't have that awareness

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:90%
to tell the physician.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.803 align:middle line:10%
It's laughable, it's ludicrous.

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:49.385 align:middle line:10%


00:14:49.385 --> 00:14:52.810 align:middle line:10%
For women's contraception,
I heard on the other day,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.010 align:middle line:10%
the word "fatal."

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.080 align:middle line:10%
There's heart attacks.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:10%
For psoriasis you're
going to have problems.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.720 align:middle line:90%
This is not medicine.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to go head
to head against some

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.400 align:middle line:90%
of these pharmaceutical.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.530 align:middle line:84%
If any of the other
stations would have the guts

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and ask these people,
what do you consider this?

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:90%
You are poisoning people.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.890 align:middle line:84%
You are giving them
more adverse effects.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I forgot.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Then you have another drug
for that other adverse effect.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.690 align:middle line:84%
I have had people come
into World Research

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:90%
Foundation on eight medications.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.530 align:middle line:84%
And the sixth medication,
its adverse effect

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.890 align:middle line:84%
is why they took their first
medication to begin with.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:41.270 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking at-- that's
all the bashing that I really

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.172 align:middle line:10%
want to do.

00:15:42.172 --> 00:15:44.380 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You know, we did
this a little bit before,

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.986 align:middle line:10%
and I think a lot of people
watching are on the same page.

00:15:47.986 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:90%
We're in agreement on that.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.693 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's go
through historically,

00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:53.730 align:middle line:84%
because, first of all,
after Paracelsus we're

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
going to come up into
the 20th century.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little bit of
the late 19th century,

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:03.000 align:middle line:84%
but we're looking at things
that now are commonly understood

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.800 align:middle line:84%
and even those, even the simple
things like Doctor Semmelweis

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.560 align:middle line:84%
was in the day having
trouble and fighting

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.320 align:middle line:90%
with the people in the AMA.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.422 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
something as simple as what

00:16:14.422 --> 00:16:16.130 align:middle line:84%
he tried to bring
forward, and then we're

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:18.460 align:middle line:84%
going to go into some more
sophisticated technology.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Sounds good.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:84%
We look at Semmelweis and
he was working in hospitals

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:84%
and noticing-- it wasn't
just him noticing--

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.180 align:middle line:84%
the pregnant women who
were delivering were dying.

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:37.150 align:middle line:84%
The percentage of women
dying was extremely high

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.730 align:middle line:90%
in their area in France.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.030 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to figure
out why, and then he

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:47.410 align:middle line:84%
noticed that the doctors
doing the deliveries

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:51.790 align:middle line:84%
were going from one patient
to another doing deliveries

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.750 align:middle line:84%
and-- here's the big one--
never washing their hands.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.832 align:middle line:90%
So he noticed this.

00:16:57.832 --> 00:17:01.860 align:middle line:84%
He instituted this in his
section of the hospital.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:07.319 align:middle line:84%
And the death rate
plummeted to such an extent.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:09.260 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it was incredible.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
It might've been
something like 40% to 1%.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And he tried to
get it instituted

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:19.349 align:middle line:84%
into the other parts of the
hospital, and the doctors said,

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:90%
no we're not going to do that.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.069 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And this is the
recommendation one washed

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.980 align:middle line:90%
their hands between procedures?

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Exactly.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:90%
And they would not do it.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.170 align:middle line:90%
They didn't accept it.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And they did such ridiculous
things to this person.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:84%
He was actually committed
and died in an institution.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.150 align:middle line:90%
That is the sad plight--

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: He was committed
because of this particular

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:90%
practice?

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.140 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: He went crazy.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.830 align:middle line:10%
Because if you see
something that works,

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.910 align:middle line:10%
and nobody is giving
you the time of day,

00:17:54.910 --> 00:18:00.840 align:middle line:10%
and you're talking about human
life-- our show today, the show

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:10%
we did before,
it's about people.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.610 align:middle line:10%
This is what it is.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
It isn't just about these
companies making money.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.747 align:middle line:90%
It isn't about the greed.

00:18:09.747 --> 00:18:11.080 align:middle line:90%
You know what it's really about?

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.940 align:middle line:90%
People.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the health of people.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.040 align:middle line:90%
I would cry over that.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.250 align:middle line:84%
That's what makes
all these things sad.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.985 align:middle line:84%
Somebody once said, Steve what
do you think, and you know,

00:18:21.985 --> 00:18:25.890 align:middle line:84%
all these controversies
and stifling?

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.750 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm more concerned about people.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle line:84%
We're people, and we're
not being treated well.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.900 align:middle line:84%
He ends up in an
asylum and dying.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And then of course,
later, washing the hands

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:39.670 align:middle line:90%
is instituted.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But this was the plight of
Semmelweis in, basically,

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.690 align:middle line:84%
I believe, around
the 1840s, 1850s.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's a long time ago,
but it's not that long ago.

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.380 align:middle line:84%
By the way, I want to
go back to Paracelsus.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.210 align:middle line:84%
In his day, there were
two edicts of law.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.077 align:middle line:84%
One, you could not take a
bath more than once a year.

00:18:59.077 --> 00:18:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Number two, you do not
open your windows at night

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.140 align:middle line:84%
because the plague or
something might come in.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: The evil
humors might come in.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Exactly.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.724 align:middle line:90%
That was the law.

00:19:10.724 --> 00:19:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Was it seriously?

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.431 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:19:12.431 --> 00:19:15.020 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: How did
people ever mate?

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.010 align:middle line:10%
Can you imagine?

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: I know.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.480 align:middle line:10%
So why he changed
or why he came up

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:10%
with something unique with
opening the windows was,

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:27.410 align:middle line:10%
there was a man who was
found dead in a cabin.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:90%
All the windows were closed.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The man hadn't come
out for a couple days.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And when they went in,
they found him dead.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's trying
to figure out, well,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.720 align:middle line:90%
why did this person die?

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
Until Paracelsus
reasoned, it's the air.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
We know we have air, but
there's something in the air.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.820 align:middle line:90%
That's called observation.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.230 align:middle line:84%
That is called making
new discoveries

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.490 align:middle line:84%
right at the point where
you need to make them.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm highlighting
and making a point

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.310 align:middle line:84%
here because we don't
do that anymore.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.295 align:middle line:84%
We are given a drug
and a medication

00:20:02.295 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and that's supposed to be it.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's never tailor-made
for the person anymore.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.890 align:middle line:84%
It's like, OK,
you've been defined

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.800 align:middle line:90%
as this particular problem.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:90%
We've got this solution-- boom.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:90%
And if you make it, fine.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't,
we'll experiment.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.550 align:middle line:10%
We'll give you another one,
where basically a practitioner

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.290 align:middle line:10%
will just follow
these guidelines.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.420 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Meaning
they're practicing on you.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: They are.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.460 align:middle line:84%
So that was Semmelweis and
he brought us up really

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:90%
to the mid-1800s.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Into the
more modern-- OK,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.120 align:middle line:84%
give us an idea of what
was happening at that time.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.860 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of discovery
in the world happening

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:42.970 align:middle line:84%
in the late 1800s
on other levels.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.810 align:middle line:84%
What was going on in
the world of medicine?

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Because this was huge--
archaeological discoveries,

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.282 align:middle line:84%
medical discoveries,
a lot going on.

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:84%
So what was happening
at that time?

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, I would say that
the biggest that I've noticed

00:20:55.220 --> 00:21:03.400 align:middle line:84%
as a librarian and having access
to this is electricity was

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:90%
really coming into vogue.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.120 align:middle line:84%
There were individuals
who were finding,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.990 align:middle line:84%
geez, these electric currents
that we can generate have

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.280 align:middle line:84%
very profound
effects on the body.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:17.000 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, we had
Antoine Mesmer coming up

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and Coue-- "Every
day, in every way,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling better and better."

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:27.000 align:middle line:84%
So we had the mental and
we had the electrical.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.860 align:middle line:84%
At the same time
there was homeopathy,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.140 align:middle line:84%
but when the AMA was
formed-- the American Medical

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Association-- they
formed a union.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.200 align:middle line:84%
They petitioned
the US government.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:84%
That's when this
lobbying started.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.520 align:middle line:84%
And they had the homeopaths
basically banned.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And they went over to
England and to Europe.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:84%
So that the homeopathy
effectively was put out.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.060 align:middle line:84%
But the electricity was
something new and exciting.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:90%
We had our Nikola Tesla.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:90%
We had Thomas Edison.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:84%
They had brought this
to the forefront.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And people started
to experiment.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.130 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Some people
were getting sick initially

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.500 align:middle line:84%
because they had never been
around the density of those

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.090 align:middle line:90%
frequencies.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:84%
They were used to background
types of radiation and such.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.946 align:middle line:84%
So some people were
getting sick from it.

00:22:21.946 --> 00:22:23.320 align:middle line:84%
But let's talk
about the ones who

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.870 align:middle line:84%
were harnessing
and experimenting

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:90%
with it for healing.

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:33.440 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, I believe, again,
in the late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.460 align:middle line:84%
we had the individuals who
recognized that there is

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.020 align:middle line:90%
an electrical aspect to life.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And as we went into
1915, 1920, we started

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.180 align:middle line:84%
getting people such as
Harold Saxton Burr at Yale

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:56.990 align:middle line:84%
University discovering
something called L-fields.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:58.560 align:middle line:10%
Now, what is the L-field?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.670 align:middle line:10%
He reasoned, why is it, Regina,
that your cells are changing--

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:10%
no, there's nothing
the matter there.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.680 align:middle line:10%
Your cells are
changing in your body--

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.740 align:middle line:10%
what keeps your form together?

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.560 align:middle line:10%
What is keeping your form
or my form or anybody's form

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.260 align:middle line:10%
together when these
cells and everything is

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.500 align:middle line:10%
renewing in the body?

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are
electrical fields

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.770 align:middle line:90%
that hold everything in place.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of what it is,
those L-fields are there.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.830 align:middle line:10%
So as he starts experimenting,
Harold Saxton Burr,

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle line:10%
he discovers that there's
different gradients.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:10%
This field has
electrical potential

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.890 align:middle line:10%
he could measure on a voltmeter.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:10%
But he started
noticing, when healing

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.840 align:middle line:10%
was taking place, or
cancer, that there

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.880 align:middle line:10%
was a change in the
electrical field.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:90%
And he's going, whoa.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: How was he
able to observe that?

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, that's
a very good question.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.410 align:middle line:84%
He had the physics
department at Yale University

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
build a device that allowed them
to measure these frequencies

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.370 align:middle line:90%
and voltage in millivolts.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, I don't know, they
did a lot of experiments

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:90%
starting with mice and rats.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.780 align:middle line:90%
And here's what he found.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
now, '20s, '30s.

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.380 align:middle line:84%
He found that weeks
before a tumor

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
would even show up or be there,
the change in electrical field

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.750 align:middle line:84%
was there, and they could
pinpoint exactly where a cancer

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:43.000 align:middle line:84%
tumor was going to show up
on the body of these animals

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.250 align:middle line:84%
and human beings weeks before
the tumor itself was there.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.160 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Now, what is it that
causes the disturbance or shift

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:10%
in that electrical environment?

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.100 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Well it could be--
and there's a lot of people who

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:03.240 align:middle line:10%
still don't get it with
the mind-- your thoughts,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:10%
your mind, they're frequencies.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Environment can have
a lot to do with it.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.510 align:middle line:90%
The food that you eat.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.030 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Any number of things
can change the electrical field

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.040 align:middle line:84%
of a given area in the body--
and who knows what, where,

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:84%
why it uses a particular
area in the body,

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.230 align:middle line:84%
or that area becomes
weak, but it does.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have this change
in the electrical charge,

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
they were able to notice
it, and then was there

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.820 align:middle line:84%
any way they were working with
frequencies to then eradicate

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.320 align:middle line:90%
it?

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.450 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: No, because
at that time,

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:37.420 align:middle line:84%
they really didn't go as far or
think about something that Rife

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.300 align:middle line:84%
was doing, or
later, Nortonstrom.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.152 align:middle line:84%
However, they were hinting
at this frequency bath

00:25:44.152 --> 00:25:45.110 align:middle line:90%
that you had mentioned.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: In the last show,
Patrick Flanagan, to this day,

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.730 align:middle line:84%
still takes these
electricity baths every day.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Because these L-fields
are so profound that they could

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.050 align:middle line:84%
tell when a lump or a
cancer-- believe it or not,

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.970 align:middle line:90%
plants get cancer.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:03.720 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Plants?

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.270 align:middle line:10%
There are plants, they can
have cancerous tumor types.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:10%
Any animal, any
living organism, they

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:17.120 align:middle line:10%
were able to map out the
L-fields of the form.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.360 align:middle line:10%
And they knew when these
frequencies changed,

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:10%
there was like a
dent in the form.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.350 align:middle line:10%
And there was going
to be a problem there.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:10%
I believe if they
had continued-- now

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.090 align:middle line:10%
why didn't they continue?

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Because grant
money was not going

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.810 align:middle line:84%
into the electrical and the
magnetic, it was going into,

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.635 align:middle line:84%
we've got to get a
chemical approach.

00:26:39.635 --> 00:26:41.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do a
chemical approach--

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.645 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, and weren't
the Rockefellers really big

00:26:43.645 --> 00:26:44.145 align:middle line:90%
in the--?

00:26:44.145 --> 00:26:45.330 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, they
had pharmaceutical,

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.380 align:middle line:90%
they had oil interests.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.610 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And yet they only
used homeopathy personally,

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.120 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.946 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: That happens
a lot, doesn't it?

00:26:50.946 --> 00:26:53.070 align:middle line:84%
I'll take one thing, but
I'll give the other people

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.730 align:middle line:90%
something else.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.935 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: As I recall,
they didn't use it.

00:26:57.935 --> 00:27:00.231 align:middle line:84%
I think it was John
D. Rockefeller who

00:27:00.231 --> 00:27:02.480 align:middle line:84%
inspired a lot of this in
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.960 align:middle line:84%
supported it, helped it
grow, didn't even take

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.800 align:middle line:84%
any pharmaceuticals
his entire life.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.330 align:middle line:90%
He used homeopathy and foods.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: It became a
bigger and bigger business.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:16.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure at the time
they didn't believe

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:17.690 align:middle line:90%
that it would be so big.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:22.370 align:middle line:84%
However, there was a
plan set up to eliminate

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:23.920 align:middle line:90%
all of these other practices.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, they couldn't
excuse the expression,

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:90%
blow out Harold Saxton Burr.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.620 align:middle line:90%
He was too big.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.040 align:middle line:84%
But what happens is, you
just don't give 'em money.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:84%
You make sure that
their research--

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.000 align:middle line:90%
One other factor.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.370 align:middle line:84%
He also worked
with an individual,

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I believe it was
Doctor Levitz, they

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:84%
mapped out
psychological problems

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.660 align:middle line:84%
in the Yale
psychiatric department.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of the different
emotional states

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.720 align:middle line:84%
also had specific
electrical frequencies

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.770 align:middle line:90%
for that person's problem.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking
about the ability

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.910 align:middle line:84%
to really see what's going
on with an individual

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.780 align:middle line:90%
before it even might manifest.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So that was Harold Saxton
Burr at Yale University.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.310 align:middle line:10%
Now, I want to jump ahead a
little bit because he ties in

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:23.629 align:middle line:10%
perfectly with Bjorn
Nordenstrom of Sweden.

00:28:23.629 --> 00:28:24.420 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Perfect.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.270 align:middle line:10%
Please do.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.310 align:middle line:10%
I was going to ask
you that, so perfect.

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:36.950 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Here is the cover of
Discover magazine April 1986.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.200 align:middle line:10%
And Discover magazine
said, "Has he

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.380 align:middle line:10%
come up with the biomedical
discovery of the century?

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:10%
All the electrical fields
that are in the body."

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:52.020 align:middle line:10%
So we got so excited
at World Research,

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:56.740 align:middle line:10%
we decided to why Dr.
Nordenstrom out to Los Angeles

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:01.110 align:middle line:10%
to make a presentation in
front of 2000 medical doctors.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.075 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Nordenstrom--

00:29:02.075 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Where was
he coming in from?

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.860 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: He was coming in from
Karolinska Institute in Sweden.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.830 align:middle line:10%
And he was the chairman
of the Nobel Assembly

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.510 align:middle line:10%
that selects the Nobel
laureates in medicine.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:22.840 align:middle line:10%
Discoverer of needle biopsy,
top radiologist in the world.

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:10%
He discovers that
everything that

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.520 align:middle line:10%
goes on with healing
or tumors in the body

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:10%
have to do with electrical
changes in the body.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.990 align:middle line:10%
So he comes up, he starts
working with his patients,

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:45.290 align:middle line:10%
and he discovers that when
a cancer tumor is growing,

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:50.169 align:middle line:10%
the positive charge increases
at the site of the tumor.

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:50.710 align:middle line:10%
White cells--

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.126 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Similar
to Burr's work.

00:29:52.126 --> 00:29:57.370 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Exactly, and white
cells have basically a negative

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.540 align:middle line:10%
potential charge.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.091 align:middle line:10%
So when you've got a problem,
normally the white cells

00:30:03.091 --> 00:30:03.590 align:middle line:10%
will go.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.350 align:middle line:10%
So what Nordenstrom
did was, he figured,

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.630 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to stick a
probe into the tumor

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.480 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to
change the potential

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.590 align:middle line:10%
so much that the white cells
act like Pac-Men, bringing more

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:20.840 align:middle line:10%
white cells than the body would
have normally done because I'm

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.000 align:middle line:10%
doing these electrical changes.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:10%
And what happened?

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:30.130 align:middle line:10%
He noticed that the
cancer tumors disappeared.

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.750 align:middle line:10%
No side effects,
no adverse effects.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Breast cancer,
chest cancer tumors.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So now, how did these
2000 physicians receive his

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.220 align:middle line:90%
information?

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, they were
absolutely overwhelmed.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.030 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that people
hadn't heard of him.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But we brought him out
to the United States.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
The news program, which
was very big in '86, 20/20,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:84%
they actually came out and
interviewed Nordenstrom

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.800 align:middle line:90%
while he was visiting us.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.140 align:middle line:84%
And they interviewed
doctors at Harvard and Mayo

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and said, well what do
you think about this?

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
Here was their answer:
we don't have time

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.640 align:middle line:90%
to learn anything new.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.960 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: No, not really?

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.210 align:middle line:90%
That was their serious answer?

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:17.834 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: That was
their serious answer.

00:31:17.834 --> 00:31:19.190 align:middle line:10%
This is out of our realm.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.860 align:middle line:10%
This is physics; this is energy.

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:10%
We don't have time.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:30.010 align:middle line:10%
So Nordenstrom was very upset,
especially with the Los Angeles

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:33.705 align:middle line:10%
Times, who called him,
we have the chairman

00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:35.530 align:middle line:10%
of the Nobel assembly
was practicing

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.340 align:middle line:10%
alternative medicine.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I will guarantee you, I was next
to the man, he went nuclear.

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.260 align:middle line:90%
This man went nuclear.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.430 align:middle line:10%
He couldn't get anybody to
accept his theories here

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:51.140 align:middle line:10%
in the United States,
so he went to China.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.130 align:middle line:10%
He worked with the
Chinese doctors--

00:31:53.130 --> 00:32:01.080 align:middle line:10%
2,300 medical doctors
treated 13,000 patients

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.910 align:middle line:10%
with an effective cure
rate of 75 percent.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.512 align:middle line:10%
He gave his patent free
to the Chinese government

00:32:08.512 --> 00:32:10.470 align:middle line:10%
because the United States
wouldn't do anything.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:16.500 align:middle line:10%
So lest anybody think that
his system didn't work--

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.190 align:middle line:10%
and at the time they
said, well, there's

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.940 align:middle line:10%
not any experimentation.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.760 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.320 align:middle line:90%
Will you experiment?

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.210 align:middle line:90%
No, because we don't have time.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
find a chemical answer.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.270 align:middle line:90%
So Nordenstrom, have a nice day.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And this brilliant individual
went into the sunset

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.760 align:middle line:90%
and passed away.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.920 align:middle line:10%
Now, to finish this story,
as of one month ago,

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.470 align:middle line:10%
when I went to the website of
some of the medical doctors

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:50.980 align:middle line:10%
throughout the world using
Nordenstrom's therapy,

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.440 align:middle line:10%
the ones in the United States
said we cannot get any fair

00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:02.220 align:middle line:10%
tests from the FDA or the Cancer
Institute because they will

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:10%
only allow people to do
Nordenstrom's therapy in a test

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.170 align:middle line:10%
trial if they've exhausted
chemotherapy and radiation.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.830 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So essentially,
they kill the immune system

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.192 align:middle line:84%
and the people-- well, what's
the rest of that story?

00:33:17.192 --> 00:33:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I know there
was some experiments

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and they were given people
that were nearly dead.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Yes, and that
is exactly what happened.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
The individuals
are so near death.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.960 align:middle line:10%
This is what goes on in
this country over and over.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.946 align:middle line:10%
The non-pharmaceutical
items, whether it's--

00:33:36.946 --> 00:33:39.320 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: You can't test them
until they've been through

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.470 align:middle line:10%
this.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:40.386 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: That's right.

00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:41.650 align:middle line:10%
And that is the law.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.190 align:middle line:10%
This is why, one thing I will
say about the pharmaceutical,

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.600 align:middle line:10%
their money is very well spent.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Their $1.5 billion has
really set up an old boy,

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:52.397 align:middle line:10%
we're going to--

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:53.230 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Monopoly.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.450 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Monopoly, and
that's exactly what they are.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So really, you can't
legally get the tests done.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: Well, an
individual can do it,

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.150 align:middle line:84%
but the idea is that it'd
be into the mainstream,

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.780 align:middle line:84%
that it would get enough money
to really perfect things more.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Because again, it works for
a lot of different cancers,

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:14.814 align:middle line:90%
but if it's not the insurance--

00:34:14.814 --> 00:34:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: There's
no proper study done.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.771 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And the insurance
industry is not going to pay

00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:23.340 align:middle line:84%
for it, because it's an
unapproved technique or device.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And yet it is coming from the
chairman of the Nobel Assembly.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.469 align:middle line:90%
Final story about Nordenstrom.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:34.690 align:middle line:84%
He presents his big
book of his technique

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.159 align:middle line:84%
to the World Research
Foundation in LA.

00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:84%
We put the book into the
shelf and right next to it

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.037 align:middle line:90%
is this little book here.

00:34:45.037 --> 00:34:47.620 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Now, who put the book
in and how did you find that?

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Was it a coincidence
or did you know?

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: He wrote in his
book, "To the World Research

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:54.940 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.090 align:middle line:90%
--Bjorn Nordenstrom."

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And this book's about this
thick, and his name is N.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And this book was
written by Doctor Rae.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:08.750 align:middle line:10%
It's called, "The Application
of Electricity as a Therapeutic

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:10%
Agent."

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:14.340 align:middle line:10%
So I want you to flash back,
because Bjorn Nordenstrom

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.830 align:middle line:10%
has made the biomedical
discovery of the century.

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.460 align:middle line:10%
This is unbelievable.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.560 align:middle line:10%
So--

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.530 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: 1986.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.820 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: Now we look, and we
go and Nordstrom looks in here.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:10%
The doctor in this book shrank
breast cancer tumor, chest

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:36.610 align:middle line:10%
tumor, using electricity,
and the year was 1877.

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.080 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: More than
100 years prior to him.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.500 align:middle line:90%
And that was 30 years ago.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I will guarantee
you, because I was there,

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.680 align:middle line:84%
Nordstrom did not even
know this book existed.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But being a
librarian, of course--

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.310 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Of course,
you had to show him.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.810 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:51.700 align:middle line:10%
That's amazing.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:54.180 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: We keep
reinventing the wheel.

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:58.330 align:middle line:10%
Now, by the way, in
1877 the doctor said,

00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.610 align:middle line:10%
I didn't discover this.

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:02.750 align:middle line:10%
I saw some other doctor doing
it about eight years earlier.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.762 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So we're back into
the mid-1800s, more or less.

00:36:05.762 --> 00:36:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: All right, so we have
this incredible Nordenstrom.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.820 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
Harold Saxton Burr.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.590 align:middle line:90%


00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.200 align:middle line:10%
And this was 1986.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.300 align:middle line:10%
In 1954, at the
American Association

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:10%
of Gynecologists in
Chicago, Dr. Girard

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:31.900 align:middle line:10%
who only had 500 peer-reviewed,
published papers,

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.200 align:middle line:10%
made an incredible announcement.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.000 align:middle line:10%
I have called it in my
book, the cast-off cell.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.370 align:middle line:10%
He found with his associates
that one cell cast off

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:48.830 align:middle line:10%
in a woman's vaginal
tract, when they measured

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.890 align:middle line:10%
the electrical potential
difference between the inside

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.180 align:middle line:10%
of the cell and the
outside of the cell,

00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:00.070 align:middle line:10%
they could tell if a woman
had cervical or vaginal cancer

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:10%
in her system just
from that cell.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.880 align:middle line:10%
In their first
series of 57 cases,

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.700 align:middle line:10%
their system said
that 20 of the women

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:10%
had cancer in one
of those areas.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:10%
It ended up to be 18 out of
20 for a 94% success rate.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:10%
The other women, 37, were
said to not have cancer.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.550 align:middle line:10%
It was 100% accurate.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:35.727 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: And was it a
relatively simple test?

00:37:35.727 --> 00:37:37.060 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: It was a cast-off cell.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Cast-off cell
that they just measured

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.020 align:middle line:90%
the frequencies of.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yeah.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.210 align:middle line:90%
Now what happened with that?

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.730 align:middle line:10%
As I put it in my book,
"and nothing happened."

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.800 align:middle line:10%
Why wasn't that pursued?

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.535 align:middle line:10%
Why didn't it go further?

00:37:49.535 --> 00:37:51.410 align:middle line:10%
I laughed, I made a joke
actually in my book,

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:52.970 align:middle line:10%
because at the
end it said, we're

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.090 align:middle line:10%
looking to see if there's any
practical application for this.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:58.770 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, how about that?

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.520 align:middle line:10%
A test that could be like that.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.080 align:middle line:10%
The idea is, instead of
looking at new areas--

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:10.810 align:middle line:10%
I gave an example, you're
going into a new continent,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:14.110 align:middle line:10%
and you're told to explain it,
but you're only going north

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:10%
and you're supposed to tell
them what's on the periphery.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.610 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at everything.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Let us look at everything.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.460 align:middle line:84%
Those tests of the electrical
potential of the cell.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're talking about
equipment from the '50s.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Harold Saxton
Burr, we're talking

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.180 align:middle line:84%
about equipment from
the '20s and '30s

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.892 align:middle line:84%
that they had to
make up themselves.

00:38:32.892 --> 00:38:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And they're not
necessarily using the best

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.084 align:middle line:90%
of even in the day.

00:38:36.084 --> 00:38:37.375 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Right, not even close.

00:38:37.375 --> 00:38:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So now, look at how we
kind of have this pattern.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:45.270 align:middle line:84%
We have a Royal Rife, who talks
about frequency and has it.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:84%
We have a Harold
Saxton Burr who has

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.160 align:middle line:84%
been documenting
these special fields.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
We have another
individual, Dr. Girard,

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.580 align:middle line:90%
who is measuring the cells.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.700 align:middle line:90%
Everything here is electrical.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.201 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:00.201 --> 00:39:02.158 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: So I was going
to say, on that note,

00:39:02.158 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
would you mind if we
continue the conversation

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.670 align:middle line:90%
on frequencies?

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Because now we're looking
at an electrical spectrum

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.180 align:middle line:90%
that has color.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And that brings
us into a subject

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.600 align:middle line:90%
that really started you off.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Correct.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: And me too.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I was obsessed with color
therapy 30 years ago.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.179 align:middle line:90%
And that takes us to Dinshah.

00:39:22.179 --> 00:39:23.470 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes, Dinshah Ghadiali.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Yes, and so let's
start talking about what was

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:30.100 align:middle line:84%
being done and what was being
discovered just by way of color

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:30.660 align:middle line:90%
therapy.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the most natural
things in the world.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes, and it goes back.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And I like to go back for those
people more into the Biblical,

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:43.740 align:middle line:90%
God's covenant was the rainbow.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.090 align:middle line:90%
A rainbow of colors.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.320 align:middle line:90%
So now let's move it forward.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have a man
named Edwin Babbitt who

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.760 align:middle line:84%
wrote The Principles
of Light and Color

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:90%
in about the 1870s, 1860s.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And Dinshah Ghadiali from
India became very interested

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:03.480 align:middle line:90%
in color therapy.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.750 align:middle line:84%
Babbitt had a
seven- color system.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.930 align:middle line:84%
And Dinshah Ghadiali
actually came out

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.220 align:middle line:90%
with a 12-color system.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, what did this mean?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, Dinshah found that color
had a very profound effect

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.850 align:middle line:90%
on the physiology of the body.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.870 align:middle line:10%
Now, as we're
speaking about color,

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:31.610 align:middle line:10%
if I say a green color is
used, or a blue for arthritis,

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:10%
it's not necessarily
saying that the blue

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.610 align:middle line:10%
is doing the arthritis.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.960 align:middle line:10%
The blue is altering the
physiology of the body,

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:46.730 align:middle line:10%
and the body's defense mechanism
goes back into its mode

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.890 align:middle line:10%
that it's supposed to do
and the person is healed.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've made it
very simplistic.

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And when I give lectures
to medical doctors,

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.690 align:middle line:84%
I will always have somebody
going, I don't agree with it.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:90%
This color therapy.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.410 align:middle line:90%
This is hokey.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I go, doctor, what do you use
for infant liver syndrome,

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.480 align:middle line:90%
bilirubin, yellow jaundice?

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.014 align:middle line:90%
Well, we-- oh.

00:41:07.014 --> 00:41:07.930 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Blue light.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Yes, you put
them under a light.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't know
what you call it.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.480 align:middle line:90%
I call that color therapy.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine-- Dinshah
finds the colors

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:25.140 align:middle line:84%
for more than 350
different health problems,

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.920 align:middle line:84%
ones that are the cancers,
gonorrhea, syphilis.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.120 align:middle line:84%
But the question
is, do they work?

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, there were 500 US
doctors using color therapy

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:42.782 align:middle line:84%
in the '20s-- in the
late 1900s, early '20s.

00:41:42.782 --> 00:41:45.030 align:middle line:10%
One of them was
Dr. Kate Baldwin,

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.800 align:middle line:10%
somebody you're
familiar with, who

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.670 align:middle line:10%
was the head physician at
the oldest surgical hospital

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:53.880 align:middle line:10%
in the United States--
Philadelphia Women's Hospital.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.500 align:middle line:10%
She had 17 of his
machines there.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:00.270 align:middle line:10%
She was treating every
problem that we mentioned,

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:05.220 align:middle line:10%
and she swore in the Supreme
Court of the state of New York

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.560 align:middle line:10%
at a trial against
Dinshah, that she

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.580 align:middle line:10%
had rectified all of those
health problems just using

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.300 align:middle line:10%
color.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.860 align:middle line:10%
And the biggest one
was Grace Shirlow,

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.770 align:middle line:10%
who was a little girl
with third degree

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.800 align:middle line:10%
burns over 2/3 of her body.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.470 align:middle line:84%
And she was
completely rectified,

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:29.430 align:middle line:84%
new baby skin, no pain after
the first color treatment,

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.130 align:middle line:90%
just using color.

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:84%
So I, of course, was very
excited and interested as I

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.270 align:middle line:90%
learned more about Dinshah.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And we eventually have in our
archives all of the newsletters

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
he put out, all the doctors'
reports of what they were

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.550 align:middle line:90%
doing.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.020 align:middle line:10%
They were very successful.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.820 align:middle line:10%
Why did it stop?

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.830 align:middle line:10%
Well, in 1926, in
the AMA journal,

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.810 align:middle line:10%
they put out an
article and they said

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.730 align:middle line:10%
this big proponent of
color is wearing glasses.

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, none of this works.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And basically, if a
doctor is using color,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.420 align:middle line:84%
they're going to
lose their license.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.180 align:middle line:90%
End of color therapy.

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.700 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And
yet, the thing is,

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.230 align:middle line:84%
that's one technology that is
still readily available for all

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:18.040 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.040 align:middle line:84%
If someone wants to take
the time and trouble.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And I mentioned that
in the last interview.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.540 align:middle line:84%
If you want to dig a little
and educate yourself,

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.210 align:middle line:90%
you can still use color therapy.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And he's
written a beautiful book,

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Let There Be Light.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.460 align:middle line:84%
His son wrote that
book, Dinshah's son.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.610 align:middle line:84%
It lists 350 diseases
and illnesses

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and the specific colors that
work on those, how long you

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:90%
use them, what part of the body.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:47.051 align:middle line:84%
Of course, consult your
physician and be careful.

00:43:47.051 --> 00:43:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Make sure you
don't overdose on pink.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.758 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, I'm so
glad you said that,

00:43:50.758 --> 00:43:52.970 align:middle line:84%
because my next statement
was going to be,

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we've ever heard,
Mary Jane Smith was found

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.054 align:middle line:90%
OD'd in her home.

00:43:58.054 --> 00:43:59.220 align:middle line:90%
The color was blasting away.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.540 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Bathed
in a bath of blue.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: That's right,
it just doesn't happen.

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: What I found
playing with it in those days,

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:07.590 align:middle line:84%
because I also meditated a lot
and so forth and I just learned

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.770 align:middle line:84%
how to focus my attention, is I
would work with women in labor.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:13.370 align:middle line:84%
So I did this with my
friends and my sister.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.970 align:middle line:84%
When they'd go
into labor, I would

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.550 align:middle line:84%
be there in the room with
them and work on their feet

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and project color
into them with my mind

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.520 align:middle line:90%
and watch the fetal monitor.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty shocking.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:26.800 align:middle line:84%
And I would help my son,
back then, who had migraines.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.260 align:middle line:90%
You could watch the monitor.

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:33.430 align:middle line:10%
If you put blue into the uterine
area, the contractions stopped.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.080 align:middle line:10%
Put yellow back in
and, boom, they'd

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.670 align:middle line:10%
start right back up again.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:40.385 align:middle line:84%
And so this is something that
you can do even with the mind,

00:44:40.385 --> 00:44:41.190 align:middle line:90%
it's so natural.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Of course.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, what
they were doing,

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:84%
Edwin Babbitt was
the first person.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:49.255 align:middle line:84%
He, back in the 1870s,
he was charging water.

00:44:49.255 --> 00:44:50.970 align:middle line:90%
He would take a glass of water.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.200 align:middle line:10%
They would use the color
filters, which, by the way

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.580 align:middle line:10%
can be Roscolene filters
of a specific number, which

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.320 align:middle line:10%
are readily available.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.750 align:middle line:10%
It's very, very easy,
as you've mentioned.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:05.150 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to add this.

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:10.230 align:middle line:10%
My father, who according
to the hospital

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:14.210 align:middle line:10%
records for a big
HMO in Los Angeles

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:16.730 align:middle line:10%
was supposed to
be a quadriplegic,

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.320 align:middle line:10%
and they were going to
start quadriplegic training.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:25.960 align:middle line:84%
We used color therapy in
my dad's room twice a day,

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:26.670 align:middle line:90%
one hour.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And six weeks later, he walked
out of Kaiser Permanente,

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.830 align:middle line:84%
even though the
hospital records say,

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:36.920 align:middle line:84%
the patient has made
a tremendous recovery

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.710 align:middle line:90%
from complete quadriplegia.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:44.230 align:middle line:84%
So it works, it's possible,
it's readily available,

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.020 align:middle line:90%
and it's natural.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's natural.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, if you
feel like something's not

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:50.085 align:middle line:84%
right in your body,
you can even learn

00:45:50.085 --> 00:45:51.420 align:middle line:90%
what those frequencies are.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.610 align:middle line:84%
You can get the color
filters, use the lights,

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.700 align:middle line:84%
even use your mind projecting
the colors into that region

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.700 align:middle line:84%
and you'll start
getting some shifts.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:01.320 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I understand-- I
haven't got enough data on it,

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.300 align:middle line:84%
but in New Zealand they actually
were doing color therapy back

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.740 align:middle line:84%
80 or 100 years using
colored scarves.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:11.066 align:middle line:84%
So the color is
very, very important.

00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:11.690 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Yes.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, people who've
gone into deep past life

00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:17.080 align:middle line:84%
regressions that found
themselves in various healing

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.090 align:middle line:84%
facilities thousands
of years ago,

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:23.050 align:middle line:84%
they used to use
apertures in the ceiling

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:24.870 align:middle line:90%
in the domes of the centers.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.170 align:middle line:84%
When the sun would pass at
its brightest and fullest,

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the patient would be covered
in these various dyed,

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:33.794 align:middle line:90%
naturally dyed silk scarves.

00:46:33.794 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying thousands
of years ago.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:36.250 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: That's exactly right.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.625 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Thousands, but
that's deep memory from people.

00:46:38.625 --> 00:46:42.520 align:middle line:84%
So you know, it's not a
scientific study per se.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But that's come up in many,
many people's regressions,

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:45.800 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.250 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Color is
very important.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.570 align:middle line:90%
And we know what it does.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.750 align:middle line:84%
I, of course, am wearing
blue because everything

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:53.062 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you is the
gospel and the truth

00:46:53.062 --> 00:46:54.770 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And blue's
the color of truth.

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:55.561 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: True blue.

00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:56.890 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: True blue.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:00.550 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's go to now the
world of herbs and Dr, Kern

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.170 align:middle line:84%
and what he was doing because
that's something where that's

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:06.720 align:middle line:84%
going to send people
sprinting for Germany.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.030 align:middle line:10%
>>ROSS: Yes, Dr. Kern and
most of the individuals

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:15.230 align:middle line:10%
or the stories, I've
either met the people

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.280 align:middle line:10%
or have a lot of documentation.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.510 align:middle line:10%
But Dr. Kern I did meet
before he passed away.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.680 align:middle line:10%
Now, Dr. Kern was a
physician in Germany.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.920 align:middle line:10%
And he made a very, very
interesting discovery.

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.760 align:middle line:10%
It was his job to do
autopsies on soldiers

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.480 align:middle line:10%
who were killed in the war.

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And even though it might
have been a bullet, which

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:42.880 align:middle line:84%
is pretty obvious, they still
had to go and do an autopsy.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, he's doing autopsies on
18-year-olds, 19-year-olds,

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:50.630 align:middle line:84%
20-year-olds, and he's noticing
that their arteries are all

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.010 align:middle line:90%
clogged.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.650 align:middle line:90%
The proper word is an occlusion.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:56.810 align:middle line:10%
That they're 90 percent
occlusion in the main arteries,

00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:02.360 align:middle line:10%
yet you don't hear of young
people dying of a heart attack.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.310 align:middle line:84%
So he started wondering,
what's the deal here?

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.520 align:middle line:84%
How are these people living
with their arteries blocked?

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well, assuming it was
stress that was causing a lot

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:14.990 align:middle line:84%
of these issues if they're
on the battlefield,

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.440 align:middle line:90%
plus diet and whatnot.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.190 align:middle line:90%
So they had-- OK.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.840 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Well, so they had this.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So he starts
investigating further.

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And he comes up
with the discovery

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:31.380 align:middle line:84%
that other pathways, when
your main arteries are

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:36.830 align:middle line:84%
clogged, other pathways
of blood become activated.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you live in a big
city and the freeway's jammed,

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:40.840 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:90%
You take side streets.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, in medicine they're
called collaterals.

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:84%
He found that there was
more blood going in.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, this if this
was just doctor Kern,

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.120 align:middle line:90%
you'd go, who is this doctor?

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.800 align:middle line:10%
But Dr. Baraldi of the
Armed Forces Institute

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.860 align:middle line:10%
of Pathology in
the United States

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.110 align:middle line:10%
mapped out all of the
thousands of collaterals

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:11.420 align:middle line:10%
in the heart where blood
then goes into the heart--

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:16.250 align:middle line:10%
more blood than was there when
the artery was flowing freely.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:19.070 align:middle line:10%
So now we have a little
bit of a dilemma here.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:23.340 align:middle line:10%
I am saying that the
artery is clogged.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:24.780 align:middle line:90%
There's more blood in there.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:26.160 align:middle line:90%
So what is the pain?

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.970 align:middle line:90%
What did people feeling?

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, he found in
the left ventricle,

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.990 align:middle line:84%
the pH balance
had changed, which

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:38.810 align:middle line:84%
caused like a little hole,
which is the pain, not in 100%,

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:44.280 align:middle line:84%
but he found what we're talking
about in 95% of the people,

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.070 align:middle line:90%
this is what was going on.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So he discovered an African
herb called strophanthin g.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And when the strophanthin
g is taken into the body,

00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:03.210 align:middle line:84%
in 10 minutes, the pH balance
goes completely back to normal

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.390 align:middle line:84%
in the heart and the person
doesn't have any pain.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:09.740 align:middle line:84%
They also have full
blood in there.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, somebody else
might say, come on.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:18.750 align:middle line:84%
However, in several medical
magazines in the United States,

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:23.120 align:middle line:84%
they have come out and said,
our medical model for the heart

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.320 align:middle line:90%
is incorrect.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But now heart bypass
is a big business.

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Putting stints in
is a big business.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:33.502 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And you're saying
this herb basically takes care

00:50:33.502 --> 00:50:34.390 align:middle line:90%
of a lot of it.

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:38.760 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: They did a 20-year
study in Stuttgart with tens

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:41.300 align:middle line:90%
of thousands of patients.

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.870 align:middle line:10%
And they found that the people
who are on strophanthin,

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:49.310 align:middle line:10%
out of 20,000, there were
only 5 second heart attacks

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.090 align:middle line:10%
and nobody's ever
died on strophanthin.

00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.180 align:middle line:10%
Now, here was a
big test they did.

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.230 align:middle line:10%
They went to a mine.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.630 align:middle line:10%
Miners underground would
have a heart attack.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:03.120 align:middle line:10%
By the time they brought the
miners up and to the hospital,

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:07.000 align:middle line:10%
during a 10 year period
they had x amount of deaths.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.790 align:middle line:10%
When they put the
strophanthin at the mine

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.510 align:middle line:10%
and they went through
a 25 year period,

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:17.707 align:middle line:10%
no miner ever died of a heart
attack with the strophanthin g.

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:20.040 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's why I was
saying this will send people

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:20.920 align:middle line:10%
running to Germany.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.340 align:middle line:84%
People that have heart issues
and want to get off you

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.850 align:middle line:90%
want to get off the drugs.

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:29.309 align:middle line:84%
So can you-- I mean how do you--
if someone's listening to this,

00:51:29.309 --> 00:51:31.850 align:middle line:84%
of course, it's very upsetting
to think that it's right there

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:32.770 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get it.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:34.680 align:middle line:90%
How can you get it?

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.220 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: It has to be a
prescription from a doctor

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:42.900 align:middle line:10%
and, in Germany, I believe I
have heard that there are some

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:47.160 align:middle line:10%
individual medical people
doing something here.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.330 align:middle line:10%
So I would Google strophanthin
g or contact World Research

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:52.100 align:middle line:10%
Foundation.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:55.140 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: Strophanthin--
S-T-R-O-V-A-N-T-I-N.

00:51:55.140 --> 00:52:01.780 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: No, it's S-T-R-O-P-H--
strophanthin-- A-N-T-H-I-N.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:04.290 align:middle line:10%
And I would challenge
anybody in the medical field,

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:07.690 align:middle line:10%
because they're going to
have to-- I'm not the one.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:12.630 align:middle line:10%
It's Dr. Baraldi with
all the collaterals.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:17.480 align:middle line:10%
It is the medical journals
that are saying, wow.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.840 align:middle line:10%
There is more blood.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.740 align:middle line:10%
Which brings us to this point.

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.680 align:middle line:10%
When you give someone
nitroglycerin,

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:25.230 align:middle line:10%
that's forcing more blood in.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:26.950 align:middle line:84%
There's already
enough blood in there.

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.750 align:middle line:84%
So that can be
very, very damaging.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Am I recommending people
take strophanthin g?

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:33.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.900 align:middle line:84%
But I am recommending that
people become educated.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.410 align:middle line:90%
That they look.

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:41.085 align:middle line:84%
And it gives me a good
chance to say, challenge

00:52:41.085 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:84%
your medical professional
to explain to you why

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.799 align:middle line:84%
you are doing something and
what all the ramifications are.

00:52:48.799 --> 00:52:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And maybe if
you're going on vacation,

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.750 align:middle line:84%
you might want to take a
little stop off in Germany.

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:53.708 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: I would do it.

00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:55.125 align:middle line:84%
And probably load
it into candies.

00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:56.666 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: If you
have heart disease,

00:52:56.666 --> 00:52:58.999 align:middle line:84%
if you can afford a ticket
over there to find this kind

00:52:58.999 --> 00:52:59.540 align:middle line:90%
of solution--

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.581 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Oh, by the way,
I forgot to tell you how

00:53:01.581 --> 00:53:02.570 align:middle line:90%
expensive it is.

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:07.457 align:middle line:10%
Oh, gosh, a pill was like $1.

00:53:07.457 --> 00:53:08.800 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: That's it.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.040 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm just asking
the nuts and bolts

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.420 align:middle line:84%
stuff for people that
might be interested.

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>ROSS: You've come to the
right guy for the nuts and the--

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:17.411 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: I know I have.

00:53:17.411 --> 00:53:20.050 align:middle line:84%
If you establish a relationship
with a German doctor,

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.860 align:middle line:84%
are they even allowed
to send it to you?

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.600 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: I think there's
a candy called Smarties.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.327 align:middle line:90%
It's like our M&M's.

00:53:27.327 --> 00:53:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it comes through in those.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:29.710 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Maybe-- OK.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:30.764 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: In boxes.

00:53:30.764 --> 00:53:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: I guess
do your own research.

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.990 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.550 align:middle line:90%
Do your own research.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:34.800 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Do your own research.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.550 align:middle line:90%
Contact us.

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:39.990 align:middle line:84%
We have a packet of information
on it which will inform people.

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:43.140 align:middle line:84%
By the way, strophanthin
and diapoles.

00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.150 align:middle line:84%
I did consulting for
Mutual Benefit Life,

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:49.290 align:middle line:84%
which was the ninth largest
insurance company in the United

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:50.660 align:middle line:90%
States.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:53.080 align:middle line:10%
We did this program
for three years.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:57.390 align:middle line:10%
I worked under the auspices of
the president of Mutual Benefit

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:00.060 align:middle line:10%
Life, who had formed
a research division.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.950 align:middle line:84%
They investigated
strophanthin g and had it

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:09.300 align:middle line:84%
examined at the Colorado School
of Health Ethics, a location

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.560 align:middle line:84%
that examines technologies
for their efficacy,

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.410 align:middle line:84%
and they said, based on
everything that they saw,

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:18.290 align:middle line:84%
they put it in writing: this is
one of the greatest discoveries

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:20.330 align:middle line:90%
in the history of medicine.

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:22.930 align:middle line:10%
And they also
comment on how easy

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:26.200 align:middle line:10%
it will be interjected
into the system.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Forget about it.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.600 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: Not happening.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Not happening here.

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.590 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you have a
little more information

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:32.460 align:middle line:90%
than you had before.

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:35.045 align:middle line:84%
And you know you can always
book a cheap ticket to Germany.

00:54:35.045 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:38.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would like to-- we just
have a few minutes left-- five,

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:42.210 align:middle line:84%
six minutes left-- and I would
like to talk about Burzynski.

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:44.250 align:middle line:90%
What he's been through.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.930 align:middle line:84%
Really some wonderful
outcomes to that story,

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.180 align:middle line:90%
although he still has trouble.

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.330 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about the man.

00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:51.621 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Two of my favorite
practitioners in the United

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:56.040 align:middle line:84%
States, Stanislaw Burzynski in
Houston using antineoplastons,

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and Dr. Nicholas Gonzales with
his enzyme therapy in New York.

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski works
with geoplastomas

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:08.300 align:middle line:84%
in the brain, which the
success rate of modern medicine

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.160 align:middle line:90%
is very low.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.205 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: That
means tumors, right?

00:55:10.205 --> 00:55:10.746 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: Yes.

00:55:10.746 --> 00:55:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them inoperable,
and standard medicine really

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.140 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have much.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:18.970 align:middle line:84%
We invited Burzynski to
speak at our 1986 congress.

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:21.380 align:middle line:90%
We taped it so we have that.

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:25.580 align:middle line:84%
He has been prosecuted by the
authorities for years and years

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:28.250 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Texas.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Yet the city of
Houston protects him

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:34.620 align:middle line:84%
because he actually treated
some of the children

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.260 align:middle line:90%
of the politicians.

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.760 align:middle line:10%
But their local state board
has been trying to put him out

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:45.160 align:middle line:10%
of business, and some of the
insurance companies who felt

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:49.670 align:middle line:10%
slighted that they gave him
money when he didn't really

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:55.160 align:middle line:10%
have an approved technique, even
though the patients were saved.

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.030 align:middle line:10%
I brought the medical
doctor head physician

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:01.890 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Anthony Terisanko
from Mutual Benefit Life

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:04.490 align:middle line:10%
to the offices of both doctors.

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:07.520 align:middle line:10%
They pulled out files
of patients at random

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:13.390 align:middle line:10%
and proved and saw by
themselves that Burzynski's work

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.810 align:middle line:10%
is very profound and successful.

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:19.360 align:middle line:10%
And Doctor Nicholas
Gonzales also.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.530 align:middle line:10%
I know we have short
time, but I want to say--

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.920 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: No, please.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.044 align:middle line:10%
We have a few more minutes.

00:56:23.044 --> 00:56:24.930 align:middle line:10%
You can talk about him a bit.

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:26.220 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:31.710 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Burzynski has won
awards at different countries

00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:33.730 align:middle line:90%
for innovative cancer research.

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Back when I first
came as a consultant

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.388 align:middle line:84%
for Mutual Benefit
Life, they asked,

00:56:39.388 --> 00:56:43.410 align:middle line:84%
Mutual Benefit Life asked
the American Cancer Society,

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the quackbusters, what they
had on doctor Burzynski.

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:51.150 align:middle line:84%
They came back, he's a quack,
no published, peer-reviewed

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:52.320 align:middle line:90%
papers.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:56.520 align:middle line:10%
That is what they sent to
Mutual Benefit Life's research

00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.870 align:middle line:10%
division.

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:01.380 align:middle line:10%
When I supplied Burzynski's
background papers

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:06.910 align:middle line:10%
to Mutual Benefit Life and Bob
Maver, who's the head actuary,

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:08.010 align:middle line:10%
they had a dilemma.

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:10.360 align:middle line:10%
He had more than 100
published papers.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:15.080 align:middle line:10%
So why did the Cancer Society
and the quote "quackbusters"

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.380 align:middle line:10%
say this?

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:19.560 align:middle line:84%
When they got back to
them, Mutual Benefit Life,

00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:23.530 align:middle line:84%
their answer was, oh,
our records are behind.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:24.945 align:middle line:90%
The Cancer Society.

00:57:24.945 --> 00:57:28.219 align:middle line:84%
God, if we had more money
we would be more up to date.

00:57:28.219 --> 00:57:30.010 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Rather than
making a phone call.

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> ROSS: It's a travesty.

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:34.970 align:middle line:90%
It is this stifling.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
Nick Gonzales if I can.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:40.550 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Let's talk
about the epilogue here,

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:43.740 align:middle line:84%
because he is still
being protected.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:48.290 align:middle line:84%
You were telling me off-camera
that a particular judge--

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:52.174 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, this was very
interesting because there was

00:57:52.174 --> 00:57:55.150 align:middle line:84%
a case-- there
were several cases,

00:57:55.150 --> 00:58:00.180 align:middle line:84%
I believe six or seven insurance
companies have sued Burzynski.

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.280 align:middle line:90%
And they've lost every time.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.440 align:middle line:84%
They have lost because the
patients were still alive.

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.620 align:middle line:84%
But one of the cases
was from Prudential.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:13.020 align:middle line:84%
It was the Billy Brown
case, which is sealed.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.670 align:middle line:84%
But the end result was,
when that trial finally

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:20.470 align:middle line:84%
came before the
judge years later,

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.785 align:middle line:90%
Billy Brown was still alive.

00:58:22.785 --> 00:58:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: And the judge could
see what was in the sealed

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:25.830 align:middle line:90%
envelope.

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Well, the judge
is the one that authorized

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.850 align:middle line:84%
the sealing, because it was
Prudential who sealed it.

00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:34.630 align:middle line:84%
It was Prudential
that said no, there's

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:36.360 align:middle line:90%
not going to be any more facts.

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.660 align:middle line:90%
So I have to be careful, too.

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But I'm only going to say,
let's put it this way.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:45.320 align:middle line:84%
The judge was very much
against the insurance company.

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:50.330 align:middle line:84%
And Burzynski has been
persecuted over and over

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:53.920 align:middle line:84%
because he has patents
that will change medicine,

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:58.170 align:middle line:84%
and if he's put away,
some other company

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:00.270 align:middle line:84%
is going to get those
patents, and they

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.320 align:middle line:90%
are going to make their money.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.900 align:middle line:84%
Burzynski is one of the great
doctors that I have ever met.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.730 align:middle line:90%
And just his personality.

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:10.260 align:middle line:90%
Just an incredible person.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.790 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: Well at least a judge
or two is trying to protect

00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:13.817 align:middle line:90%
him.

00:59:13.817 --> 00:59:16.400 align:middle line:84%
There are good people that are
trying to bring things forward.

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.190 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: And I
want to share this.

00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:20.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, also, from
previous interviews,

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:22.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very positive person.

00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:24.970 align:middle line:90%
I believe in love and beauty.

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps we'll get a chance
to get into that sometime.

00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I don't want people to think
it's ranting, it's raving,

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:31.140 align:middle line:90%
it's negative.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:31.830 align:middle line:90%
>> REGINA: It's information.

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:33.580 align:middle line:10%
>> ROSS: But it's
life and death.

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>> REGINA: It is,
and it's education.

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:37.020 align:middle line:90%
And Stephen we're out of time.

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.200 align:middle line:90%
I want to thank you so much.

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.949 align:middle line:84%
>> ROSS: Regina, thank
you for both shows.

00:59:39.949 --> 00:59:42.330 align:middle line:84%
>> REGINA: It's always
enlightening and a delight.

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:44.660 align:middle line:10%
To become involved with
the World Research Fund,

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.740 align:middle line:10%
you can go to wrf.org.

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:49.400 align:middle line:10%
If you're looking for the
history of a healing modality

00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:51.480 align:middle line:10%
on a very particular
disease or condition,

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.580 align:middle line:10%
they will compile text from
throughout the ages for you.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, you can
also take action

00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:58.320 align:middle line:84%
by choosing to go
a new way with some

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.840 align:middle line:84%
of the many wonderful
alternative therapists

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and doctors out there
who are doing good work.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.510 align:middle line:84%
In the end, where we
choose to place our faith,

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:07.720 align:middle line:84%
goodwill, and money
will determine

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.190 align:middle line:90%
the health care of the future.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:13.240 align:middle line:10%
Until next time, thank you for
joining us here on Gaiam TV.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:34.934 align:middle line:90%
