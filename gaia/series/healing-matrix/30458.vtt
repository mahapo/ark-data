00:00:33.647 --> 00:00:36.230 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA MEREDITH: This is how
it goes for millions of people.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:90%
You're smart.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.040 align:middle line:84%
You're capable, yet when
you wake up each morning,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.970 align:middle line:84%
you have a sense of dread, fear,
or even panic to begin the day.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:10%
There's no rational reason
for these terrible feelings

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.730 align:middle line:10%
to have taken root.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.850 align:middle line:10%
This is the key.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 align:middle line:10%
No logical reason
means that you likely

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.800 align:middle line:10%
have a problem that is either
lifestyle or biochemically

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:10%
based.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.000 align:middle line:84%
Today's guest, Trudy
Scott, has written

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
a book titled "The
Anti-Anxiety Food Solution."

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Trudy is here to tell us that
a good deal of our anxiety

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
can be easily managed by some
simple changes in lifestyle,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.220 align:middle line:84%
diet, and supplementation
often eliminating the need

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:90%
to turn to pharmaceuticals.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.160 align:middle line:84%
And wow, this is
really good news

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.330 align:middle line:90%
for an awful lot of people.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And you have changed
the lives of how many?

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.520 align:middle line:84%
hundreds, thousands
of people by now?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.386 align:middle line:84%
>>TRUDY SCOTT:
Thousands of people.

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thousands.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:90%
And you lecture all over.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.274 align:middle line:90%
So here we are.

00:01:22.274 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: It's so
great to be here.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.764 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:10%
And it's so wonderful to
be able to go out and share

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.820 align:middle line:10%
this information because
so many people don't

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:10%
make this powerful connection
between what we eat

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.235 align:middle line:10%
and how we feel.

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:32.837 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:35.170 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: And I'm on a mission
to share that information.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.820 align:middle line:10%
And there's so much research
supporting it, that we really

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.404 align:middle line:10%
need to make it
mainstream, really do.

00:01:39.404 --> 00:01:40.486 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, absolutely.

00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:42.280 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
percentages of people

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:84%
that are on mood altering
pharmaceuticals right now

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.710 align:middle line:84%
that have some really
truly awful side effects,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.579 align:middle line:84%
it seems like it's time for this
message to be taken seriously.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.384 align:middle line:90%
We need to go back to basics.

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.050 align:middle line:84%
We need to eat like
our grandparents ate

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.455 align:middle line:84%
or our great grandparents
in some cases.

00:01:57.455 --> 00:02:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But we just need to go back
to basics and eat real food,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and then also eat food that
suits our own biochemistry.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Because we're all unique.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.824 align:middle line:84%
Some people may have
a problem of gluten.

00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:08.740 align:middle line:84%
Someone else may have a
problem with caffeine.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.979 align:middle line:84%
So we need to figure
out what the issue is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.291 align:middle line:90%
that is causing your anxiety.

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.790 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's
a real key here

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.650 align:middle line:84%
because some people, some
of you listening to this,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
will not like some
of the information.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.210 align:middle line:84%
But you have to remember,
this show is specifically

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
ordered toward mood, mood
conditions and disorders,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:90%
depression, anxiety, et cetera.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So even though some
of what you're saying

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
will not be welcome news for
people at large, especially

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.740 align:middle line:84%
when we start talking
about things like caffeine,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.392 align:middle line:84%
again, this is very
specific if you

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:84%
want to take care of this
one particular issue.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.016 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
always have the choice

00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
to just keep eating
a trash diet,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.275 align:middle line:84%
doing things that are not
compatible with our body,

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:46.900 align:middle line:84%
and then just throwing
a drug after it.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But there's
a price to pay.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And so many people
just tolerate that.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: The other
thing that I really

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
want to get through
to all my clients

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.667 align:middle line:84%
is don't just
tolerate feeling bad.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, some people
have felt so bad

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.092 align:middle line:84%
for so long they don't remember
what it felt like to feel good.

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:84%
One of my clients
actually came to see me

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:84%
because she wanted
to you lose weight.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.016 align:middle line:84%
And she had just been
diagnosed with diabetes,

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:90%
and she needed some energy.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.598 align:middle line:84%
And she filled in
the questionnaire

00:03:10.598 --> 00:03:11.700 align:middle line:90%
that I have my clients do.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And she's had worry
as a 10, anxiety

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
as an 8, perfectionism,
controlling,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.514 align:middle line:90%
all of these, depression.

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you
realize this is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
what I can actually
help you with.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And she said, no, I didn't think
you could because just like

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.699 align:middle line:84%
my eyes are blue, and I can't
change the color of my eyes,

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:28.740 align:middle line:90%
I can't change my nature.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:84%
I've been like
this my whole life.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's one part,
people just being

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.965 align:middle line:84%
like that their whole lives
and not even realizing it.

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:34.400 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: They've accepted it.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's the other issue
where people are getting older,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.436 align:middle line:84%
maybe a woman going
into menopause.

00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:41.060 align:middle line:84%
And they just think,
well, it's normal.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.850 align:middle line:90%
My mom had it.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:90%
My grandmother had it.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.500 align:middle line:90%
I've got it.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.796 align:middle line:90%
I just have to put up with it.

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:90%
And we don't have to.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:90%
We can actually change it.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And using food and nutrients
are just so powerful.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, let's
do a little backstory.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Because you're a very
sportif, you know, person.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.474 align:middle line:84%
You're involved in mountain
climbing and hiking and skiing

00:03:58.474 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
wonderful things.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
And you have been
throughout your life.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:84%
You and your husband
are from South Africa,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.654 align:middle line:84%
which is why your
cute little accent--

00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:06.444 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Thank you.

00:04:06.444 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: We find it very
endearing and charming here.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:84%
Yet, you still were suffering
to a very large extent from some

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.620 align:middle line:84%
of these very disorders
we're talking about.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And maybe you can
give us an idea

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
of what your life was
like before you decided

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
to take control of it yourself.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, as you
said, I'm a sporty person.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm an adventurer.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I've done some crazy things
on rock faces, you know,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
sleeping on a portaledge on
the side of the cliff face.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And we actually met
in the mountains.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And we got married
and had our honeymoon

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.900 align:middle line:90%
on top of Mount Kilimanjaro.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So I've done some very
adventurous things.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't consider
myself timid or anxious.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.540 align:middle line:84%
But in my late 30s I started
to get increasingly anxious

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.850 align:middle line:90%
for no reason at all.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.465 align:middle line:84%
I would just wake with this
pounding heart, this sort

00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:50.900 align:middle line:84%
of fear of everything,
a sense of doom.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
And I clearly remember
my first panic attack.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.889 align:middle line:90%
I had come back from work.

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I was actually working
in corporate America

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:90%
at the time in a computer job.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And we'd been for
a nice bike ride.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking about work.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:84%
And this panic
attack just hit me.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.142 align:middle line:90%
And I was hyperventilating.

00:05:05.142 --> 00:05:06.850 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:90%
I had the clammy skin.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And I get goosebumps
when I talk about this.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.100 align:middle line:90%
Because it was so terrifying.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.411 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And I really
thought I was going to die.

00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.310 align:middle line:90%
It was just so, so scary.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.351 align:middle line:84%
And that galvanized
me into thinking

00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:19.850 align:middle line:84%
there's got to be something
that I've got to do about it now

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.340 align:middle line:84%
because I'd had
the panic attack.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.890 align:middle line:84%
But with my bringing
in South Africa

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
and eating real whole food and
not going to the doctor a lot,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.367 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think
about medication.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And I worked with a
nurse practitioner

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.899 align:middle line:84%
and naturopathic physician
and started to find solutions.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.732 align:middle line:84%
And the more I dug, the
more interest that I

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
got and eventually
went back to school

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.830 align:middle line:84%
to study to become
a nutritionist.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
And this has become
my life work,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.840 align:middle line:84%
to show other people
that they can totally

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
eliminate their anxiety
and panic attacks.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
any more anxiety.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I had three panic attacks
total and no more.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.350 align:middle line:90%
And I feel great.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I was
really anxious as well

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
during that time,
there's no way I

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.220 align:middle line:84%
could have gone and
some something like this

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle line:84%
or gone up in front of a hundred
people at a presentation.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.839 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm cool and
calm and collected.

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:01.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thank goodness.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
It would have been
difficult for me,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.859 align:middle line:84%
too, with you
hyperventilating and sweating.

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:06.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So you also
studied with someone

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.540 align:middle line:84%
who is also well-known
in this field

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and had just a beautiful
apprenticeship,

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like, for a couple
years with her as well.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.989 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can talk a
little bit about what

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:19.757 align:middle line:84%
she did as a bit
of your backstory.

00:06:19.757 --> 00:06:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
So when I actually
finished my studying

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and I decided that this was the
area that I wanted to focus on,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to work with
some really great people.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And Julia Ross is the
author of "The Mood Cure."

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.310 align:middle line:84%
And I worked in her clinic for
two years after I graduated.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And she's just a pioneer
in the use of amino acids

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
and using biochemistry
and food and a whole bunch

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
of other things that actually
help people feel great.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And working with her,
and learning from her,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and working with all the clients
that came into the clinic

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.830 align:middle line:90%
was absolutely fantastic.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And there are a
lot of great people

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.267 align:middle line:90%
who do a lot of this work.

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And what I wanted to
do when I wrote my book

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.180 align:middle line:84%
was pull all the
information from all

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.049 align:middle line:84%
these other great
practitioners who

00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:01.590 align:middle line:84%
had been using
different parts of it.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And her expertise are the amino
acids, which are miracles.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:90%
They really are miracles--

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: --for ending anxiety
and stopping sugar cravings

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.070 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, we're
going to talk about that

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.823 align:middle line:90%
more toward the end of the show.

00:07:11.823 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
Let's get into some of the
conditions, symptomologies,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.385 align:middle line:90%
some of the stats.

00:07:16.385 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go into the
flow of some of the foods that

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:84%
are really helpful in
reversing those conditions.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
we'll go into some

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
of the supplementation
and that big juicy bit

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
you just talked
about, amino acids.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.210 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So first
of all, give us

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of an idea
about the rise of anxiety

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.630 align:middle line:90%
and depression in society.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.030 align:middle line:84%
I know the stats are pretty
astounding in a negative way.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So about 18% of
the population in the US

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:84%
has some kind of
anxiety disorder,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
be it panic, or social
anxiety, or generalized

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.380 align:middle line:90%
anxiety disorder.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.172 align:middle line:84%
And I think the numbers
are even higher.

00:07:48.172 --> 00:07:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Because people who
don't go to the doctor

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.560 align:middle line:90%
are not being counted.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I was
going to ask that.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.170 align:middle line:84%
That's only those who
have been diagnosed.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.878 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:55.770 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What
about a person who

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.037 align:middle line:84%
A, the kind that has a sense
of perfection, I can do it all?

00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Those aren't people who
normally would go to the doctor.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.150 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If they're not
feeling right, they're like,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.233 align:middle line:90%
something's wrong with me.

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.016 align:middle line:90%
I have to find a way to fix it.

00:08:06.016 --> 00:08:08.550 align:middle line:84%
You must see a lot of people
like that in your clientele.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.460 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: A lot of people, yes.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So then if you're
looking at real numbers,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.746 align:middle line:84%
we might be looking at
something more like one

00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:14.510 align:middle line:90%
in four instead of one in five.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: That's very possible.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.411 align:middle line:90%
And the numbers are increasing.

00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:19.535 align:middle line:84%
And we see higher numbers
in the Western countries,

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:22.165 align:middle line:84%
where we're eating the standard
American diet, the junk food

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:22.665 align:middle line:90%
diet.

00:08:22.665 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.261 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And we're seeing
the numbers increasing.

00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing is with the
numbers that are increasing,

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.450 align:middle line:84%
we do see women being affected
at twice the rate of men.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.820 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Why is that?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: It's a
number of factors.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.646 align:middle line:84%
One thing is that-- I
work mostly with women.

00:08:37.646 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I do work with men as well,
but I work mostly with women.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And most of my
clients, you know,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:84%
they're taking care
of their families.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:90%
They're working a busy job.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.702 align:middle line:84%
So we, as women,
we're care takers.

00:08:47.702 --> 00:08:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And we take less
care of ourselves.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:90%
That might be one factor.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.557 align:middle line:84%
Another factor is
the hormonal aspect.

00:08:52.557 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:84%
So we've got hormones
changing throughout our lives.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And then a third aspect
is actually serotonin.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And serotonin we often
associate with depression.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.090 align:middle line:84%
But people with low
serotonin can also

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.430 align:middle line:84%
have anxiety in the head, the
ruminating thoughts, the worry

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:07.320 align:middle line:90%
in the head.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And women make less
serotonin than men.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:09.736 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:09:09.736 --> 00:09:11.540 align:middle line:84%
I've read about
that study before.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's for a
variety of reasons

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.090 align:middle line:84%
that are deeply
societal, you might even

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.690 align:middle line:84%
say passed-on genetics and such,
about the condition that women

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.280 align:middle line:84%
have lived under for
the last thousand

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.430 align:middle line:84%
or several thousand
years of course.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.990 align:middle line:84%
There's a lesser
sense of control,

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.940 align:middle line:84%
which does create a low
level anxiety within being.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
So men, too,
though, a lot of men

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.320 align:middle line:84%
have a lot of these disorders,
but oftentimes won't

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.980 align:middle line:90%
go get help.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.870 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll just pop a beer.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.411 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.670 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the fact that we're
seeing more women with anxiety,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:84%
we think it's double--
there may actually

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:84%
be more men that we
don't know about.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.363 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually working with
a gentleman at the moment,

00:09:47.363 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:90%
and he's a big construction guy.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.680 align:middle line:84%
And he says he was embarrassed
to tell people he was anxious.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.610 align:middle line:84%
And since he's been
working with me,

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.270 align:middle line:84%
he's been opening
up in his church

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and with some of his
colleagues saying he's anxious.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And more of his
friends are telling him

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.530 align:middle line:90%
that they're anxious, too.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.639 align:middle line:84%
And now he said, I want to make
this my life work to draw this

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:07.680 align:middle line:84%
out of men, so they'll
actually go and seek help.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:07.880 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, wow.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.789 align:middle line:90%
That's fabulous.

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: So you might be right.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe men are anxious,
and they're not actually

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.656 align:middle line:90%
admitting to it.

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:14.435 align:middle line:84%
And men tend to be
under-reporters often.

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
I find when I'm
working with men,

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
they will often
under-report their symptoms.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, women will say
exactly how they feel.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So anxiety isn't just
a matter of feeling

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.880 align:middle line:84%
jittery and anxious
about what's going

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.180 align:middle line:84%
to happen to yourself,
your day, your future.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.530 align:middle line:84%
It actually has physical
repercussions as well.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk about
having persistent anxiety

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.207 align:middle line:90%
and what it does to the body?

00:10:33.207 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, we need to
really take it seriously

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
because it puts a huge
strain on the heart.

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And this is another reason why
I want people to not just put up

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.950 align:middle line:90%
with it and tolerate it.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
There's now research showing
that the more anxious

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
you are, the more stressed
you are, the more at risk

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:84%
you are for heart
disease and stroke.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.770 align:middle line:90%
So it raises cortisol levels.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:84%
It actually can
increase blood clotting.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.880 align:middle line:84%
It messes up your
basic hormone balance.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So we do need to take it
seriously and do something

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
about it and not wait till
we have a panic attack.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Do something before
it gets to that.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.585 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again, this
is hidden a lot of times.

00:11:07.585 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people you would think,
oh, they have it all together.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.668 align:middle line:84%
You would never
guess that anything

00:11:11.668 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:90%
might be going on underneath it.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.342 align:middle line:84%
Their girlfriends look
up to them and so forth.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, those
are the very people

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.174 align:middle line:90%
that are having the issues.

00:11:18.174 --> 00:11:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Those who have this sense
of perfection and drive

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.959 align:middle line:84%
are some of the
most often affected.

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:23.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:90%
They deal with it.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.790 align:middle line:90%
They cover it up.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.581 align:middle line:84%
And they just pretend
that everything's OK,

00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:28.485 align:middle line:84%
whereas they're not
really feeling so great.

00:11:28.485 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So there's one
saying in your book, which

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.650 align:middle line:84%
I think some people have heard
already, which is Hippocrates'

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.460 align:middle line:84%
saying, "let food
be your medicine

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and medicine be your food."

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we've gotten
completely away from that.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And we don't need to go
into the reasons why.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:84%
I've done quite a
few shows with people

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.450 align:middle line:84%
on how the pharmaceutical
industry made its inroads

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and how food started taking a
back seat to pharmaceuticals

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
in terms of all of
our health care.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So now, let's talk about some
specific things about brain

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.850 align:middle line:84%
chemistry itself
and mood disorders.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.140 align:middle line:84%
What are some of
the chemicals that

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.860 align:middle line:84%
are most often
involved in anxiety,

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.300 align:middle line:84%
and then also the same
thing with depression?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And how do you differentiate
between those clients?

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And does one often
lead to the other?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, as I
mentioned earlier,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.300 align:middle line:90%
serotonin is a big factor.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.469 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got low serotonin,
you can feel depressed,

00:12:18.469 --> 00:12:19.510 align:middle line:90%
and you can feel anxious.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And it's often
the anxiety that's

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.188 align:middle line:84%
in the head, where you've
got the ruminating thought.

00:12:23.188 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Then low gaba-- gaba's
another neurotransmitter,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.550 align:middle line:90%
gamma-Aminobutric acid.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.835 align:middle line:90%
It's also an amino acid.

00:12:28.835 --> 00:12:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And if your gaba
levels are low, you're

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:84%
going to feel stiff
and tense and anxious

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:84%
in your body, a physical
kind of anxiety.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And often people will have
a combination of both.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So we have to
figure out, if we're

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.520 align:middle line:84%
doing the supplements,
which supplement to use.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.330 align:middle line:84%
But certainly when
it comes to food,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.382 align:middle line:84%
eating protein is going to give
them all the amino acids, which

00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:47.840 align:middle line:84%
is going to start
to help them make

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.865 align:middle line:90%
their own neurotransmitters.

00:12:49.865 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's part
of the discussion

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.080 align:middle line:84%
some people are really
uncomfortable with.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, especially people who've
been trying to read the latest

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.740 align:middle line:84%
books on health and diet
and the latest trends.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they've
gone from carnivore

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:90%
to vegetarian to vegan to raw.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.684 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that seems to be a
pretty common progression

00:13:09.684 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:90%
that's happened.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:10.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And not
only are they not

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.140 align:middle line:84%
feeling better, but
maybe even worse.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And so now we talk
about proteins,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.320 align:middle line:90%
you mentioned a moment ago.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.820 align:middle line:84%
There are very specific proteins
and qualities of proteins

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.320 align:middle line:84%
that you see people
benefiting from.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.897 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:13:26.897 --> 00:13:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: I'm glad you
brought up this topic.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Because it is a touchy subject.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And when I was having all my
health problems and my anxiety,

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:90%
I was actually a vegetarian.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.501 align:middle line:90%
And it did not suit me.

00:13:37.501 --> 00:13:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I was eating a lot of soy,
which was not a good thing.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I was eating a lot of processed
soy, soy yogurt, soy cheese,

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.234 align:middle line:90%
you know, everything soy.

00:13:44.234 --> 00:13:45.150 align:middle line:90%
So that was a problem.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.566 align:middle line:84%
And soy is a common
food allergen.

00:13:46.566 --> 00:13:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But I just made the
decision that adding back

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.230 align:middle line:84%
in some protein was something
that I needed to do.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.790 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of my clients
find that when they've

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.830 align:middle line:84%
become vegetarians
they have issues.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:58.670 align:middle line:84%
When they start to add
the protein back in,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:90%
they start to feel better.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a big
proponent of red meat.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:90%
But the big thing is quality.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.049 align:middle line:84%
It needs to be good
quality, grass-fed red meat.

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:10.590 align:middle line:84%
And that makes a
world of difference.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.465 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: The
omega-3s are higher.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.855 align:middle line:90%
The omega-6s are lower.

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:84%
They've got all
these antioxidants.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:90%
It's got betacarotene.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's got all these
amazing amino acids,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.640 align:middle line:84%
which help to make
brain chemicals.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.590 align:middle line:84%
It's also got iron, which is
a cofactor in making the brain

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.510 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:27.760 align:middle line:90%
It's also got zinc.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: A cofactor?

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: A cofactor to help
make serotonin and gaba.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.249 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: It's got zinc, which
is so important for anxiety.

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:35.999 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:36.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Zinc and copper
balance each other out.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you've got very high
copper levels and low zinc

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.730 align:middle line:84%
levels, you're going
to feel more anxious.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.667 align:middle line:84%
And then if you take zinc or
you eat food that has zinc,

00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
then your copper's
going to come down.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
end up more balanced.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you're not
going to feel anxious.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.971 align:middle line:84%
And there is this social
anxiety condition,

00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:55.420 align:middle line:84%
which we'll probably talk
about later, called pyroluria.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And zinc is one of
the key nutrients.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:02.520 align:middle line:84%
So as well as making the brain
chemical serotonin and gaba

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.132 align:middle line:84%
and some of the others, it's
really, really important

00:15:05.132 --> 00:15:06.590 align:middle line:84%
for this pyroluria
condition, which

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.840 align:middle line:90%
is a social anxiety condition.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot of
research supporting

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:15.460 align:middle line:84%
this connection between
red meat and mood.

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.180 align:middle line:84%
There's actually some research
that came out of Australia,

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.740 align:middle line:84%
a number of papers
by a physician

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:90%
called Dr. Felice Jacka.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.970 align:middle line:84%
And she saw a correlation
between a whole foods

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
diet that included red meat
and a lower risk of anxiety

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and depression in women.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And the big thing is that the
study came out from Australia.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And the quality of
meat in Australia

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
is very different from
the quality of meat here.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.416 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:15:40.416 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So we know that
any papers coming out

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.450 align:middle line:84%
of Australia talking
about red meat,

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.270 align:middle line:84%
it's very likely to
be grass-fed red meat.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, I relate to
that completely because I

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:90%
was a vegetarian for 18 years.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, I really
threw myself into it.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And I had a television show
that aired throughout the United

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.720 align:middle line:84%
States, on every PBS station
but one-- New Orleans,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
not going to give up sausage--
and Australia, Canada.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
part of my identity

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:84%
was this whole
vegetarian way of life.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.390 align:middle line:84%
But what started happening
by about, I'd say,

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.410 align:middle line:84%
the 10th or 12th
year, I would salivate

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.910 align:middle line:84%
driving by a Sizzler steak
billboard on the highway.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I though something's
really wrong here.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, because
I was a vegetarian

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
for philosophical purposes,
which in my heart I still am,

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.780 align:middle line:90%
it was very difficult.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I allowed my health
to really decline

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.830 align:middle line:84%
before I would even
consider taking a bite.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I had this
interesting experience,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
where I was really
not feeling well.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But this time I
was feeling weak.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.660 align:middle line:90%
I had a meditation.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And it showed me a piece of
red meat and wine, red wine.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.820 align:middle line:90%
So I thought no, no, no.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:84%
I went to a doctor in
Sacramento, who was well known

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
at the time, because he
also was highly intuitive,

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:90%
a British gentleman, older man.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And first thing he says
is, well, what I'm hearing

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.050 align:middle line:84%
is you need to start
eating red meat.

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:05.089 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
And I cried all over
the first steak.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.210 align:middle line:90%
But I felt better immediately.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.374 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:17:10.374 --> 00:17:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, it was
hard psychologically.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
And I know there are
other people that

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.433 align:middle line:84%
might have to deal with
this or might choose to.

00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:18.849 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And they need to think
about how they're feeling.

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:20.224 align:middle line:84%
You know, I worked
with one woman

00:17:20.224 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
who worked with me a number
of years ago and was a vegan.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:84%
And I encouraged her to
at least add some eggs in.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
Because eggs are a
good source of protein.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.630 align:middle line:84%
She was not willing to do
the red meat or the chicken.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.147 align:middle line:84%
And she tried a
little bit, but wasn't

00:17:34.147 --> 00:17:35.480 align:middle line:90%
able to actually follow through.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.930 align:middle line:90%
And she stopped working with me.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.930 align:middle line:84%
Then I bumped into her
at a conference recently.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.039 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Trudy,
I feel so terrible.

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready to do
whatever you tell me.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you tell me
I need to do, I'll do.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.720 align:middle line:90%
She came to work with me.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And within a month, she
had added back eggs.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.085 align:middle line:84%
She had added back
some pastured chicken,

00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:53.460 align:middle line:84%
which is chicken that are
running around in the pastures.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.543 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes, free range.

00:17:54.543 --> 00:17:56.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And she was
feeling so much better.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
And then she went to a
conference, a vegan conference.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.710 align:middle line:90%
She stopped it all.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And now she's feeling
terrible again.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.827 align:middle line:84%
So she's just got to get to
the point that she's saying--

00:18:04.827 --> 00:18:05.910 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Psychologically.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: --I'm ready
to do this for myself.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.660 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: This is
a really big issue.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.590 align:middle line:84%
When we look at
priorities, we have

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.280 align:middle line:84%
our philosophical viewpoints,
our spiritual viewpoints.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But in the end,
what I came to is

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:20.490 align:middle line:84%
none of that is going
to be worth much

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:23.340 align:middle line:84%
if I'm no longer
occupying this body

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
because I have
allowed myself to fall

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.725 align:middle line:90%
into such a state of ill health.

00:18:26.725 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And so for me, the
decision became it's worth it.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.169 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it to go back.

00:18:32.169 --> 00:18:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean I don't have
compassion for the animals

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.320 align:middle line:90%
and have the same questions.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.028 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:18:36.028 --> 00:18:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And so this is big.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.106 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And then also, if
you are making a choice where

00:18:41.106 --> 00:18:43.730 align:middle line:84%
you know the farmer, or you know
where the food is coming from,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.500 align:middle line:84%
and you know that
it's grass-fed,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.502 align:middle line:84%
and the animals are
humanely treated,

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:90%
that makes a difference, too.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And that's not
hard to find anymore.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: No, it's not.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.336 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: You can find this.

00:18:52.336 --> 00:18:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And another element
of this is liver.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:90%
We talked about this off camera.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.395 align:middle line:90%
And I think, uh, liver.

00:18:59.395 --> 00:19:00.849 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I hated the
way mom made it.

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:02.140 align:middle line:90%
I can't stand the flavor of it.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.827 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, there are easy
ways to get liver into the diet.

00:19:05.827 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: And liver is wonderful.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.740 align:middle line:90%
It is so nutrient dense.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Again, quality's important.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So you do need to get it
from good quality animals.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But it is high in the B
vitamins, B12, for example.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.660 align:middle line:90%
And it's so nutrient dense.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:90%
Chicken livers are great.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:84%
In South Africa, a
standard starter option

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.819 align:middle line:84%
on a menu in a restaurant
is peri peri chicken livers,

00:19:27.819 --> 00:19:29.360 align:middle line:84%
which is like curried
chicken livers.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's something that
people eat regularly.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's healthy.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.735 align:middle line:84%
And then something like
a liverwurst is great.

00:19:35.735 --> 00:19:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, liverwurst.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.418 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you can even
go to Trader Joe's and get

00:19:39.418 --> 00:19:41.269 align:middle line:84%
a lovely chicken
and truffle pate.

00:19:41.269 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.476 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You know,
something like that.

00:19:43.476 --> 00:19:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So there are ways to start
getting those dense nutrients

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.882 align:middle line:84%
back in the body if you've
already crossed that border,

00:19:48.882 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:84%
and you're going into
the red meat world.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.770 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But also, let's talk
about fish, wild caught fish,

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.236 align:middle line:90%
and what that brings.

00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So it brings
all the omega-3s.

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It gives you protein as well, a
good source of vitamin D. A lot

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
of people with mood
problems have low vitamin D.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.150 align:middle line:84%
But again, quality's
important, wild fish.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Fish that is farmed
has been colored.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:84%
They've added colors
to the food to make

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.200 align:middle line:84%
this this nice
bright pink color.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.975 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Including the salmon?

00:20:11.975 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.670 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to be eating that.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.690 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: You know, the fish
farmer gets this little color

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.469 align:middle line:84%
wheel and says, which color
pink do I want my fish to be?

00:20:18.469 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:90%
And then you're ingesting that.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.569 align:middle line:84%
They're given
hormones, antibiotics.

00:20:21.569 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
And there's actually
research showing

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.230 align:middle line:84%
a connection between farmed
fish and an increased

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.630 align:middle line:90%
risk of diabetes.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So farmed fish is
not a good option.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.810 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be going
with the wild fish.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.260 align:middle line:90%
And the smaller fish is better.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
Coming from South Africa,
I'm a big fan of sardines.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.375 align:middle line:84%
Sardines contain
all the omega-3s.

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:40.540 align:middle line:84%
They're nice small fish, so
they don't have all the toxins.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And they're just delicious
and easy to take.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I'm on the road, I
take a few cans of sardines.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.869 align:middle line:84%
If I'm stuck in the
airport somewhere,

00:20:46.869 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I can open a can of
sardines and I've

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.782 align:middle line:90%
got a great source of protein.

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: That's a good idea.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And I take that
precaution even with tuna

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:84%
in that there is a particular
fisherman that I know

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
of in Oregon who goes out
and does his own catches.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And he's very specific
about the size and the age.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Because the older, of
course, the more toxins

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:90%
they've been ingesting.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And so, again,
this is available.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.330 align:middle line:84%
You can find consciously
raised almost everything.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you can tell
us right now, do you

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.520 align:middle line:84%
know a good website
in general for looking

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.510 align:middle line:90%
at how food is raised?

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.670 align:middle line:84%
Or should we just do our
own Google search on that?

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Weston A. Price--

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:21.181 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:21:21.181 --> 00:21:22.240 align:middle line:10%
Weston Price, fabulous.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: --is a good resource.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.441 align:middle line:10%
That's a good resource
for a lot of things.

00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:28.130 align:middle line:10%
So OK, Western A Price,
good place to go.

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:10%
What about gluten?

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to start going
through these food options.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.265 align:middle line:84%
Because gluten has turned
out to be a really big one

00:21:36.265 --> 00:21:37.385 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to mood.

00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: It really is.

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And people do not
realize how big it is.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
it's in the news,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and there's definitely more
awareness, and a lot of people

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.970 align:middle line:84%
are going gluten-free
is really great.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.011 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people aren't
making this connection

00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:49.790 align:middle line:90%
between mood and gluten.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:84%
And there's so much
research supporting people

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:56.120 align:middle line:84%
with celiac disease having
high rates of depression,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.261 align:middle line:84%
having more anxiety,
having more social anxiety.

00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:01.635 align:middle line:84%
There's even a link between
gluten and bipolar disorder--

00:22:01.635 --> 00:22:02.218 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:02.218 --> 00:22:03.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: --and gluten
and schizophrenia.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.200 align:middle line:84%
So with my clientele,
and obviously

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.010 align:middle line:84%
it's mostly women with anxiety
and depression, at least 80%

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.630 align:middle line:90%
do better on a gluten-free diet.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's way higher than
a lot of people realize.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.480 align:middle line:84%
The tricky thing is with
gluten, it's difficult to test.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Often people will
go to the doctor.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.140 align:middle line:90%
They'll have a celiac test done.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And the results
come back negative.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.149 align:middle line:84%
And that doctor will say
you can eat gluten again,

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
but when they actually do
the elimination-- which

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.730 align:middle line:84%
is what I have my clients
do, remove the gluten,

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.290 align:middle line:84%
see how they feel, and
then add it back in-- then

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.150 align:middle line:90%
they really feel the difference.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And the great thing is there's
a lot of research now coming out

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.830 align:middle line:84%
in the last year,
the last two years,

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.060 align:middle line:90%
supporting this connection.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
research up till now

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.830 align:middle line:84%
has talked about celiac disease
and these mood disorders.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.182 align:middle line:84%
But there is now
research showing

00:22:50.182 --> 00:22:52.265 align:middle line:84%
that there's this term
called gluten sensitivity--

00:22:52.265 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: --which I've
known about in my world

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.090 align:middle line:90%
for many, many years.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.390 align:middle line:84%
But it's now recognized
in the medical community

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.460 align:middle line:84%
as being a disease and that
we need to take it seriously,

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and that a lot of
the same symptoms

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that people have
with celiac disease,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
they might also have when
they've got gluten sensitivity.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And they may not show up
positive on celiac disease

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.170 align:middle line:90%
tests.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.211 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And there are
different kinds of tests.

00:23:13.211 --> 00:23:15.400 align:middle line:84%
You can also do saliva
tests over a 24 hour period.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And they'll give you a
certain result as well.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is
empirical evidence

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:90%
is better than any other.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.840 align:middle line:84%
If you take it away
and you feel better,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that counts more than all
the lab tests in the world.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Absolutely.

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.098 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But still, we give
our power away to these tests.

00:23:28.098 --> 00:23:30.030 align:middle line:84%
Say, well, maybe it
was some other factor.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.270 align:middle line:84%
And again, that's
something-- well,

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:84%
I just said it-- where we have
been giving our power away

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.299 align:middle line:84%
to the medical industry and
those tests for a long time.

00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yup.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.589 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And you're
saying don't do that.

00:23:39.589 --> 00:23:41.750 align:middle line:84%
You have to try and see
how your body's responding.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:44.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: I have all my
clients do this elimination

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.130 align:middle line:90%
and then challenge.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.274 align:middle line:90%
And we also do testing.

00:23:46.274 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes the testing
comes back positive,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.350 align:middle line:90%
sometimes it doesn't.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.890 align:middle line:84%
I just say, don't just
rely on the testing.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.420 align:middle line:84%
So remove the gluten for two
full weeks, no gluten at all.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.649 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage my clients
to eat real whole food

00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:90%
during that period.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't eat out at the restaurant.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.280 align:middle line:90%
Don't buy anything in a box.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:90%
Eat real whole food.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And then add it
back in on day 15.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And when it's been out of your
body for that length of time,

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.160 align:middle line:84%
and then you add it back in, you
can have all kind of reaction.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.450 align:middle line:84%
You can have a
total panic attack.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.500 align:middle line:90%
You could feel depressed.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.090 align:middle line:84%
You could feel wiped
out and exhausted.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.740 align:middle line:90%
You may have aches and pains.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.450 align:middle line:84%
For some people,
it's very profound.

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.690 align:middle line:84%
They notice it immediately
they take it out.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.190 align:middle line:84%
And they have a
very profound effect

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.040 align:middle line:90%
when they add it back in.

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some people don't
even want to add it back in.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Because they feel so
good when they're off of it.

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.720 align:middle line:84%
But then others,
it's more subtle.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when they add it back
in, they have this huge effect.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And then they know that they
really need to stay off it.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.280 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, now
what about the notion

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.280 align:middle line:90%
of grains in general.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Because now there's
also attention

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:43.760 align:middle line:84%
on more of a paleo diet,
which is a lot of vegetables

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and healthy meats, and
that sort of thing.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.920 align:middle line:10%
And the book "Wheat Belly,"
that William Davis wrote,

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.810 align:middle line:10%
he's saying that really
it's grains in general,

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.040 align:middle line:10%
we're overconsuming
grains in general.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not just that it's gluten.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.330 align:middle line:90%
What is your feeling on that?

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, going back
to what I said earlier

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.280 align:middle line:84%
about the whole
biochemical individuality,

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.790 align:middle line:84%
I work with four different
diets with my clients.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
And the first one
is gluten free.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.445 align:middle line:84%
So gluten, definitely
out of the picture.

00:25:09.445 --> 00:25:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And we want to see
if that's a problem.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.602 align:middle line:84%
The next aspect is gluten
free and dairy free.

00:25:13.602 --> 00:25:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Because often people
with gluten problems

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.450 align:middle line:84%
may have problems
with dairy as well.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
one is all grains.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the
paleo diet, where

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:84%
all grains, legumes, starchy
vegetables are removed.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.700 align:middle line:84%
And some people do really well
on that diet, maybe long term.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Some people, it's just
a short term thing.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Do you determine
that with them beforehand?

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Or do they go
through that process?

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: They go
through that process.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
As we're working
with them, as they--

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.513 align:middle line:90%
I have a six week program.

00:25:36.513 --> 00:25:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So as people are coming
in on a weekly basis,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.384 align:middle line:90%
we're checking in.

00:25:39.384 --> 00:25:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing how
they're responding,

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:42.300 align:middle line:90%
how much better they're doing.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll add more
elements to the program

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.247 align:middle line:90%
if we need to do that.

00:25:45.247 --> 00:25:47.121 align:middle line:84%
Some people, it's just
the removal of gluten,

00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:48.040 align:middle line:90%
and that's enough.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Others, we need to
do more if we're not

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.548 align:middle line:84%
getting the results
that we would expect.

00:25:51.548 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Though you're doing
this for mood disorders,

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.560 align:middle line:84%
is there often a
weight implication?

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.414 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Absolutely.

00:25:56.414 --> 00:25:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So oftentimes,
the weight just

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.500 align:middle line:84%
starts dropping
away once they hit

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.367 align:middle line:90%
on their ideal dietary program?

00:26:01.367 --> 00:26:02.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Yes, for a
number of reasons.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.780 align:middle line:10%
Firstly, if you're eating a
food that you're intolerant to,

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.795 align:middle line:10%
that's going to
cause inflammation.

00:26:06.795 --> 00:26:07.510 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:10.034 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: And inflammation will
make you hold onto weight.

00:26:10.034 --> 00:26:11.325 align:middle line:10%
It also stressed your adrenals.

00:26:11.325 --> 00:26:11.991 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:14.650 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: And having good adrenal
function is really important.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.150 align:middle line:10%
If you've got
stressed out adrenals,

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.420 align:middle line:10%
you're just going to
hold onto that weight.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:17.680 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So part of
the program is also

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
looking at people's
adrenal function

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and getting their
adrenals healed.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And everyone's got
burned out adrenals.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.880 align:middle line:90%
That's really key.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.175 align:middle line:10%
But let's talk about autism
and food for a moment.

00:26:28.175 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: You know, gluten can
affect any part of the body

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.910 align:middle line:10%
and can cause any
symptom, and just

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:34.451 align:middle line:10%
like what we were saying earlier
about this whole biochemical

00:26:34.451 --> 00:26:37.120 align:middle line:10%
individuality, someone may end
up with anxiety and depression,

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.734 align:middle line:10%
someone else may
end up with autism.

00:26:38.734 --> 00:26:40.650 align:middle line:84%
There are other factors
obviously with autism.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.670 align:middle line:90%
There's digestive issues.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.437 align:middle line:84%
And also, there's this tie
over with digestion with mood.

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.020 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.478 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: There's
also heavy metals,

00:26:47.478 --> 00:26:49.420 align:middle line:84%
which are often a big
component with autism.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:10%
And actually, before
I wrote my book,

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.860 align:middle line:10%
I did some research
with a nutritionist

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.512 align:middle line:10%
whose focus is
nutrition and autism.

00:26:56.512 --> 00:26:58.970 align:middle line:10%
And when I was helping her with
the research for her book--

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.690 align:middle line:10%
her book's called
"Nourishing Hope,"

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:10%
she's Julie Matthews--
we found so many overlaps

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:10%
between mental
health and autism,

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:10%
which is very fascinating.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So we can make
changes in one area

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:14.264 align:middle line:84%
and see ramifications in
many different diseases.

00:27:14.264 --> 00:27:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Interesting.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.600 align:middle line:84%
And this also, you
just mentioned.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
In digestive health, we're
talking another subject, leaky

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.550 align:middle line:90%
gut.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.609 align:middle line:84%
This is turning out to
be a serious issue when

00:27:23.609 --> 00:27:25.650 align:middle line:84%
it comes to all of these
different allergies that

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:84%
are popping up in
people's tests,

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.749 align:middle line:84%
where previously you
had no allergies.

00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:31.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're allergic to
everything, the whole spectrum,

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.160 align:middle line:84%
which is usually gluten, soy,
eggs, dairy, sometimes caffeine

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.880 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:90%
What is leaky gut?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:90%
And what's the problem here?

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:45.034 align:middle line:84%
And how can we start improving
that situation with diet?

00:27:45.034 --> 00:27:46.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So leaky
gut means you've

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:48.030 align:middle line:90%
got gaps in the gut lining.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And then proteins
from the food that you

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.300 align:middle line:84%
ingest get into
the blood system.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.259 align:middle line:84%
And the blood system
says, whoa, what's this?

00:27:53.259 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:90%
There's this foreign body here.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:90%
Let me create antibodies to it.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.482 align:middle line:84%
So often, when you do that
food intolerance testing,

00:27:58.482 --> 00:28:00.065 align:middle line:84%
you might see 30 or
40 different foods

00:28:00.065 --> 00:28:01.310 align:middle line:90%
that you have an issue with.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.976 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:01.976 --> 00:28:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And it may
be a temporary thing,

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.190 align:middle line:90%
until you heal the gut.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:middle line:84%
So the solution is is
to remove the foods that

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.690 align:middle line:84%
are causing the problem
and do some things that

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
start to heal the gut,
like vitamin C, aloe vera,

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.530 align:middle line:84%
glutamine, which is fabulous
for healing the gut.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.071 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:28:15.071 --> 00:28:16.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm writing these down.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And then
when you heal the gut,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.030 align:middle line:84%
then you can slowly
but surely start

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.617 align:middle line:90%
to reintroduce some foods.

00:28:21.617 --> 00:28:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned the
common food allergens.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
So those you would want
to obviously add in later.

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:27.610 align:middle line:84%
But if someone's
showing that they've

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.167 align:middle line:84%
got an issue with green
beans and peas and salmon,

00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:33.250 align:middle line:84%
you would probably think,
well, that maybe is just

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.560 align:middle line:90%
because of the leaky gut.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.367 align:middle line:84%
Those are not common
food allergens.

00:28:36.367 --> 00:28:38.700 align:middle line:84%
Then they add them back in,
and they see how they react.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:39.366 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:28:39.366 --> 00:28:42.100 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine,
Udo Erasmus, wrote

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.030 align:middle line:84%
the book, "Fats That
Heal, Fats That Kill."

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And I remember his
saying in the book

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:52.260 align:middle line:84%
that leaky gut was very
strongly impacted by the intake

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.847 align:middle line:84%
of the proper essential fatty
acids, such as omega-3 as well.

00:28:56.847 --> 00:28:57.430 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to have
good omega-3s that

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.330 align:middle line:84%
are going to coat the lining,
protect the digestive system,

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.960 align:middle line:84%
and also help the integrity
of the cell lining,

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.971 align:middle line:84%
so you're not going
to have that problem.

00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
The other things that actually
contribute to leaky gut

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
is possibly genetically
modified food,

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.010 align:middle line:84%
stress is a huge factor,
environmental toxins.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.030 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are
onslaughts on the body

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:22.440 align:middle line:90%
and are going to cause problems.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But the biggest thing
that I find is gluten.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.059 align:middle line:84%
If someone has a gluten
issue, it's damaging the gut.

00:29:27.059 --> 00:29:29.600 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It's going to simulate
that condition of leaky gut.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:29.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.110 align:middle line:90%
It's going to damage the gut.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.070 align:middle line:84%
It's going to affect
nutrient absorption.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.390 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cause these
other food intolerances.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.470 align:middle line:84%
So removing that, addressing
the other food intolerances,

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.494 align:middle line:84%
and then slowly but
surely adding them back,

00:29:41.494 --> 00:29:43.910 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people can then start
to eat a normal diet again.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.500 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So is it fair
to say that if you're

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.332 align:middle line:84%
over the age of 30
or even 40, you've

00:29:48.332 --> 00:29:49.790 align:middle line:84%
been on the planet
and eating foods

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:52.114 align:middle line:84%
and exposed to a lot
of toxins for a while,

00:29:52.114 --> 00:29:54.530 align:middle line:84%
and you're starting to find
that you're suddenly sensitive

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.720 align:middle line:84%
to or allergic to a whole array
of things, leaky gut is likely

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.470 align:middle line:90%
at the base of it?

00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Very possibly.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's actually in
the scientific research now,

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:90%
leaky gut.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:03.900 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:05.691 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Whereas, 10
years ago in my world,

00:30:05.691 --> 00:30:07.250 align:middle line:90%
we'd use the term leaky gut.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.631 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's
research saying,

00:30:08.631 --> 00:30:10.380 align:middle line:84%
yes, there is this
thing called leaky gut.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Makes perfect sense.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So it's really exciting
that the medical community

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.620 align:middle line:90%
is embracing this.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.460 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Yeah, it
does make sense.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.150 align:middle line:84%
If you have all this stuff
leaking into your system,

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.610 align:middle line:84%
you're going to create
antibodies for it.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.580 align:middle line:84%
That should tell you
right there on that panel.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:19.920 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.130 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right?

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Interesting.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.460 align:middle line:90%
So we had to address that.

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, before we go into chocolate,
what about low stomach acid?

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:31.640 align:middle line:84%
How does that affect our
ability to digest the food

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.537 align:middle line:90%
or assimilate the food?

00:30:33.537 --> 00:30:35.370 align:middle line:84%
Even if you are eating
all the right things,

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have the proper
amount of stomach acid,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.890 align:middle line:90%
what does that mean?

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:39.890 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Great question.

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.915 align:middle line:84%
Because we need
good enzymes to be

00:30:41.915 --> 00:30:44.570 align:middle line:84%
able to get the benefits
of the nutrients

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:46.469 align:middle line:84%
from these wonderful
foods that we're eating.

00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:48.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, we can be eating
the best foods in the world,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.255 align:middle line:84%
but if we're not
digesting them, we're

00:30:50.255 --> 00:30:51.504 align:middle line:90%
not going to get the benefits.

00:30:51.504 --> 00:30:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And hydrochloric
acid or stomach acid

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.970 align:middle line:84%
is one particular thing that
helps us to digest food.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.260 align:middle line:84%
Actually, hydrochloric
acid or stomach acid

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.144 align:middle line:90%
is used to break down protein.

00:31:03.144 --> 00:31:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So if we're going to eat this
beautiful grass-fed red meat

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.930 align:middle line:84%
or this lovely wild fish, we
need the hydrochloric acid

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:09.970 align:middle line:90%
or the stomach acid.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And that actually breaks down
the protein into amino acids.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.060 align:middle line:84%
It helps us get
access to iron, zinc,

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.804 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
wonderful nutrients.

00:31:19.804 --> 00:31:21.470 align:middle line:84%
And we've found that
in a lot of people,

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.727 align:middle line:84%
the hydrochloric acid production
actually goes down as they age.

00:31:24.727 --> 00:31:25.310 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.393 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So they may need
a little bit of support,

00:31:27.393 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:84%
adding in a leafy green
vegetable just before a meal,

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.970 align:middle line:84%
like an arugula or something
bitter that can actually

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:84%
stimulate your hydrochloric
acid production,

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
or having something like apple
cider vinegar, a little bit

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.680 align:middle line:84%
in a glass of water
before a meal,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.025 align:middle line:84%
can actually stimulate your
own stomach acid production.

00:31:43.025 --> 00:31:43.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: What about
something simple

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:84%
like over-the-counter
supplements

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.107 align:middle line:90%
like papaya enzymes.

00:31:48.107 --> 00:31:49.440 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: So those are different.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Those are great.

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Those are
general enzymes

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.330 align:middle line:84%
that'll help us break
down other foods.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:53.540 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, right.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not a hydrochloric acid.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.515 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:31:54.515 --> 00:31:55.056 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:31:55.056 --> 00:31:56.605 align:middle line:90%
But we often need those as well.

00:31:56.605 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So I'll often have people, if
they've got digestive issues,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:84%
add in a general
enzyme that contains

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:07.170 align:middle line:84%
some of the papain
and the bromelain

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:84%
and some of those
other enzymes together

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.310 align:middle line:90%
with the hydrochloric acid.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:13.710 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll monitor
their stool and their bowel

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:14.220 align:middle line:90%
movements.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.344 align:middle line:90%
And we'll see improvements.

00:32:15.344 --> 00:32:17.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we know we're
on to the right thing.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.420 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: If the
apple cider vinegar

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.205 align:middle line:84%
and the arugula and
astringent leafy greens

00:32:22.205 --> 00:32:23.580 align:middle line:84%
aren't doing the
trick, are there

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.222 align:middle line:84%
any other hydrochloric
acid type of supplements?

00:32:26.222 --> 00:32:29.482 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: You can take straight
hydrochloric acid supplement.

00:32:29.482 --> 00:32:30.940 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Is that
over-the-counter?

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:31.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Over-the-counter.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:31.930 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:34.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And the way to do it is
to start off with one per meal

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.920 align:middle line:90%
and build up to five per meal.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And when you get that
sort of burning sensation

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.846 align:middle line:84%
in the sort of stomach here,
like a hot potato feeling,

00:32:41.846 --> 00:32:43.220 align:middle line:84%
that means you've
taken too many.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.178 align:middle line:90%
And then you back down.

00:32:44.178 --> 00:32:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So say you got to
two or three per meal

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and you got that warm sensation,
then you back down to two.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:90%
And then you take two per meal.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to be your
level of hydrochloric acid

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.684 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:32:54.684 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you'll
start to make your own.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And then you can back down even
further, and maybe even stop.

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:00.780 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You will
start to make your own?

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.946 align:middle line:90%
So this is not irreversible.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:04.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily a
natural process of aging.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:04.799 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:05.340 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.590 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: The other thing is
we need salt in our diets.

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.240 align:middle line:84%
We need salt to make
hydrochloric acid.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are going on
completely low salt or no salt

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.100 align:middle line:90%
diets.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.490 align:middle line:90%
We need quality salt.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.987 align:middle line:84%
So it needs to be
Celtic salt or sea salt.

00:33:16.987 --> 00:33:18.070 align:middle line:90%
And it's got the minerals.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's a good source of
salt without all the added

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.120 align:middle line:84%
things that we
don't really want.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.185 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: How about the
pink Himalayan salt?

00:33:23.185 --> 00:33:23.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Perfect, love it.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, I like that one.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:26.916 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I just ordered
a couple pounds of it.

00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:27.541 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Great.

00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I like
that in my food.

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.308 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going on to
one that a lot of people

00:33:31.308 --> 00:33:32.870 align:middle line:84%
have attachment
issues regarding.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.690 align:middle line:90%
We're talking about chocolate.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
And when we talked off camera,
Jay, who's in the studio here,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.359 align:middle line:84%
said please don't
tell me you're going

00:33:41.359 --> 00:33:42.650 align:middle line:90%
to say chocolate's on the list.

00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:84%
But the good thing
is Jay doesn't

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:44.790 align:middle line:90%
have any mood disorders.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.724 align:middle line:84%
So again, we have to
keep this specific.

00:33:46.724 --> 00:33:48.140 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
a mood disorder,

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.620 align:middle line:84%
this isn't the conversation
that you have to worry about.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you do, let's talk about
the effects of theobromine

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and chocolate with the caffeine
and everything else in it.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.120 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Chocolate
does make us feel good.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, we know
it affects our mood.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.640 align:middle line:84%
We know it gives us
this comfort feeling.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.533 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women really
love chocolate.

00:34:06.533 --> 00:34:08.199 align:middle line:84%
And every time I go
into a presentation,

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.699 align:middle line:84%
someone will come to me at the
beginning of the presentation

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:13.194 align:middle line:84%
and say, we are going to talk
about chocolate, aren't we?

00:34:13.194 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a
really hot topic.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Thinking, yes.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:15.481 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:34:15.481 --> 00:34:17.830 align:middle line:84%
Are you sure it's OK
or if it's not OK?

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.409 align:middle line:84%
And they often know that
it is an issue for them.

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:23.989 align:middle line:84%
But the issue with the chocolate
is the high sugar content,

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:27.019 align:middle line:84%
which if it's white
chocolate or milk chocolate,

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:27.929 align:middle line:90%
it's high sugar.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.659 align:middle line:90%
Caffeine is a big factor.

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:31.639 align:middle line:84%
And for some people
with anxiety,

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:35.424 align:middle line:84%
the effects of the caffeine in
chocolate can just be too much.

00:34:35.424 --> 00:34:37.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's a lot
of research supporting

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.989 align:middle line:84%
that it's beneficial
for heart disease.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:40.889 align:middle line:84%
It helps lower high
blood pressure.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:43.260 align:middle line:90%
It helps with lipids.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.870 align:middle line:84%
So there are some good
benefits with chocolate.

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:47.920 align:middle line:90%
The problem is three things.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Quality, again,
is very important.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Cocoa beans are
very highly sprayed.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.130 align:middle line:84%
So it definitely does
need to be organic.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:55.862 align:middle line:84%
And then the darker
chocolate is better.

00:34:55.862 --> 00:34:58.320 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the darker
chocolate, it's got less sugar,

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.330 align:middle line:90%
but's got more caffeine.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:34:59.850 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: More caffeine, yeah.

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So that's
an issue, too.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And the final thing is can you
have one piece or two pieces?

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Or do you need to
demolish the whole slab

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
and you're using it
for emotional reasons?

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.160 align:middle line:90%
Is it a comfort thing?

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.210 align:middle line:90%
Is it giving you energy?

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you need it at
the end of the day

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:17.160 align:middle line:90%
to give you that mood boost?

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're using it
like a drug, it's

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:21.220 align:middle line:84%
your drug of choice
to make you feel good,

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.910 align:middle line:84%
then you need to address where
the biochemical imbalance is

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:24.969 align:middle line:90%
and then address that.

00:35:24.969 --> 00:35:26.510 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And
otherwise, if you don't

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.029 align:middle line:84%
have mood disorders,
moderation's fine on chocolate.

00:35:29.029 --> 00:35:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:30.945 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So that's
the good news

00:35:30.945 --> 00:35:33.700 align:middle line:84%
for people who are not suffering
from anxiety or depression.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Let's
talk about coffee.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, that might even be more
of a sacred cow for most people

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.080 align:middle line:90%
than chocolate.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.415 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: It is.

00:35:40.415 --> 00:35:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I mean, because that's
the ritual to start the day.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.895 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: It is.

00:35:42.895 --> 00:35:44.900 align:middle line:84%
And that is the thing
that most of my clients

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.380 align:middle line:90%
have the biggest issue with.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:90%
They'll give up sodas.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.040 align:middle line:90%
They'll even give up chocolate.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.840 align:middle line:90%
They'll add in red meat.

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.260 align:middle line:84%
They'll do all
these other things.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.330 align:middle line:84%
They're willing to give
up cookies and bread.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:57.850 align:middle line:84%
But the coffee is something
they really hold on to.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.500 align:middle line:90%
As you said, it's this ritual.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.300 align:middle line:84%
I had one of my
clients say, it's

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.820 align:middle line:90%
my quite time in the morning.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.582 align:middle line:84%
When there's no one else
around, I make my cup of coffee.

00:36:05.582 --> 00:36:07.290 align:middle line:84%
And I sit there, and
I watch the sunrise.

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.540 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting my books done.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.010 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting things done.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you take that away from
me, what am I going to have?

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.170 align:middle line:84%
The problem is with coffee,
again, is the caffeine.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's research showing--
there's one study that actually

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:21.990 align:middle line:84%
showed a group of women who had
anxiety that hadn't benefited

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:25.117 align:middle line:84%
from medication, they hadn't
benefited from therapy.

00:36:25.117 --> 00:36:26.700 align:middle line:84%
They were only
drinking one and a half

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.330 align:middle line:90%
to three cups of coffee a day.

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:31.140 align:middle line:84%
They took the coffee
out, anxiety was gone.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.550 align:middle line:90%
So it really is worth doing.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.490 align:middle line:84%
Before you think about
adding in supplements

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:37.035 align:middle line:84%
of doing all this testing,
just think about getting off

00:36:37.035 --> 00:36:38.970 align:middle line:90%
the coffee and see how you feel.

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, we can't just yank the
coffee away for a lot of people

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.730 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of
people are using coffee

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:44.600 align:middle line:90%
to give them energy.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.500 align:middle line:84%
They may not be
getting enough sleep.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.820 align:middle line:90%
They may have adrenal fatigue.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.277 align:middle line:90%
They may have thyroid problems.

00:36:49.277 --> 00:36:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And they're using that
coffee to give them energy.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.840 align:middle line:84%
So if they take that coffee
away and they can't function,

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.030 align:middle line:90%
then that's no good.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So we need to take a
look at the underlying

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.280 align:middle line:84%
reason of why they
drink the coffee.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.430 align:middle line:84%
The great thing is all my
clients who have eventually

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.570 align:middle line:84%
gone caffeine-free
say, I can't believe

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I fought you so much on this.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:09.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not that bad.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.852 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling great without it.

00:37:10.852 --> 00:37:12.810 align:middle line:84%
And I can't believe I
made such an issue of it.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.750 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But what about some
of the coffee substitutes?

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the woman-- I've
forgotten her name right

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:21.500 align:middle line:84%
off hand-- who started
Teeccino, who was formerly

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.880 align:middle line:84%
one of the formulators for
Celestial Seasonings started

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Teeccino, which is
chicory-based and so forth.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.130 align:middle line:84%
And it does have a
coffee flavor to it.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.560 align:middle line:84%
It's different, but it doesn't
have the caffeine for one.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.450 align:middle line:84%
And it still has that
full bodied flavor.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not
advertising Teeccino.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.050 align:middle line:84%
There are other
companies as well.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:38.859 align:middle line:90%
What about those?

00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:39.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Those are great.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:90%
Some of them do contain barley.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to be aware
if gluten is an issue.

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.335 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Then you're
into the gluten issue.

00:37:45.335 --> 00:37:45.876 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:47.390 align:middle line:84%
But one of my
favorites is actually

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Dandy Blend, which is
made with dandelions.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.297 align:middle line:84%
And it's got this
rich bodied flavor

00:37:53.297 --> 00:37:54.380 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.610 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Does it
taste like coffee?

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: It tastes like warm--
I'm not a coffee drinker.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'd hate to say that
it tastes like coffee.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:37:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yeah.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: But my
clients enjoy it.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And I have a little
sample in my office.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:02.900 align:middle line:10%
And I give them a sample to try.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.358 align:middle line:10%
>>REGINA: What is
it called Dandy--

00:38:04.358 --> 00:38:05.350 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: Dandy Blend.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's made from
dandelions, and dandelions

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.950 align:middle line:90%
are supportive of the liver.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting that
coffee kind of taste.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, interesting.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Because the caffeine is
actually damaging on the liver.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.355 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:38:14.355 --> 00:38:14.938 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:38:14.938 --> 00:38:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of women with
hormonal issues and men

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:18.220 align:middle line:90%
need liver support.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.940 align:middle line:84%
You support the liver, and that
helps with hormonal imbalance.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.992 align:middle line:84%
So getting that liver
support is fabulous.

00:38:23.992 --> 00:38:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And let me give you one more
other drink instead of coffee.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.840 align:middle line:90%
Carob is one of my favorites.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Oh, yes.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.165 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Carob in hot water with
a little bit of coconut milk

00:38:32.165 --> 00:38:34.810 align:middle line:84%
or fresh cream with a little
bit of cinnamon in it.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.289 align:middle line:90%
And it's just delicious.

00:38:36.289 --> 00:38:36.830 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.330 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll try that one.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.129 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: OK, good.

00:38:39.129 --> 00:38:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: You were talking
about adrenal burnout.

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.840 align:middle line:84%
And we were talking
about coffee, caffeine.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.140 align:middle line:84%
That also gets into
the weight gain issue.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.130 align:middle line:84%
I noticed that of all
the diets out there,

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.280 align:middle line:84%
the myriad number of diets,
almost all of them have people,

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.510 align:middle line:84%
for weight loss,
almost all of them

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.130 align:middle line:84%
have them give up
coffee or caffeine.

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:56.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's research
showing that it

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:90%
affects cortisol levels.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.650 align:middle line:90%
It affects testosterone levels.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.400 align:middle line:90%
It affects your estrogen levels.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So it does effect different
parts of the body.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:09.030 align:middle line:84%
We know from research that it
does deplete us of nutrients.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.010 align:middle line:90%
It's very dehydrating as well.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.287 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of
elements as to why

00:39:13.287 --> 00:39:14.620 align:middle line:90%
we might want to give up coffee.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And I even say to those clients
who do not have anxiety,

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.820 align:middle line:84%
I challenge you to give up
coffee and see how you feel.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if you remove it
and now you can't function,

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.240 align:middle line:84%
then that's a clue
that there's something

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.100 align:middle line:84%
underlying that you
need to address.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:31.920 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah, OK.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So even the
people who aren't anxious,

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.855 align:middle line:90%
you need to think about.

00:39:34.855 --> 00:39:35.480 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yeah.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, and also I
can't help but think

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.580 align:middle line:84%
it's because like gluten
and everything else,

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the processed foods
that have gluten in them

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.490 align:middle line:84%
have percentages
up to 20%, 30%, 40%

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.740 align:middle line:84%
gluten in some of these
very refined baked goods.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Versus, natural hard wheats and
such of earlier times and that

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.040 align:middle line:84%
still exist, heirloom
wheats and grains,

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.642 align:middle line:90%
which have maybe 2% naturally.

00:39:56.642 --> 00:39:57.475 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Aboslutely.

00:39:57.475 --> 00:39:59.058 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But they
throw the gluten in

00:39:59.058 --> 00:40:00.830 align:middle line:84%
to make this light
fluffy texture.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.535 align:middle line:84%
So we've been over
consuming gluten

00:40:02.535 --> 00:40:03.993 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
we can certainly

00:40:03.993 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:84%
understand on that, for example,
why we've become intolerant.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:09.130 align:middle line:84%
But what about
coffee, when you go

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.410 align:middle line:84%
in for a venti in
the morning, versus

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:15.300 align:middle line:84%
when you're in Eastern
Europe, or when

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.462 align:middle line:84%
you're in any of the Arabian
countries, any of the--

00:40:19.462 --> 00:40:20.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Yeah, a
tiny little thing.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.753 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --Middle
Eastern countries, you're

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:24.439 align:middle line:84%
having this much
in a cup that big.

00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:25.480 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: And it's black--

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: And it's black.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: --without sugar.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.190 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Maybe a little
cardamom in there--

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes, exactly.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.270 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --in some of
the Arab traditions.

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.269 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So you'll see a
lot of research showing

00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:34.180 align:middle line:90%
benefits of coffee.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And the latest research
seems to support black coffee

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.410 align:middle line:90%
with no sugar, no creamer.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.780 align:middle line:84%
The other thing with
coffee, also coffee beans

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.980 align:middle line:84%
are highly sprayed, very,
very highly sprayed.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.950 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So the organic thing
is really really important.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So it
should be organic.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.227 align:middle line:84%
And it should be in a ceramic
mug not a plastic mug.

00:40:50.227 --> 00:40:52.476 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you're
getting all the plastics out

00:40:52.476 --> 00:40:54.210 align:middle line:84%
of the mug, out of
the plastic mug.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:55.626 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: One of
the things I did,

00:40:55.626 --> 00:40:58.540 align:middle line:84%
I bought one of those little
stove top Italian espresso

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.070 align:middle line:90%
makers.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:40:59.861 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Excellent.

00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So it
forces the steam up.

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.435 align:middle line:84%
So it's a tabletop version of
what you get in the stores.

00:41:05.435 --> 00:41:06.060 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Great.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But again,
just a tiny little bit

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.615 align:middle line:84%
like that, it's almost like
a homeopathic dose of coffee.

00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It actually feels pretty
good without the same kind

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.320 align:middle line:84%
of reactions as having, say, a
latte or something like that.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.012 align:middle line:84%
So then, again,
you're talking dairy,

00:41:19.012 --> 00:41:20.720 align:middle line:84%
when you start throwing
all the dairy in.

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Or soy.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are adding
soy to their lattes.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.370 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Right.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:24.995 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And that
can be a whole issue.

00:41:24.995 --> 00:41:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, any soy that
is consumed definitely

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.570 align:middle line:90%
needs to be organic.

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.620 align:middle line:84%
Because if it's not,
we can be assured

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:32.050 align:middle line:90%
it is genetically modified.

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.960 align:middle line:84%
Because 90% of the soy in
this country that is not

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.294 align:middle line:90%
organic is genetically modified.

00:41:36.294 --> 00:41:38.543 align:middle line:84%
And we really don't want to
be adding that to the mix.

00:41:38.543 --> 00:41:39.100 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: No.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.822 align:middle line:90%
And what about dairy?

00:41:40.822 --> 00:41:41.980 align:middle line:90%
How does diary factor in?

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.462 align:middle line:90%
Is that part of the profile?

00:41:43.462 --> 00:41:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, some people
have a problem with dairy.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And it might be a
short term thing

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.380 align:middle line:84%
while they're healing the gut
if they've got a gluten issue.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
different forms of dairy.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Some people can
tolerate cow's milk.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Some will do better on
sheep's milk or goat's milk.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Some will do better with
yogurt or fermented dairy.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.290 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:59.550 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So it
really is a matter

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.450 align:middle line:90%
of figuring out what works.

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:02.033 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: But that's
not as big a part

00:42:02.033 --> 00:42:03.837 align:middle line:84%
of this story as
the chocolate, which

00:42:03.837 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:84%
has the caffeine, and then the
coffee, which has the caffeine.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And now we go to
the big one, sugar.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.220 align:middle line:90%
Sugar.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.310 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: So sugar is toxic.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:14.100 align:middle line:84%
And there was a paper published
last year in "Nature,"

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.210 align:middle line:90%
by Robert Lustig.

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And he said sugar
is toxic, and it

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.950 align:middle line:84%
should be banned and controlled
like tobacco and alcohol.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.529 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Instead, when you
check out at the grocery store,

00:42:23.529 --> 00:42:24.070 align:middle line:90%
there it is--

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: It's right there.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.506 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: --with all of
it's pretty little packaging

00:42:26.506 --> 00:42:28.267 align:middle line:90%
and colors, beckoning us.

00:42:28.267 --> 00:42:28.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.530 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, I disagree.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.940 align:middle line:84%
I totally with part
of that statement.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.190 align:middle line:84%
I totally agree with
that it is toxic.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:36.250 align:middle line:90%
It really is toxic.

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.350 align:middle line:84%
We should not have any
added sugar in our diets.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.790 align:middle line:84%
The desire for something sweet
should be satisfied by fruit.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So I agree with that
part, the toxic part.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.800 align:middle line:84%
What I don't agree
with is that it

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.690 align:middle line:90%
should be banned and controlled.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Because we
self-medicate with sugar

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:55.850 align:middle line:84%
like we self-medicate with
coffee and with other treats.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we yank it away
and we control it,

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.050 align:middle line:84%
people are going
to feel deprived.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:01.591 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
feel more depressed.

00:43:01.591 --> 00:43:04.220 align:middle line:84%
What we need to do is
balance brain chemistry.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.400 align:middle line:84%
If we address
nutritional deficiencies,

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.580 align:middle line:84%
we balance brain chemistry, we
address these neurotransmitter

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:12.470 align:middle line:84%
imbalances, then the desire
for sugar just goes away.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:13.990 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes a non-issue.

00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:15.830 align:middle line:90%
There's no will power required.

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.181 align:middle line:90%
And people don't feel deprived.

00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:18.180 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we want.

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:20.200 align:middle line:90%
We want balance.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:21.700 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Are you
saying all sugars?

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Or what about, say, a
raw honey, for example,

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.070 align:middle line:84%
a regional raw honey, which
does have other nutrients in it.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.903 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Absolutely.

00:43:27.903 --> 00:43:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Stevia and xylitol do not
affect blood sugar levels.

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.640 align:middle line:84%
So those are OK in
the transition period.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But it's just when
we're replacing sugar

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:41.010 align:middle line:84%
with equal amounts of honey
or sugar with agave nectar--

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and agave nectars
are not a good thing.

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:84%
It used to be considered
a healthy sweetener.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.960 align:middle line:84%
There's no such thing as a
healthy sweetener really.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.400 align:middle line:84%
But agave nectar, people are
using it in large quantities.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.442 align:middle line:90%
And it's still sugar.

00:43:52.442 --> 00:43:53.400 align:middle line:90%
It's actually fructose.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And there's research showing
that fructose and heart

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:90%
disease are definitely related.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.520 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's
throw in the subject

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of other natural sources like
raisins, dates, and dried

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.210 align:middle line:90%
fruits.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.796 align:middle line:84%
How do those affect us in
terms of mood disorder?

00:44:08.796 --> 00:44:10.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So those are great
because fruits is good.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But keep in mind you would
eat way more raisins than you

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.550 align:middle line:90%
would eat in a bunch of grapes.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.060 align:middle line:84%
So the problem is you may
eat a whole bag, which

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.360 align:middle line:90%
is going to be way more.

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So dried fruit in
moderation because you

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.320 align:middle line:84%
can tend to eat more
of it, and it is higher

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.245 align:middle line:90%
concentration of sugars.

00:44:27.245 --> 00:44:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Sure.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.203 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: But it's a great snack.

00:44:29.203 --> 00:44:31.292 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is with
sugar is to have something

00:44:31.292 --> 00:44:33.500 align:middle line:84%
with the sugar so you're
not getting that sugar high.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.320 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Well, like, if you
had dates and nuts together,

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:35.870 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:36.260 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: That would
be a nice-- yeah.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.200 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: A handful of nuts
and some dates would be great.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:40.890 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.427 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're going to get
to the really juicy part

00:44:43.427 --> 00:44:45.260 align:middle line:84%
of the conversation as
far as I'm concerned.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.926 align:middle line:84%
And that has to do
with the amino acids.

00:44:46.926 --> 00:44:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Because you and the
work you've done

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.590 align:middle line:84%
with people has been
really pretty extraordinary

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.820 align:middle line:90%
in some of the results.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.540 align:middle line:90%
So we have about 10 minutes.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.110 align:middle line:84%
We can really dive
into it a bit.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:56.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: OK.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So let's talk
about the amino acids

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.690 align:middle line:84%
that are, for example,
implicated in our sugar

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.990 align:middle line:84%
cravings, since we're
following that subject.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: OK.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I use five different amino
acids in my practice.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And we determine
which one to use

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.470 align:middle line:90%
based on the person's symptoms.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.261 align:middle line:84%
So I'll have people do
these questionnaires

00:45:14.261 --> 00:45:15.930 align:middle line:90%
where we'll look at serotonin.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.830 align:middle line:84%
We'll look at the
catecholamines.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:18.770 align:middle line:90%
We'll look at gaba.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:20.020 align:middle line:90%
We'll look at the endorphins.

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.270 align:middle line:90%
And we'll look at blood sugar.

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And depending on how they
score on their symptoms,

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.285 align:middle line:84%
we'll then decide which
amino acid to use.

00:45:25.285 --> 00:45:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'll use them in
the office with someone.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So say you, my
client, you score high

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:31.550 align:middle line:90%
in the low serotonin section.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.990 align:middle line:84%
So you're depressed,
like a 10 out of 10.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.600 align:middle line:84%
You've got sleep
problems, 9 out of 10.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.620 align:middle line:84%
You've got anxiety and
worry, like 8 out of 10.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And you've got these afternoon
and evening cravings.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:45.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the clue for
the low serotonin.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:46.650 align:middle line:90%
You may have irritability.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:90%
You may have anger issues.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:48.900 align:middle line:90%
You may have PMS.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.600 align:middle line:84%
These are all signs
of low serotonin.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.330 align:middle line:90%
So you score high in that area.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:55.050 align:middle line:84%
So we think, OK, we want to
have you try the tryptophan.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.380 align:middle line:84%
This is the main amino acid
that I use for low serotonin.

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And so I will say to you, how
are you feeling right now?

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:03.530 align:middle line:90%
How's your anxiety level?

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:05.590 align:middle line:90%
And you'll say it's like a 10.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And I've got this
worry in my head.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.176 align:middle line:84%
I can't stop thinking about
this thing that went on at work.

00:46:10.176 --> 00:46:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I'm feeling
pretty depressed.

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But I'm getting a
little bit optimistic,

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.163 align:middle line:90%
because I'm here talking to you.

00:46:14.163 --> 00:46:17.130 align:middle line:84%
But my depression's, not
at 10, it's like an 8.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's afternoon,
how are your cravings?

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:22.060 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I just really want
something sweet now.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:24.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'll say, well, let's
have you try tryptophan.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.580 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you the tryptophan.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:27.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's sublingual.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:30.300 align:middle line:90%
So you will just chew it.

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.362 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we do
the chewing is then it

00:46:32.362 --> 00:46:34.570 align:middle line:84%
gets in through the blood
vessels and into your brain

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:35.070 align:middle line:90%
quickly.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And we can get a
result very quickly.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.232 align:middle line:84%
And then I will ask you
in five minutes time,

00:46:39.232 --> 00:46:40.190 align:middle line:90%
so how are you feeling?

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.194 align:middle line:90%
How's that worry feeling?

00:46:42.194 --> 00:46:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Hm, it's gone from an eight
to a nine to like a five.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I feel relaxed.

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I feel more optimistic.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.630 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I feel happier.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And I say, what
about the craving?

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I hadn't even
thought about it.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.109 align:middle line:90%
And it works that quickly.

00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So the wonderful thing
with the amino acids

00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.100 align:middle line:84%
is they work so
quickly that you will

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.980 align:middle line:84%
know if they're going
to have an effect.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.535 align:middle line:84%
If you don't notice
anything, it may

00:47:03.535 --> 00:47:05.420 align:middle line:84%
be that you didn't
have quite enough.

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.040 align:middle line:84%
Or it may be that
you don't need it.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't need it, then
we move on to something else.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And then I do the same with
all the different sections.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Low gaba would be
stiff and tense muscles

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and feeling sort of
physically tense.

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have someone try
the gaba and see the results.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, I had one little
girl come in the office.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.520 align:middle line:84%
She had bad anger issues,
bad sleep problems,

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.220 align:middle line:84%
very depressed, and
very big sugar cravings.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.270 align:middle line:84%
She loved the candies, all
the brightly colored candies.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:34.860 align:middle line:90%
And she came into the office.

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.392 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
have a lot of money.

00:47:36.392 --> 00:47:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to pick
three or four things

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that I knew were really going
to possibly get us some results.

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:43.230 align:middle line:90%
I had blood work done.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:44.455 align:middle line:90%
She had low iron.

00:47:44.455 --> 00:47:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And it turned out that
she had gluten issues.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.450 align:middle line:90%
So we got her off gluten.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.130 align:middle line:90%
And that made a big difference.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:50.850 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that
was key for her

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.680 align:middle line:90%
was adding in the tryptophan.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.130 align:middle line:84%
She was in the office, and we
were talking about her mood

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:56.671 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
her sugar cravings.

00:47:56.671 --> 00:47:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her we
might have to have

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.950 align:middle line:84%
you give up sugar,
give up the candies.

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:02.320 align:middle line:90%
And she was very upset.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:90%
She was in a swivel chair.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And she swiveled herself
around so her back was to me.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:07.070 align:middle line:90%
And she wouldn't talk to me.

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So I said to her
don't worry about it.

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:10.189 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me how
you feel right now.

00:48:10.189 --> 00:48:12.910 align:middle line:84%
She said I'm angry and
I'm anxious that you're

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.270 align:middle line:90%
going to take away my candies.

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't understand
the scale of 1 to 10.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So we worked it out that it was
at the top end of the scale.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And I gave her a
chewable tryptophan.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And I carried on
talking to her mother.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And five minutes later,
she turned around,

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:27.300 align:middle line:84%
and she smiled at
me, and she said,

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.932 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready to give up my candy.

00:48:28.932 --> 00:48:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Really?

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.860 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: That quickly.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.825 align:middle line:84%
And I work with women, mostly
adult women, and a lot of women

00:48:33.825 --> 00:48:35.970 align:middle line:84%
will say to me, is
this really happening?

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Is this a placebo effect?

00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Could it really
happen that quickly?

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.480 align:middle line:84%
And they're often sort of
second guessing themselves,

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.630 align:middle line:84%
but when you see that happen
in a 10-year-old child,

00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:45.750 align:middle line:90%
it's just so powerful.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.860 align:middle line:84%
She has no idea what
she's been given.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.900 align:middle line:90%
But she feels good.

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:53.070 align:middle line:84%
End of the story was anger
issues gone, sleep completely

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:59.050 align:middle line:84%
resolved, and a new child,
and no sugar cravings.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.650 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:03.060 align:middle line:84%
You're working with
these clients directly.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But if someone were not working
with you, is there a way,

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.940 align:middle line:84%
are there self-tests and
such so they can find out

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.110 align:middle line:84%
which of these
particular amino acids

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:12.890 align:middle line:90%
they might be deficient in?

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:14.450 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So there
are questionnaires.

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And all the questionnaires
are in my book.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:17.460 align:middle line:84%
So people can take the
questionaires, complete them.

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.043 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:49:18.043 --> 00:49:20.115 align:middle line:84%
It's very nicely laid
out, very easy to use.

00:49:20.115 --> 00:49:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Thank you.

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And they can just
follow those through.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.070 align:middle line:10%
And if they're going
to do it on their own,

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.903 align:middle line:10%
I would encourage them
to try one at a time,

00:49:24.903 --> 00:49:26.646 align:middle line:10%
so they can see what
the results are.

00:49:26.646 --> 00:49:28.270 align:middle line:10%
And just go through
the questionnaires.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.770 align:middle line:10%
Score it.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:29.464 align:middle line:10%
Try it.

00:49:29.464 --> 00:49:30.880 align:middle line:10%
And then see what
the results are.

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.660 align:middle line:10%
And if it's not working, then
move onto the next thing.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.964 align:middle line:84%
And I work with
people in the office.

00:49:36.964 --> 00:49:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I work with people
over the phone.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.300 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working with
people long distance,

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.930 align:middle line:84%
I've got clients
all over the world,

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:44.329 align:middle line:84%
I just send them a little
package of all the amino acids.

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:46.120 align:middle line:84%
And we do the trial
over the phone as well.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.341 align:middle line:90%
So it works equally well if--

00:49:47.341 --> 00:49:48.840 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So within
five minutes you

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.020 align:middle line:84%
can usually get a read on
most of the amino acids.

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:51.603 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:49:51.603 --> 00:49:53.646 align:middle line:84%
And then you know if
that's going to work.

00:49:53.646 --> 00:49:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And then based on
how much I gave them,

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:56.570 align:middle line:90%
we know how many they need.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Because some people are what
we called pixie dust people.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a-- my colleague Carla
at the recovery systems clinic

00:50:04.110 --> 00:50:05.860 align:middle line:84%
used to call them pixie
dust people, which

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.000 align:middle line:84%
means they need a
very small amount.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And they would actually open
up a capsule and just do that.

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:12.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's how much they needed.

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Where some people
will need a whole

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:17.704 align:middle line:84%
capsule, or they may
need two or three.

00:50:17.704 --> 00:50:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So what are the
others besides tryptophan,

00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:20.920 align:middle line:90%
which is turkey?

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.254 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't that contain tryptophan?

00:50:22.254 --> 00:50:22.961 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: It does.

00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The problem is if
you eat turkey,

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:26.429 align:middle line:84%
you're getting all
the other amino acids.

00:50:26.429 --> 00:50:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So you need
it taken individually.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And I do want to just say
that the amino acids need

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.429 align:middle line:90%
to be taken between meals.

00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:36.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you have breakfast,
you would have an amino acid.

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:37.810 align:middle line:84%
Then you'd have
lunch, then you'd

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:40.084 align:middle line:84%
have an amino acid, and
then dinner and so forth.

00:50:40.084 --> 00:50:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Because then it's not
competing for absorption

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.465 align:middle line:90%
with the other proteins.

00:50:42.465 --> 00:50:43.006 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: OK.

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:45.680 align:middle line:84%
So you said there were four,
so what are the other three?

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:48.500 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So for serotonin,
it's tryptophan.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And then 5-HTP is
often used as well.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.880 align:middle line:84%
I just find most of my clients
do better on tryptophan.

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So I usually start
with tryptophan.

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.560 align:middle line:84%
For the low
catecholamines, which

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.620 align:middle line:84%
is using food and sugar
for energy, it's tyrosine.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.750 align:middle line:84%
For low gaba, which is the stiff
and tense muscles, it's gaba.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Gaba's the amino acid
and the neurotransmitter.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And then for the low
endorphins-- and this

00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:14.360 align:middle line:90%
is when someone loves chocolate.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.880 align:middle line:90%
I just love chocolate.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.565 align:middle line:84%
Or I love chocolate
chip cookies.

00:51:17.565 --> 00:51:19.440 align:middle line:84%
And they've got this
little tear in their eye

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.850 align:middle line:84%
when you say you might
have to give it up.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.977 align:middle line:84%
And they do the DPA,
which is diphenylamine-

00:51:24.977 --> 00:51:25.560 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Yes.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: --that is the one
that raises endorphine levels.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they feel
comfort, and then they

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:33.370 align:middle line:84%
don't need the chocolate or
this thing that they love.

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:34.896 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Absolutely fabulous.

00:51:34.896 --> 00:51:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And then the
final one is glutamine.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:90%
>>REGINA: Glutamine, right.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So glutamine
helps with low blood sugar.

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And we need good
stable blood sugar.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.740 align:middle line:84%
If we've got these ups and
downs throughout the day,

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.399 align:middle line:84%
we're going to feel
anxious, irritable, edgy.

00:51:46.399 --> 00:51:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Glutamine is wonderful for
stabilizing the blood sugar.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:50.315 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: It also
helps with leaky gut.

00:51:50.315 --> 00:51:51.023 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Perfect.

00:51:51.023 --> 00:51:52.307 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful for healing the gut.

00:51:52.307 --> 00:51:54.390 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: I starting taking
that a few months ago.

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.909 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:51:54.909 --> 00:51:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Wonderful.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.408 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: And it does
make any difference

00:51:57.408 --> 00:51:59.110 align:middle line:90%
in terms of appetite and sugars.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:00.140 align:middle line:90%
I'm a sugar baby.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I like just a little
bit here and there.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:04.587 align:middle line:84%
But so there will be times
really earlier in the day

00:52:04.587 --> 00:52:06.420 align:middle line:84%
until late in the evening
where I'm actually

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.400 align:middle line:84%
repulsed by the
thought of eating sugar

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.650 align:middle line:90%
when I'm taking the glutamine.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.845 align:middle line:84%
So I can say myself that
that has worked well for me.

00:52:12.845 --> 00:52:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Great.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.930 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: So meanwhile, thank
you for writing your book.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.872 align:middle line:84%
People can get an awful
lot of help out of it

00:52:17.872 --> 00:52:19.330 align:middle line:84%
without even having
to contact you.

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:19.610 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Well, thank you.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.485 align:middle line:84%
>>REGINA: Although, they
can if they want to.

00:52:21.485 --> 00:52:23.570 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so much
for joining us, Trudy.
