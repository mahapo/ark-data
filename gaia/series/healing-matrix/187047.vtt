00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:10%
>>BEN STEWART:
Paul Chek has spent

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.490 align:middle line:10%
over 30 years of
clinical practice

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:10%
developing his unique
holistic approach

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:10%
to corrective exercise,
high-performance conditioning,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.230 align:middle line:10%
and integrative
lifestyle management.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.350 align:middle line:84%
He's a holistic health
practitioner and neuromuscular

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:84%
therapist, as well as a
medicine man and a spirit guide

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
through the Native
American Council.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:84%
He's the founder of the Czech
Institute based in California,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.090 align:middle line:84%
and he's healed some of
the world's top athletes

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.450 align:middle line:84%
after potentially career-ending
injuries, one of whom

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.700 align:middle line:84%
we're actually going to be
hearing from a little later

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:90%
in the show today.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
Paul will share with us
today what each of us

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.720 align:middle line:84%
can do to be our
own best healer.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.860 align:middle line:84%
Paul, thank you so much
for joining us on the show.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>>PAUL CHEK: My pleasure.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.450 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.075 align:middle line:84%
I'm so proud of
everything that you do.

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful to be here.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.173 align:middle line:84%
Being with you, it's like
soul brothers, so thank you.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Thank you
so much for that.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.535 align:middle line:84%
Man, I want to know for my
own personal understanding--

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:20.160 align:middle line:84%
you've been speaking
about stuff that's

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
just now becoming popular thanks
to the interwebs and all that.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And you were speaking
about these things

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.270 align:middle line:84%
before it was even
cool to talk about it.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Most people didn't
even have concepts

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.402 align:middle line:84%
for this kind of
health, understanding

00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that there's more to a human
being than just the nuts

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:90%
and bolts of the body.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
What turned you onto this path?

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.950 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEK: You know, I
specialized in challenge cases.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:10%
When I moved into San
Diego from the military,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:10%
there was like five
massage therapy schools.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
There's four full
columns in the San Diego

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:90%
newspaper of massage therapist.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.120 align:middle line:10%
They're a dime a dozen.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:10%
And my approach,
right off the bat

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.890 align:middle line:10%
that I developed as the trainer
of the Army boxing team,

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.250 align:middle line:10%
was an integration
of diet management,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:10%
postural development
and correction--

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:10%
because a lot of athletes
have postural problems

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.580 align:middle line:10%
from sports-specific
muscle imbalances.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, I work with
a lot of fighters,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
so if they're right
handed, their shoulder

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is almost always low
and projected forward,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.960 align:middle line:90%
and their heads or forward.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know they're
doing that all the time.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
But that leads to all sorts
of biomechanical challenges.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:90%
So I had the diet approach.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I had the posture approach.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
I had the weight lifting and
the conditioning approach.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And I went to school to be
a sports massage therapist

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.200 align:middle line:90%
to learn more about injury care.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And the team doctor was
an osteopath physicians.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.210 align:middle line:84%
So I spent two years,
not only practicing

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
sports massage on my own
just by reading books on it

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and practicing it
with the fighters,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.860 align:middle line:84%
but I worked with an osteopathic
physician, who taught me

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
a lot about caring for
acute sports injuries

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.873 align:middle line:84%
like shoulder injuries and
broken wrists and strains,

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and you know, the kind
of stuff you get on a--

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.890 align:middle line:84%
you know, not only did
I work with the boxers.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:90%
But the military gym was where--

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:84%
Callahan Boxing Arena was
where all the top army

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.750 align:middle line:90%
athletes conditioned at.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So I got to see track
and field athletes,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.500 align:middle line:84%
power athletes,
everybody was there,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and they kept
asking me for help.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.730 align:middle line:84%
So what I did, is
I took this system,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.760 align:middle line:84%
I went through sports
massage therapy school,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and then I just needed
to make a living.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
So I went to doctors and
therapists everywhere and said,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.193 align:middle line:90%
give me the toughest clients.

00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
Give me the people that when
you see them on your schedule

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.480 align:middle line:84%
you go, oh, no, not
that person again.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And if I can't get
good results with them,

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.240 align:middle line:90%
you haven't lost anything.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And so, oddly enough,
people started

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.920 align:middle line:84%
sending me all these people that
nobody knew what to do with.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And I started getting success
after success after success.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And within a couple
of years, man, I

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.120 align:middle line:84%
was just booked to the
nines with all these people.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up with like, 36
physicians sending me business.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.350 align:middle line:90%
And I was so--

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:90%
it was radical.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.922 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I just went full
on and never looked back.

00:03:59.922 --> 00:04:01.380 align:middle line:10%
>>BEN: You also
wrote the book "How

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.910 align:middle line:10%
to Eat, Move, and Be Healthy!"

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:10%
Love this book.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEK: Thank you.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:10%
>>BEN: It's been
extremely influential.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:10%
So like, could you
tell us what it

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.010 align:middle line:10%
was that got you to the
point where you realized

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.090 align:middle line:10%
there was a void out
there and this book

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.290 align:middle line:10%
needed to be out there?

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: You know, I
was sitting one day

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.560 align:middle line:84%
with an athlete that was having
a problem I'd seen a thousand

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.790 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And I remember, you know--

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.663 align:middle line:84%
I had hired an artist to
work for me, because I'd

00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:27.330 align:middle line:84%
written hundreds of
articles, and I need

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.910 align:middle line:90%
a lot of original art made.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And so, every time I had to talk
about something over and over

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.660 align:middle line:84%
again with people, I had
handouts made for it.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm reaching in to grab
the Poopie Policeman hand out,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:84%
which shows you all
your different poops.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at
this and it hit me,

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
you know, the Poopie
Policeman said to me,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.960 align:middle line:84%
why don't you put
this in a book instead

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.140 align:middle line:84%
of just waiting until people
are sick and broken to learn

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.247 align:middle line:90%
this stuff?

00:04:53.247 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I realized, god,
I've been doing this

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.550 align:middle line:90%
for like 15 years.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And people have these
problems everywhere you go.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:90%
And I'm an expensive guy to see.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.060 align:middle line:84%
I thought, why not just put
this all in a book for $25

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and do my best to
make it so that people

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
can get healthy without having
to wait until they're sick.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So I took all my handouts,
and put it all together

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.065 align:middle line:84%
with the meanings
and the messages.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's "How to Eat,
Move, and Be Health."

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: It's extremely
influential and very, very

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.750 align:middle line:90%
well done.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.660 align:middle line:84%
You also have a book that
I like called "The Last 4

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:90%
Doctors You'll Ever Need."

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yes.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.440 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: So I want to help
the audience understand

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.450 align:middle line:84%
who are these four
doctors and if we

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:90%
can introduce them one by one.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.915 align:middle line:90%
Who's Dr. Diet?

00:05:34.915 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: Well, let's
start with Dr. Happiness,

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
because Dr. Happiness, he or
she, is the chief physician.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.530 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Happiness
represents the mind

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.040 align:middle line:84%
and [INAUDIBLE] represents
the air element.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
In the seasonal
system, it represents

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:90%
spring, a new beginning.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.810 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a new
dream, goal, or objective,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:84%
we have to have something
to guide and direct us

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.070 align:middle line:90%
or we won't participate.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.920 align:middle line:84%
We just blow it off
and make excuses.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Happy is really
the doctor that says,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.740 align:middle line:84%
what is happy making
for you and what are you

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
willing to do to grow,
to become, to change,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:84%
instead of just going
to people, complaining

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.440 align:middle line:84%
about how terrible
life is all the time

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
and not doing anything,
right, which is common?

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Happy is actually
the overarching umbrella

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:84%
under which each of the
other doctors exist.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Each of the other doctors
is another category

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:90%
of core values.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I tell my students
and patients, your yes

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
has no value until
you learn to say no.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And until you know,
for example, it's

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
my core value to
eat organic food.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I do not want to support the
destruction of the planet.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to buy cheap food.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm worth everything
to me if I--

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.310 align:middle line:84%
what's life if you're
feeling crappy all the time?

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
So Dr. Happiness
includes your beliefs

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.128 align:middle line:84%
about what is happy
making for you

00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:55.920 align:middle line:84%
and what are you willing
to do to be happy.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It includes Dr.
Diet and what are

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.560 align:middle line:84%
you willing to do to feed
your body to keep it vital?

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And what are you
willing to drink?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.350 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Movement, what are you
willing to do to move your body

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:90%
and keep it vital?

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:90%
And then you've got Dr. Quiet.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:90%
What's your value around rest?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And what is it that you
need to learn about rest?

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So each of the doctors is
sort of a category of lessons

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:84%
that I teach people,
including understanding

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:90%
the key principles.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:84%
It's a category of values,
so you know when to say yes

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.580 align:middle line:90%
and when to say no.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And each of the doctors in
my more advanced training

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
deals with you at the physical
level, the emotional level,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.490 align:middle line:84%
the mental level, and
the spiritual level.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And then the doctors
go, Dr. Happy is spring.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:42.290 align:middle line:90%
Dr. Movement, summer.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Diet, fall, because
everything-- fruits and--

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.590 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: The harvest.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:47.610 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: --we harvest.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And then winter is
Dr. Quiet when we all

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
rest and regenerate, and
the tree sends its energy

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.180 align:middle line:90%
under the earth.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So that basically,
those four doctors, you

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.390 align:middle line:90%
can't be healthy without them.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
You can't be a healthy
person with three doctors.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Try skipping winter, right?

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Try not sleeping.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.390 align:middle line:84%
Try knowing how to rest,
knowing what you want to do

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.210 align:middle line:84%
and exercising, but
not eating well.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.330 align:middle line:84%
No matter which way you
go, you cannot avoid--

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that's the absolute
essentials you

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:84%
have to have to be a
healthy person, physically,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.380 align:middle line:84%
emotionally, mentally,
and spiritually.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.065 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Speaking of
Dr. Movement, Paul

00:08:25.065 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and I met yesterday to do
a movement practice where

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:84%
we definitely called upon at
least three of these doctors.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Let's take a look.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: So, Ben, I want to take
you through the Five Animal

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Frolics.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go by the
elements of Chinese medicine.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.000 align:middle line:84%
So I want to take
you through how

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
do you use these things
very spontaneously, very

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.277 align:middle line:90%
naturally, very playfully.

00:08:45.277 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter if
you get anything wrong.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.100 align:middle line:90%
There is no right or wrong.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.763 align:middle line:84%
So what I do with
these exercises,

00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:53.680 align:middle line:84%
when people are having
a hard time meditating,

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.860 align:middle line:84%
I show them how to use
any one or combination

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.350 align:middle line:84%
of these exercises
to progressively

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.830 align:middle line:84%
calm them down, balance
themselves, center themselves,

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.540 align:middle line:84%
so that as they relax naturally,
the meditative state comes on

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.940 align:middle line:90%
naturally, effortlessly.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.040 align:middle line:84%
So my favorite to start
with is the dragon.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.380 align:middle line:84%
So each one has just a
few key characteristics.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.757 align:middle line:84%
The dragon loves
to breathe fire.

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:19.680 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATING DRAGON SOUND]

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
The dragon, of course,
loves to fly, right?

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
And the dragon has a big tail
that they use as a weapon.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:90%
[SWISHING SOUND]

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.530 align:middle line:90%
So we fly.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:90%
[IMITATING DRAGON SOUND]

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:90%
[SWISHING SOUND]

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.570 align:middle line:84%
The monkey is whenever your
emotions are out of balance,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.060 align:middle line:84%
you just feel blocked
inside, angry, grumpy.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.040 align:middle line:90%
So you're just like, ah.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:52.020 align:middle line:84%
So monkeys like to swing
from vines and trees,

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
and they like to you know,
[MAKING MONKEY SOUNDS]

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:90%
dance around.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see, just
a little bit of that,

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.920 align:middle line:90%
it stimulates you, right?

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And so part of it
is breaking out

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.945 align:middle line:84%
of our rigid mental structures
and just being a monkey.

00:10:09.945 --> 00:10:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Monkeys don't give
a damn, right?

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.780 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: And they play,
introducing play.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Exactly.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.962 align:middle line:90%
Just be playful.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:16.170 align:middle line:90%
Who cares what it looks like?

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.570 align:middle line:84%
It's about going with it
and being spontaneous.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Then we got the eagle,
air element, mind.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
focus your mind,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:31.470 align:middle line:84%
you need to write a thesis or a
paper or an outline for a show,

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
you want to enhance
mental performance,

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
then the eagle is the master,
because we have to think ahead.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:90%
What are we going to do?

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
An Eagle's got the greatest
eyes of all the creatures

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:84%
out there, best distance,
vision, close-up vision.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.370 align:middle line:84%
The eagle loves
to be way up high.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:90%
They perch way up high.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.530 align:middle line:84%
So the features of
the eagle is that one,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:56.460 align:middle line:84%
it perches way up high
and watches its territory.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
Then it swoops
down, and it likes

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.920 align:middle line:84%
to fly and just take a look
at everything from above.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.160 align:middle line:84%
When it sees something it
wants, it comes from its top

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and [SWISHING SOUND] gets
its prey and eats it.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:16.830 align:middle line:84%
So its flying, its perching,
its looking off in the distance,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.030 align:middle line:84%
looking for what it wants to eat
or who it needs to know about.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The tiger is a very stealth,
very powerful creature that

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.385 align:middle line:90%
moves quietly in the brush.

00:11:32.385 --> 00:11:35.215 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.215 --> 00:11:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And tigers wait patiently, and
then when they see their prey,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:46.120 align:middle line:90%
they [GRUNTS] take it, fast.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.100 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel really?

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.090 align:middle line:84%
A little bit-- are you
calmed down a little?

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.215 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Definitely awake enough--

00:11:50.215 --> 00:11:51.130 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: It opens you up.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: --a sweat.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Calms you down.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So now that we've got a person
to the point where they're

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.350 align:middle line:84%
genuinely ready to calm
their mind down and relax

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
a little bit, we
do the stork walk.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going
to go a step slower.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:12.830 align:middle line:10%
So as you inhale,
bring your arms up

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:10%
and draw your one foot up.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:10%
Put it behind your
leg like a stork.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:10%
Let your fingertips
hang like figs

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.390 align:middle line:10%
towards the crown of your head.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.562 align:middle line:90%
As you exhale, step.

00:12:22.562 --> 00:12:27.777 align:middle line:84%
[EXHALES] When you're
ready to inhale,

00:12:27.777 --> 00:12:29.110 align:middle line:90%
tongue on the roof of the mouth.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Breath in through
the nose and step.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:36.280 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So you do the stork
walk until you

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.360 align:middle line:84%
get that sense of my
breathing is calmed down now.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm connected to the earth.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:90%
I've got my playfulness.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.330 align:middle line:90%
I've moved myself.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.050 align:middle line:90%
I've been creative.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:90%
I've hit each of the elements.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.530 align:middle line:90%
I've integrated myself.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.920 align:middle line:90%
Now I'm ready to get quiet.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:90%
So there you go.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
That is a very simple, very
fun practice, five animal

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:08.020 align:middle line:84%
exercises, leading to
something a little less active,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:90%
slowing down.

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.490 align:middle line:84%
Breathe the love
of the universe in.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:17.801 align:middle line:84%
Fill the qi bubble, relax your
mind, and give it away all day.

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:18.601 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Legend.

00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Aho, baby.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.759 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Aho.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:90%


00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.380 align:middle line:90%
That was so much fun.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.510 align:middle line:84%
I think my favorite part
of it was the dragon.

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.160 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Good, I love the dragon.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.540 align:middle line:90%
The dragon's magical.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you need a little
magic, you bring the dragon in.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.902 align:middle line:84%
And many of us like
to breathe fire,

00:13:36.902 --> 00:13:38.110 align:middle line:90%
but we don't get a chance to.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.485 align:middle line:84%
So when you get
to be the dragon,

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:40.560 align:middle line:90%
you get to breathe fire.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.410 align:middle line:90%
You get to fly.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:84%
So it just kind of brings
the mystique of childhood

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:90%
back into an adult life.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But paradoxically, oh, those
kid things turn out to be real.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:49.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: And also
very healthy for us.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.530 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yes, exactly.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: These four doctors--

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear a little
bit of an example.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Introducing these four doctors
into some of your clients

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.980 align:middle line:84%
lives, do you have any
examples of some profound

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.710 align:middle line:84%
transformations that
you've seen just

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:10.220 align:middle line:84%
by introducing these four
doctors to them, even

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:90%
on a small level?

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.300 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Countless.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.100 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Yeah?

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Countless.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.635 align:middle line:90%
Almost everybody.

00:14:14.635 --> 00:14:14.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Almost everyone.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.275 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: One of the
most profound things

00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:21.740 align:middle line:84%
is they go, oh, I had no idea
that sleep was that important.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And when I show them how the
human hormonal system follows

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:84%
the sun, and as the
sun's going down,

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.940 align:middle line:84%
cortisol levels are dropping
down, which, at the same time,

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.150 align:middle line:84%
melatonin begins to rise
to put you to sleep,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.628 align:middle line:84%
and if you don't let your
cortisol levels drop down,

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
if you don't go down
with the light--

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.140 align:middle line:84%
you keep watching television,
staying buzzed up and wound up,

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:90%
or drinking coffee--

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:90%
then melatonin won't release.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is they
can never fall asleep.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So they lay in this
sort of comatose state

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.830 align:middle line:84%
where they're not asleep, but
they're not awake very well

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:90%
either.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.730 align:middle line:84%
But they wake up, and they've
got bags under their eyes,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.105 align:middle line:84%
and they feel
tired all the time.

00:14:59.105 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:84%
So when I just show them
the principles of rest

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and how it's the foundation
of your creativity, your sex

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.400 align:middle line:90%
life, your vitality--

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:84%
but you are made
by the universe.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:90%
You are the sun.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.720 align:middle line:90%
You are the moon.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.040 align:middle line:90%
You are the earth.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Those laws came before
your sense of self emerged.

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're built on
the matrix of nature.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And when we work against
the matrix, it costs us.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.913 align:middle line:84%
And it ends up costing
us not only our vitality

00:15:25.913 --> 00:15:27.580 align:middle line:84%
but a lot of money
because we run around

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to doctors who give us pills
[CHUCKLES] instead of telling

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.823 align:middle line:90%
us what's really going on.

00:15:30.823 --> 00:15:32.240 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Right, those
other doctors.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yeah.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Another big thing today
is, widespread, some are even

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.280 align:middle line:84%
saying that this is one
of the reasons why this

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
is the first generation
where parents might outlive

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.420 align:middle line:90%
their own children.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: [CHUCKLES]
I don't doubt it.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.595 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Such a
sedentary lifestyle.

00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
Everybody is sitting
hunched over,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.610 align:middle line:90%
watching, being very passive.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So the importance of movement
and introducing movement

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.085 align:middle line:90%
into people's lives--

00:15:56.085 --> 00:15:57.460 align:middle line:84%
could you just
explain to us some

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:59.680 align:middle line:84%
of the importance
of healthy movement

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:84%
and compare it to maybe
some unhealthy movement?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: Well, you know,
unhealthy movement is,

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.950 align:middle line:84%
one, lack of movement, two,
minimizing your movement

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:09.880 align:middle line:90%
patterns too much.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.910 align:middle line:84%
In my system, I
analyzed human beings

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and what it took to
survive in nature

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and identified that we had to
have seven key primal movement

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:90%
patterns.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.895 align:middle line:84%
We must be able to do these
with at least our body

00:16:21.895 --> 00:16:23.800 align:middle line:84%
weight, efficiently
and effectively

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.400 align:middle line:84%
enough to integrate
with our environment.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:90%
We all have to squat.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
No one can get-- you know,
try pooping standing up.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't work very well.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
We have to get in
and out of chairs.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.545 align:middle line:84%
We have to get in
and out of cars.

00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:37.087 align:middle line:84%
And getting in and
out of a car, it's

00:16:37.087 --> 00:16:40.610 align:middle line:84%
a single-legged squat with
a lateral shift and a twist.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
We've got people that can barely
get up and down out of a chair.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:90%
So we have to squat.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.550 align:middle line:90%
We have to lunge.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.390 align:middle line:90%
We have to bend.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.190 align:middle line:90%
We have to push.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:48.080 align:middle line:90%
We have to pull.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:90%
And we have to twist.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have to have gait, which
is walking, running, jogging,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and running.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone may not
have to jog or even run,

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.045 align:middle line:90%
but they have to walk.

00:16:59.045 --> 00:16:59.920 align:middle line:90%
And we have to twist.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.090 align:middle line:90%
We reach for doors.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.440 align:middle line:90%
We pull on handles.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:90%
We open things.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Lunging-- people go
up and down stairs,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.947 align:middle line:84%
which is very much
like a lunge pattern.

00:17:08.947 --> 00:17:11.020 align:middle line:84%
So basically, when
you stop losing--

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.119 align:middle line:84%
when you lose the ability
to do these patterns,

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.430 align:middle line:84%
that's exactly how
you get injured.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
The day you try to do something
with a little bit of a twist

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.079 align:middle line:84%
or a little bit
of a load on you,

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.580 align:middle line:84%
and you've gotten too
sedentary, boom, your back goes.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:90%
Your knee goes.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.880 align:middle line:90%
Something goes.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
So what I told
people to just play.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:90%
Use your body weight.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.300 align:middle line:84%
Just squat, lunge,
bend, push, pull, twist.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.800 align:middle line:90%
Push-- you know, throw a ball.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.350 align:middle line:84%
There's a push pattern with a
twist and a lunge in it, right?

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:38.970 align:middle line:84%
Just throwing a ball
is three patterns.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.410 align:middle line:90%
Pick up boxes.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Use the vacuum but take bigger
steps and make it practical.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Really get into it, right?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.650 align:middle line:84%
You could clean a
house and make it fun

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and make it better fitness than
most people are doing today.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.060 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: So it sounds like to me,
because you mentioned seven,

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.065 align:middle line:84%
what you call in your book,
the primal movements--

00:18:01.065 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: Movement
patterns-- yeah.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.190 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Because every
other movement really

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.370 align:middle line:90%
spawns from that foundation.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And what it sounds like to me
is bring consciousness or more

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:15.070 align:middle line:84%
awareness into the movements
that we're doing all day long,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.040 align:middle line:84%
thinking that, oh, all I
did was pick up a pencil.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:84%
People throw their backs
out picking up pencils.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So what it seems
like you're saying

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.597 align:middle line:84%
is bring a little bit more
conscious awareness to the fact

00:18:24.597 --> 00:18:27.820 align:middle line:84%
that we're almost always moving
throughout the day anyway,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.800 align:middle line:84%
but with a little
bit more awareness,

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.740 align:middle line:84%
these movements will
be more, I guess,

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
aligned with our
body, our own weight.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And we can at least
sense when we're

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.008 align:middle line:84%
overtaxing a part of our
body that's overcompensating

00:18:40.008 --> 00:18:41.300 align:middle line:90%
for something that's shut down.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: Well, yes, and I
think part of it is just,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.410 align:middle line:84%
A, if you can't get to the
gym, or you can't get outside

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
to do a good, vigorous
exercise session three, four,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.670 align:middle line:84%
or five times a week,
then be conscious

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.862 align:middle line:84%
that you're moving all the time
and say, OK, if I'm a bend over

00:18:57.862 --> 00:18:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and pick up a pencil and
that's too easy, well,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
then, for fun, I'm going
to do it on one leg.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.690 align:middle line:84%
And then if that's
too easy, say,

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to just pick
it up with two fingers.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:07.573 align:middle line:84%
And if it takes you
three tries, good.

00:19:07.573 --> 00:19:10.720 align:middle line:84%
You got three times
the exercise out of it.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Try to figure out how can you
stretch yourself a little bit.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.010 align:middle line:90%
How can you grow a little bit?

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.070 align:middle line:84%
How can you participate
in your own life

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
by taking advantage of the
situation that you have?

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, get on and off the
toilet but do it really slow.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.630 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.490 align:middle line:84%
Take 10 seconds to
lower to that toilet,

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and your legs are going
to start to shake,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to know
you did something, right?

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So by just being
more zen about it--

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:84%
you know, true
spirituality is not

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.740 align:middle line:84%
something you
practice on Sunday.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
It's something you eat,
sleep, breathe, and live.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:48.850 align:middle line:84%
So I'm saying exercise
and consciousness

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.258 align:middle line:84%
of eating and breathing--
those are things that we just

00:19:51.258 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:90%
need to pay attention to.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if we don't, we have
to wait until we're sick.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.000 align:middle line:84%
And only then, if you're
lucky, will someone tell you,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.400 align:middle line:84%
oh, by the way, you don't
know how to breathe properly.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.510 align:middle line:84%
Oh, by the way, your
body's out of shape.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
taking the opportunity

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.910 align:middle line:84%
to maximize your environment
so that you minimize

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.370 align:middle line:84%
the likelihood of
being in pain and not

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.470 align:middle line:84%
being able to do the
things you love to do.

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.845 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: You hear
a lot of people--

00:20:15.845 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to work out.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.420 align:middle line:84%
Working out-- and
that's that phrase

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.940 align:middle line:84%
that we always hear about, oh,
that's addressing the body.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.010 align:middle line:84%
But I've heard you
mention working in.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yes.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: What does that mean?

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And why is that so important
for people to understand?

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: Well,
today, as you know,

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.880 align:middle line:84%
one of our biggest
challenges with people

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:32.740 align:middle line:90%
is chronic global inflammation.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:34.240 align:middle line:90%
We have metabolic syndrome.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:84%
Food is very toxic to the
body-- commercial food.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:84%
So people keep buying
cheap food and thinking

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.165 align:middle line:90%
they're saving money.

00:20:41.165 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:84%
People don't realize most of
them are gluten intolerance.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Most of these hybridized
grains, we can't digest.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So anytime you eat or drink
things that your body--

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.220 align:middle line:84%
that are not right for
your genetic needs,

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.600 align:middle line:90%
it triggers off inflammation.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
If you are exposed to too much
electromagnetic pollution,

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:90%
it causes global inflammation.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.230 align:middle line:84%
So what I wanted to encourage
people to do-- the athletes

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.130 align:middle line:90%
need to cool down.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.660 align:middle line:84%
So working in is doing
exercises at a pace that do not

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
elevate your heart rate, do not
elevate your breathing rate,

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.408 align:middle line:84%
that you can do
on a full stomach.

00:21:13.408 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
doing them correctly,

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.220 align:middle line:84%
your tongue stays moist because
the parasympathetic nervous

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.490 align:middle line:84%
system, which is the
digest, eliminate,

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
the growth, and repair branch
of the autonomic nervous system,

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle line:90%
is active.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.570 align:middle line:84%
So because the tongue's part
of the digestive system,

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.550 align:middle line:84%
you can tell when you're
parasympathetically

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.770 align:middle line:84%
active because your
mouth stays wet.

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.695 align:middle line:84%
But if you start doing squats,
and you start going too fast,

00:21:35.695 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and your heart rate goes
up, soon your tongue

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:90%
dries right out.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.085 align:middle line:84%
And if you work out
on a full stomach,

00:21:41.085 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:90%
it makes you feel terrible.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.590 align:middle line:84%
So when you get all these
ass-kicker athletes,

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and I want to slow
them down, I say,

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.950 align:middle line:84%
here, I'm going to teach you
how to do these exercises,

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:49.783 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to do
them right after you've

00:21:49.783 --> 00:21:51.020 align:middle line:90%
had a great big meal.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So what it does is it harmonizes
your brain, your heart,

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.265 align:middle line:84%
and your solar plexus, which are
called biological oscillators.

00:21:58.265 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Those are the key
centers that generate

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:90%
electromagnetic energy.

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So it entrains each
of our nerve centers,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:07.030 align:middle line:84%
and it harmonizes
our hormonal center.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.970 align:middle line:84%
And it harmonizes peristalsis
and pressure waves

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
through the body so we can
easily go into peak states.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And all these centers now
are talking to each other.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Just like when you're filming,
the cameras have to be in sync.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the editor is
like what is going on.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Paul's talking, but Ben's
like a minute behind him.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:90%
It'll drive you crazy.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So in order for us to
live naturally and pick up

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.790 align:middle line:84%
on the cues of the environment
and be in a flow state

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:84%
and take advantage of
the wisdom in our body,

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.340 align:middle line:84%
we need these three
centers online.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So working in actually
has a cooling effect.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
A feminine in Chinese medicine's
called yin, which you know of.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And most people are so
yang or fiery, right?

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.800 align:middle line:90%
They're too over inflamed.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you don't
exercise enough-- here's

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:84%
a paradox for you-- you
decondition to the point

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.480 align:middle line:84%
where getting out of the
chair and walking to your car

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.100 align:middle line:90%
is overtraining.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Getting on and off a
toilet's overtraining.

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I've had patients that could
not walk up one flight of stairs

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.170 align:middle line:84%
without being
completely exhausted.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
I've seen research
papers that show

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:13.660 align:middle line:84%
50% of people going
to see a physician

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.990 align:middle line:84%
hit their lactate threshold
walking from the waiting

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.608 align:middle line:90%
room to the doctor's office.

00:23:18.608 --> 00:23:20.150 align:middle line:84%
For those of you
that don't know what

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that means, when you hit
your lactate threshold,

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.310 align:middle line:84%
it means you're
panting, and you're

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.092 align:middle line:84%
producing so much
lactic acid, your legs

00:23:26.092 --> 00:23:27.550 align:middle line:84%
feel like they're
going to lock up.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.092 align:middle line:84%
It's like a bodybuilder
who's getting

00:23:29.092 --> 00:23:32.380 align:middle line:84%
the last few reps of their
set, and they're screaming, ah.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.020 align:middle line:84%
People are hitting their
lactate threshold--

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:84%
50% of people going
to a doctor hit

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.150 align:middle line:84%
it walking from the waiting
room to the examination room.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.230 align:middle line:84%
That's how far down
the road we are.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So because working in
cultivates life force energy,

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.690 align:middle line:84%
you bring in more
energy per unit of time

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.760 align:middle line:90%
than you're actually spending.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.610 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
do five breathing squats,

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.760 align:middle line:84%
you bring in more life force
energy through the action

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.020 align:middle line:90%
than it costs you to do it.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
working out, you're

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.958 align:middle line:84%
spending more energy and
resources per unit of time.

00:24:03.958 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's why you have to
recover from a workout.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.380 align:middle line:84%
It leaves you in a
state of depletion.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.580 align:middle line:90%
Working in tops you up, man.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: I love that.

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's really putting
it into simple terms,

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.780 align:middle line:90%
the economics of it in a sense.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yeah.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: You know, inflow
as opposed to outflow.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.380 align:middle line:84%
One of the words
I hear a lot, when

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:23.560 align:middle line:84%
it comes to actually working
out or just exercise in general,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.710 align:middle line:90%
is functional.

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:25.510 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yes.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: So explain to us, what
is a functional exercise?

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.220 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: It's a big
topic of discussion.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
very confused on it.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.260 align:middle line:84%
But really, I define
a functional exercise

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
as any exercise that actually
enhances your ability

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.320 align:middle line:84%
to thrive in the environment
that you either work in

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.200 align:middle line:84%
or what sport you're
doing or play in.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.080 align:middle line:84%
Like if you were a
recreational kayaker,

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:84%
or you like to take your kids
hiking or riding the bicycle,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.800 align:middle line:84%
if you were actually
doing functional exercise,

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.260 align:middle line:84%
the outcome of that
exercise process

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.100 align:middle line:84%
is that you get better at
doing the things you want to do

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and that you need to do to be
effective in your environment.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: OK.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that totally makes sense
that the word functional--

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.290 align:middle line:84%
it's functional in the
things that you're doing

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.790 align:middle line:90%
most often during the day.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: For example,
a lot of bodybuilders

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.650 align:middle line:84%
are very, very big, but
they're very dysfunctional.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.040 align:middle line:84%
I've worked with countless
professional sports teams that

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.280 align:middle line:84%
didn't know any better and were
using body building approaches

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
and things like hammer
strength and side backs and all

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:90%
the isolation equipment.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But when I do agility tests and
coordination tests and balance

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.020 align:middle line:84%
tests and motor skills
tests, they're terrible.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.770 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
terrible because whenever

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.220 align:middle line:84%
you use a machine or any
device that stabilizes you,

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:84%
your inner unit, the core
stabilizer muscles that

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.590 align:middle line:84%
integrate your arms,
legs, and torso together,

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.780 align:middle line:84%
shut off because
your body doesn't

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.222 align:middle line:90%
need to expend the energy.

00:25:51.222 --> 00:25:52.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're
sitting on a leg press,

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.520 align:middle line:90%
why turn your core on?

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.780 align:middle line:84%
If you're leaning against
the bar on a Smith machine,

00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.200 align:middle line:84%
why would your brain
want to spend the energy?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.190 align:middle line:84%
The human body runs off what's
called the MENS system, Minimal

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Electrical Neuromuscular
Stimulation, which

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:09.290 align:middle line:84%
means your body will not spend
any energy to activate anything

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.373 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't have to because
in nature, as you know,

00:26:11.373 --> 00:26:12.748 align:middle line:84%
there's periods
where we would go

00:26:12.748 --> 00:26:14.230 align:middle line:90%
without food for a long time.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.790 align:middle line:90%
Things weren't so easy.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So the system is designed
to be very efficient.

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you keep using
forms of exercise that

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.965 align:middle line:84%
don't trigger the body
to actually integrate

00:26:23.965 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
the stabilizer systems and
the prime mover systems,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:90%
well, you become dysfunctional.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.250 align:middle line:90%
Your joints start to hurt.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.360 align:middle line:90%
Your back starts to hurt.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.262 align:middle line:84%
And your posture
starts to get bad,

00:26:33.262 --> 00:26:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and then you're
breathings crowded.

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.460 align:middle line:84%
And your digestion
starts to get screwed up

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.320 align:middle line:84%
because your organs are not
sitting in the right position.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.490 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: It's a snowball effect.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.180 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: It's a snowball effect.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Yeah.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So I've heard you say something
to the tune of there's

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:49.030 align:middle line:84%
no such thing as a
bad exercise, just

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.600 align:middle line:90%
a poorly prescribed exercise.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.400 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yes.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: And that
was very new to me,

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.870 align:middle line:84%
and I would really love to
hear what your take is on that

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.902 align:middle line:84%
because I actually really
thought there would be

00:26:57.902 --> 00:26:59.110 align:middle line:90%
some bad exercises out there.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: Well, you know,
it's a good point.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:90%
So think of what I just said.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people would
say, wait a minute.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
You just said all these
machines weren't good.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you I've had
brain injured patients that

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.920 align:middle line:84%
could not do a
functional exercise

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.060 align:middle line:84%
because they were too injured to
integrate enough of their body

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.440 align:middle line:90%
to stand up.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
So in a case like
that, I might have

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.330 align:middle line:84%
somebody doing a knee extension
or a hamstring curl or a leg

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:90%
press.

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:29.900 align:middle line:84%
I take them to the environment
where it's the safest for them,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and then I might have
to use other exercises

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.490 align:middle line:90%
to activate their core.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.340 align:middle line:84%
So I always believe that
whenever a person is not

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.980 align:middle line:84%
integrated, you have to isolate
the muscles that aren't working

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.960 align:middle line:84%
and progressively integrate
them into the system.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.810 align:middle line:84%
But the point that I'm
making with that comment--

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
there's no such thing
as a bad exercise,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.450 align:middle line:84%
only an incorrectly
prescribed exercise--

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:84%
is if you know how to prescribe
exercise like medicine,

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.710 align:middle line:84%
well, you don't just eat a whole
bottle of aspirin just hoping

00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:90%
not to get a headache.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But if you do have
a headache, and it's

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.290 align:middle line:84%
so bad that you
need to do something

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.170 align:middle line:84%
while you try to figure
out a natural approach,

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:06.680 align:middle line:90%
then you prescribe that.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
saying everything

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.710 align:middle line:84%
has some application,
but you have

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.470 align:middle line:84%
to be conscious of whether
or not it's doing--

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.460 align:middle line:84%
it's going to do what
you want it to do

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and whether or not it's creating
more problems than good.

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:23.340 align:middle line:84%
And my rule is start with
the most functional exercise,

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
and if you can't do it,
then take one step back.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.170 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do that,
take one step back.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.190 align:middle line:84%
If you can't do that,
go one step back.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
But if you go lay on a machine,
or you're on the floor,

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:34.743 align:middle line:90%
you've just gone your--

00:28:34.743 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
worked yourself right
into the basement,

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.785 align:middle line:84%
but you haven't
even really tried

00:28:37.785 --> 00:28:41.630 align:middle line:84%
doing something like just simply
doing a lunge or doing a squat.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.747 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you're getting
on and off the toilet,

00:28:43.747 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:84%
but you're going to the
gym and using a leg press,

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:84%
you've gone neurologically
backwards about five levels,

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.960 align:middle line:90%
compared to the toilet.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.303 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Yeah, breathing
in movement--

00:28:53.303 --> 00:28:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yes, very important.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.560 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: What is the importance
of breathing in movement?

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.838 align:middle line:90%
Does it synchronize?

00:28:58.838 --> 00:29:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Help us understand this
because I know there's probably

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.860 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people out there
that have incorrect or even

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.150 align:middle line:90%
inverse breathing patterns.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.750 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: They do.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:06.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lot of
confusion about that.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.760 align:middle line:84%
All the way to the very,
very highest levels

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
of athletics and,
in fact, having

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.470 align:middle line:84%
looked at countless personal
trainer and strength training,

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:84%
strength coach
certifications, I've

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
never seen a single one
yet that has the breathing

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.120 align:middle line:84%
patterns and the movement
patterns tied together

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:24.920 align:middle line:90%
properly.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.800 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Hm.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: So the
thing to remember is

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.890 align:middle line:84%
when we're moving toward
the fetal position,

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.160 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system
is wired to exhale.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you're doing a cable
push or a bench press,

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.930 align:middle line:84%
if you take a bench press
and just keep going,

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.950 align:middle line:84%
you end up in the
fetal position.

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if someone's
doing a bench press

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.830 align:middle line:84%
and they're inhaling,
the active inhalation

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:84%
fires the extensive
system in the body.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.780 align:middle line:10%
So if you're doing a deadlift or
picking up a box off the floor,

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.570 align:middle line:10%
you want to inhale
as you're doing it.

00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:57.320 align:middle line:10%
Or if it's too heavy to
breathe through, inhale,

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.170 align:middle line:10%
lift the weight, and
then as you come down,

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:02.390 align:middle line:10%
pass through the hardest
point in the lift called

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:05.090 align:middle line:10%
the sticking point, then
breathe through pursed lip

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:06.200 align:middle line:10%
to keep the core active.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.090 align:middle line:90%
[EXHALES] Right?

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.490 align:middle line:84%
So the key point is if you're
moving toward the feet--

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.487 align:middle line:84%
so if you're doing a
cable push, you're going

00:30:13.487 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:90%
toward the fetal position.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing a cable
pull, you're getting taller.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.560 align:middle line:90%
You're getting longer.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.420 align:middle line:90%
You should be inhaling.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing a chin up, and
your hands are turned forward,

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:26.450 align:middle line:84%
as you pull the bar toward
your chest, your chest opens.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:27.620 align:middle line:90%
That's inhalation.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, if you
turn your grip around,

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:84%
as you're doing the pull
up, if you keep that going,

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.330 align:middle line:84%
it takes you right into
the fetal position.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:84%
So to see which way you
should be breathing, take

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.403 align:middle line:84%
any movement, and magnify
it to an end range.

00:30:40.403 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you're going
toward the fetal position,

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.110 align:middle line:84%
the movement will be
enhanced by exhalation.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.370 align:middle line:84%
If you're coming out
of the fetal position,

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.708 align:middle line:84%
so if I'm doing an
Olympic clean and press,

00:30:50.708 --> 00:30:52.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm coming out of
the fetal position.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.100 align:middle line:84%
That should be prefaced
with inhalation.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.260 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: We actually have
a video, some video,

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.152 align:middle line:84%
of Paul demonstrating
how to integrate

00:30:59.152 --> 00:31:00.110 align:middle line:90%
breathing and movement.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.020 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: So what we
want to do is begin

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.440 align:middle line:84%
a very basic practice of
coupling breathing and moving

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.800 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's
just take the concept

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:16.210 align:middle line:84%
of throwing a ball because
we're all familiar with that.

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Pretend you're going
to throw a ball.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:24.130 align:middle line:84%
You would begin by opening the
body, which is inhalation--

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:84%
so timing the breathing
and the movement

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.620 align:middle line:84%
together so that the
cycles of the movement

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.050 align:middle line:84%
and the cycles of the
breathing are timed together.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:34.130 align:middle line:90%
So my inhalation begins now.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:38.200 align:middle line:90%


00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.740 align:middle line:84%
And my full breath
ends right when my arm

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.020 align:middle line:90%
reaches the cocked position.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And then my
exhalation begins as I

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.120 align:middle line:84%
begin to move as though
I'm throwing the ball.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:54.870 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.180 align:middle line:84%
When my hand stops
and body stops moving,

00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:00.330 align:middle line:84%
the breath should
end simultaneously.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember, as you're
bringing the breath in,

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.153 align:middle line:90%
breathe through the nose.

00:32:04.153 --> 00:32:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Keep the tongue on
the roof of the mouth

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.980 align:middle line:84%
to connect the meridian system
and anchor the postural system.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.430 align:middle line:90%
Belly is expanding.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:30.542 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.542 --> 00:32:31.625 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: That was brilliant.

00:32:31.625 --> 00:32:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so
structural and fundamental

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.320 align:middle line:84%
to people's movement to
understand how breath actually

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.460 align:middle line:90%
links up with it.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.720 align:middle line:84%
If you had to just say one
thing that most people should

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.240 align:middle line:84%
be including into their
movement repertoire,

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.770 align:middle line:90%
what do you think that would be?

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.312 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: I think it
would be awareness

00:32:50.312 --> 00:32:53.810 align:middle line:84%
of two things-- the core
because if you don't know

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.150 align:middle line:84%
how to use your core
properly, you can't stabilize

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.200 align:middle line:90%
your body effectively.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And the most common
result of that

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.550 align:middle line:84%
is back injuries, which is the
most common orthopedic injury

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.630 align:middle line:90%
there is.

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
other would be breath.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:84%
If you are aware of your
breath, like I was just showing,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.690 align:middle line:84%
you see as you're exhaling
and moving, which, by the way,

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.110 align:middle line:84%
that was a work in-- that's
a low-intensity, functional

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.930 align:middle line:84%
exercise done without
elevating the respiratory rate

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:19.370 align:middle line:90%
or breathing rate.

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And so for a baseball
player, for example--

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.830 align:middle line:84%
say, a center fielder or an
outfielder or a pitcher--

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.190 align:middle line:84%
that very exercise
trains them to integrate

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.170 align:middle line:84%
the breathing and the
movement and harmonize

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.810 align:middle line:84%
the biological oscillators
in the exact pattern

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:35.970 align:middle line:84%
that they have to perform
with high intensity.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.740 align:middle line:84%
So it preprograms
the system when

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.080 align:middle line:84%
the mind is relaxed so
that when they go to do it,

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:84%
all the little bits of the
program are in the right place,

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:46.910 align:middle line:90%
and it comes off magically.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.420 align:middle line:84%
So being aware of the breath
and the sequence of how you are

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
breathing while you're moving--
i.e. is it in the right phase--

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and then knowing that as
you're applying force,

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.410 align:middle line:84%
you need to draw the belly
button in just a little bit.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.660 align:middle line:84%
If it's a lot of force,
you draw it in more.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.760 align:middle line:84%
Like if you're lifting a heavy
box, inhale, draw your core in,

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and as the force goes
up with the lift,

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.380 align:middle line:84%
pull tighter to
create your own weight

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.800 align:middle line:84%
belt, your internal
weight belt. Weight belts

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.090 align:middle line:84%
don't work because they
don't attach to the spine,

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:20.659 align:middle line:84%
but when you draw
your belly button in,

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:22.670 align:middle line:84%
the transverse abdominis,
the deepest layer

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.620 align:middle line:84%
of the abdominal wall,
actually attaches

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.949 align:middle line:84%
right to the transverse
processes and the spinous

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.239 align:middle line:90%
processes of the lumbar spine.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.600 align:middle line:84%
So when you activate
your own weight

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.850 align:middle line:84%
belt, or your own girdle, you
stabilize your whole spine

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:36.650 align:middle line:90%
and rib cage.

00:34:36.650 --> 00:34:38.719 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't do that,
the force from the legs

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:40.580 align:middle line:84%
can't effectively make
it through the arms,

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.530 align:middle line:90%
into the arms and the hands.

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So people swinging implements,
lifting heavy weights--

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.893 align:middle line:84%
if their core is
not working, well,

00:34:48.893 --> 00:34:51.560 align:middle line:84%
the stronger their legs are, the
faster they destroy their back.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:54.320 align:middle line:84%
The stronger their arms are, the
faster they destroy their back.

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: And I'm sure
you've had to rehab people

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.967 align:middle line:84%
from a lot of these injuries
that people are just

00:34:58.967 --> 00:35:00.050 align:middle line:90%
doing incorrect movements.

00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Countless.

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Tell us about a
little bit of your work

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:05.623 align:middle line:84%
rehabbing people from injuries
from doing incorrect movement.

00:35:05.623 --> 00:35:07.040 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: Well,
basically, what I do

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:09.500 align:middle line:84%
is I have a comprehensive
movement analysis.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.680 align:middle line:84%
I begin with assessing
infant development.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.030 align:middle line:84%
I check the range of
motion of all their joints

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.750 align:middle line:84%
so I know exactly which joints
are moving normally and not

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.370 align:middle line:90%
normally.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:90%
I evaluate the soft tissues.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.280 align:middle line:90%
I evaluate posture.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.410 align:middle line:84%
I've calibrated
instruments that I patented

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.040 align:middle line:84%
to measure certain postural
dynamics that, prior, were

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.460 align:middle line:90%
never measured effectively.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.410 align:middle line:90%
I look at their diet history.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.750 align:middle line:90%
I have a comprehensive diet log.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.150 align:middle line:84%
I look at their
mental-emotional stress.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I look at how their physical
body and its challenges

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:43.820 align:middle line:84%
correlate to the chakra
system, which then points

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.030 align:middle line:90%
to the mental-emotional issues.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.553 align:middle line:84%
And so when I take all that--
and I also do functional

00:35:48.553 --> 00:35:50.720 align:middle line:84%
movement screening, so I
have them go through infant

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:53.900 align:middle line:84%
development practices that we
should all be naturally able

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.350 align:middle line:84%
to do if we're an
adult. Most can't.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I look at the seven
primal movement patterns,

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and I analyze them by giving
them functional tasks.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, here, push this
cable just like you were

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.470 align:middle line:90%
going to push a door closed.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.835 align:middle line:84%
Or pull on this cable as
though it was your skis,

00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:12.620 align:middle line:84%
and you were pulling them off a
shelf to put them in your car.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Lift this box as
though you were going

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.790 align:middle line:84%
to load this box in
the back of your car.

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:18.710 align:middle line:84%
So I give them
tasks that show me

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:22.160 align:middle line:84%
how their brain does with
integrating the entire body

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.930 align:middle line:84%
as a functional
system to perform

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.223 align:middle line:84%
a task in an
efficient, natural way.

00:36:26.223 --> 00:36:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And to the degree
that they can't do it,

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.385 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to give
them an education.

00:36:30.385 --> 00:36:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And to the degree that
their body's not integrated,

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:36.200 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to drop them
down to integration training

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.800 align:middle line:84%
before we start doing
integrated exercise.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We have to isolate
what's not working,

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and then progressively
integrate it.

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.720 align:middle line:84%
And while we're
working on that, we're

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.630 align:middle line:84%
also looking at what are
the dietary factors that

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:90%
need to be balanced.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.100 align:middle line:84%
What levels of
toxicity do they have?

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.010 align:middle line:84%
What's causing
inflammation in their body,

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.010 align:middle line:90%
if there's inflammation?

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:56.228 align:middle line:90%
They're almost always is.

00:36:56.228 --> 00:36:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if there's inflammation
in the small intestine,

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.650 align:middle line:84%
for example, or the
stomach or anywhere

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.510 align:middle line:84%
in the digestive system,
the abdominal wall

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.195 align:middle line:84%
will not work properly
because the organs swell.

00:37:05.195 --> 00:37:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Remember, pain, heat,
redness, and swelling

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.010 align:middle line:84%
are the hallmarks
of inflammation.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Just like when a
woman's premenstrual,

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.380 align:middle line:84%
her uterus expands
because it's inflamed.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.740 align:middle line:84%
It's sloughing the lining,
and so their lower abdomen

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.540 align:middle line:90%
sticks out.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Because the uterus shuts the
lower abdominal muscles off

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.480 align:middle line:84%
to make room so
that as it expands,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.772 align:middle line:84%
it can get more blood
flow because if-- and what

00:37:25.772 --> 00:37:27.980 align:middle line:84%
a lot of women do-- they
keep crunching and crunching

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.397 align:middle line:84%
and crunching because they
don't like their expanded lower

00:37:30.397 --> 00:37:31.197 align:middle line:90%
abdomen.

00:37:31.197 --> 00:37:32.530 align:middle line:90%
They don't think it looks good.

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.030 align:middle line:84%
But when they start
sucking that in,

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.760 align:middle line:84%
it strangles the
uterus for blood flow.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.173 align:middle line:84%
And so now, you
can't get oxygen.

00:37:38.173 --> 00:37:39.340 align:middle line:90%
And you can't get nutrition.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can't get waste out,
so it makes menstrual cramps

00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:43.525 align:middle line:90%
much more strong.

00:37:43.525 --> 00:37:46.450 align:middle line:84%
It drags their period
out because the body

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.950 align:middle line:90%
can't heal itself.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.818 align:middle line:84%
If the small
intestine's inflamed,

00:37:49.818 --> 00:37:52.360 align:middle line:84%
you will not be able to activate
your abdominal wall properly

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.640 align:middle line:84%
because if you tighten,
like you naturally

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.530 align:middle line:84%
do to lift a heavy
weight or throw a ball,

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.210 align:middle line:90%
it'll irritate the organ.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So the organs actually control
the whole musculoskeletal

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.390 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.953 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't look
at the organs first,

00:38:04.953 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and you keep
treating muscles, you

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:09.910 align:middle line:84%
end up giving exercises that
actually make the system worse.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's a comprehensive analysis
that all Chek professionals

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.540 align:middle line:90%
are taught to do.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.018 align:middle line:84%

>>WAY: You know, I've dabbled
in several different sports

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:48.932 align:middle line:10%
over the years, and surfing
has been a big passion of mine

00:39:48.932 --> 00:39:50.140 align:middle line:10%
since I've been a little kid.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.405 align:middle line:84%
So simultaneously,
I do skateboarding,

00:39:52.405 --> 00:39:54.950 align:middle line:84%
I've always been out
in the water surfing.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:58.030 align:middle line:84%
And just some summer day,
and it was very small--

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.680 align:middle line:84%
the waves were very
small that day.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:84%
I just dove in the
water in a shallow area

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.140 align:middle line:84%
where there was a sandbar,
on very small wave,

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:10.330 align:middle line:84%
and compressed my
head into my shoulders

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and then extended my
head into my belly.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:18.640 align:middle line:90%
So I had injured my--

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.870 align:middle line:84%
basically the area between the
skull and the atlas vertebrae.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And I took a long
time to find Paul

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:31.470 align:middle line:84%
after going through many
hands and seeing many people.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:37.050 align:middle line:10%
I had pretty severe
neurological symptoms going on.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.750 align:middle line:84%
I think it was probably
a year into the injury,

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.990 align:middle line:84%
it took, until I finally met
Paul, or heard about Paul.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been through
so many people's hands,

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know who
to trust or who to call

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.740 align:middle line:84%
or what to do or to
lose faith or not.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:51.355 align:middle line:10%
I didn't know what
my future held.

00:40:51.355 --> 00:40:52.980 align:middle line:10%
And it wasn't even
about rehabilitating

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.980 align:middle line:10%
myself to skateboard again.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.440 align:middle line:10%
It was like, you
know, I just need

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.440 align:middle line:10%
to function normally so
I can drive to the store

00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.640 align:middle line:10%
to get groceries.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't even
do stuff like that.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.320 align:middle line:84%
So I laid on the
floor in my bedroom

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.340 align:middle line:84%
for like six months on my
back because every time I

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.080 align:middle line:84%
would get up, I
would get vertigo,

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.075 align:middle line:84%
and all the neurological
symptoms would

00:41:12.075 --> 00:41:13.200 align:middle line:90%
start to get more profound.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.230 align:middle line:10%
And I had numbness and
tingling and twitching

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.020 align:middle line:10%
and all this stuff-- limited
mobility from my waist

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:21.360 align:middle line:10%
up to my head.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.954 align:middle line:10%
So I got pretty--

00:41:23.954 --> 00:41:26.790 align:middle line:10%
what's the word--
desperate in my search

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:30.030 align:middle line:10%
for help or for somebody that
understood what was going on

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:10%
after seeing some of the best
doctors in the country that

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:10%
really didn't understand.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.740 align:middle line:84%
Because there was no
broken bones, per se,

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.400 align:middle line:84%
so they weren't giving
me any sort of hope

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.710 align:middle line:84%
in the resolution
of these symptoms.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:44.550 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, I saw Paul.

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I
saw him, he was like,

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.980 align:middle line:84%
I think I know what's going on
here, and you got to trust me,

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.240 align:middle line:84%
and I think we can get you
out of the woods on this.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, do I trust
this guy at this point?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Is this just another
one of those people

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.900 align:middle line:84%
that I've been to that say
they might have figured it out.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And then after they suck a
bunch of my money out of my bank

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.190 align:middle line:84%
account, then they're
like, oh, well, you know,

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:04.107 align:middle line:84%
maybe there's somebody
else that can help you.

00:42:04.107 --> 00:42:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But Paul-- Paul is really
confident in his ability

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:09.120 align:middle line:90%
to understand the injury.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.250 align:middle line:10%
And he just asked
me to trust him

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:16.485 align:middle line:10%
and he commit to his processes
and procedures and protocol

00:42:16.485 --> 00:42:21.350 align:middle line:10%
to getting this injury
on the track of healing

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:23.650 align:middle line:10%
and resolution.

00:42:23.650 --> 00:42:25.890 align:middle line:84%
So I started working
with Paul every day.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:28.680 align:middle line:10%
And then there was
another component

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.170 align:middle line:10%
to that, which was the
chiropractic aspects that he

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:38.730 align:middle line:10%
works closely with a pretty
well-renowned atlas alignment

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.460 align:middle line:10%
specialist named Kenny Sheppard.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.960 align:middle line:10%
So between Paul and
Kenny, Kenny was--

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.960 align:middle line:10%
because I had an injury
that Paul could probably

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.120 align:middle line:10%
better explain it than me.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:53.100 align:middle line:10%
But the injury needed not just
the therapy I was doing with

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.250 align:middle line:10%
Paul, but I also needed specific
alignment with my atlas every

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:00.507 align:middle line:10%
day because what happened
is I tore the ligaments,

00:43:00.507 --> 00:43:02.340 align:middle line:10%
essentially-- and Paul
could speak to this--

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.880 align:middle line:10%
that hold my atlas and my--

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:10%
my skull onto my atlas.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of--

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.160 align:middle line:84%
maybe an analogy would be
like if you broke your arm

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:90%
and didn't get it set.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:17.540 align:middle line:84%
All that soft tissue that I
tore when I had this injury, it

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.850 align:middle line:84%
eventually healed around
my atlas vertebrae, being,

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:22.370 align:middle line:90%
I think it was like 12--

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.230 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in 10 degrees
out range or something,

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and it was sitting
on my spinal cord.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:31.960 align:middle line:84%
And that soft tissue
had hardened over--

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.100 align:middle line:90%
it had a year to--

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and I, at that
point, was so scared

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to move anything because of
the neurological symptoms

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I had going on that I wouldn't
even move from the waist up.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:44.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm at a year deep, and I
haven't even moved or twisted

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.110 align:middle line:90%
or moved my head.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.560 align:middle line:84%
It was like I was cemented
from my waist to my head.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.090 align:middle line:10%
And that was Paul's--

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:55.200 align:middle line:10%
Paul's challenge was to
liberate those vertebraes that

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.770 align:middle line:10%
were essentially
encapsulated in scar tissue

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:02.200 align:middle line:10%
and had healed in
these tweaked positions

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.730 align:middle line:10%
that we're putting pressure,
constantly, on my spinal cord

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.990 align:middle line:10%
and then also align that
in the process, which

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:13.800 align:middle line:10%
after several months of
this, day in and day out,

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.250 align:middle line:10%
therapy with Paul and then I
would see Kenny to make sure

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:21.190 align:middle line:10%
the atlas was
holding and aligned,

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:23.850 align:middle line:10%
I started to see results.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:28.170 align:middle line:10%
And then I started to see
profound results quickly,

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.440 align:middle line:10%
to the point where I went
from trying to just get

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.390 align:middle line:10%
to the back-- back
to a stage of my life

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.320 align:middle line:10%
where I could lift a water
jug out of the refrigerator,

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.270 align:middle line:10%
to considering
going and competing

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.960 align:middle line:10%
and trying to make a
comeback on my skateboard.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.580 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.000 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: That's just
incredible, that turnaround.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.400 align:middle line:84%
I guess the question
that I have for you here

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.200 align:middle line:84%
is where were you
at psychologically,

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.930 align:middle line:84%
about the rest of your life,
the rest of your career, when

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.010 align:middle line:90%
you met Paul?

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And what was it that
even got you to the point

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:06.660 align:middle line:84%
where you figured maybe I can
get back out on the skateboard?

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.028 align:middle line:84%
>>WAY: When I met Paul, I
was already over the career.

00:45:09.028 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:90%
Like, I wasn't thinking career.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.220 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking quality of life,
day in, day out, just living.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.980 align:middle line:10%
Like, how can I
get happy in that

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.290 align:middle line:10%
and not be greedy beyond that.

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.810 align:middle line:84%
That was my goal was just to
get back to a state of health

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:25.080 align:middle line:84%
where I could live
a normal life.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And Paul fixated on like,
oh, that's not a problem.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.890 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get you
back to being the best you

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:90%
can be in skateboarding again.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.560 align:middle line:90%
You know, that was his mindset.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was kind of
like, well, that's--

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.470 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was a little
over the top at first.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:41.260 align:middle line:84%
He's telling me to bring my
skateboard to the treatment

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:44.750 align:middle line:90%
center, or his practice.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.870 align:middle line:84%
A couple days then
after first meeting,

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:49.475 align:middle line:84%
and he's telling me to
bring my skateboard in.

00:45:49.475 --> 00:45:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't realize he was going
to take me outside and make

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.650 align:middle line:90%
me ride it.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And at first, I
thought he just wanted

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.630 align:middle line:84%
to see what skateboards were
looking like these days.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.930 align:middle line:90%
Anyways, yeah.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:01.350 align:middle line:90%
He took me straight into--

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.920 align:middle line:84%
you know, he took me right back
into the ring pretty quickly,

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.720 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.690 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: [CHUCKLES]

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.490 align:middle line:90%
>>WAY: Yeah.

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.960 align:middle line:90%
And that's where--

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.698 align:middle line:84%
Paul's approach
wasn't like, oh, we're

00:46:12.698 --> 00:46:13.990 align:middle line:90%
not just going to get you here.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:16.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get you
better than you've ever been.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.360 align:middle line:10%
And beyond the
injury, I think I can

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.130 align:middle line:10%
make you the best
athlete in your community

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.110 align:middle line:10%
or in your industry or
one of the best athletes.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:30.693 align:middle line:84%
I think I can create an
extraordinary athlete out

00:46:30.693 --> 00:46:31.810 align:middle line:90%
of you beyond.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Which I was already an athlete
and athletic, but, like Paul

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.000 align:middle line:84%
said, there was so many things
that I didn't understand

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.240 align:middle line:84%
about training, diet, and
all these different things,

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that once I got the
injury under control,

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.690 align:middle line:84%
I was able to take all this
knowledge that I had adopted

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.420 align:middle line:84%
from Paul and been
mentored by him with

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.130 align:middle line:90%
and apply it to my career.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm 45 now, and
even-- you know,

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I have some problems, residual
damage, from the neck injury,

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.368 align:middle line:90%
and I deal with some of that.

00:46:58.368 --> 00:47:00.928 align:middle line:84%
And that's just-- you know,
there's a pretty good injury

00:47:00.928 --> 00:47:03.220 align:middle line:84%
there that it's not-- you
just can't erase some of that

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:08.260 align:middle line:84%
damage, but to be at 45 and
planning some of the stuff that

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on right
now, I was like--

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.970 align:middle line:84%
as a kid, I think my goal
was I hope I can make it

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:16.420 align:middle line:90%
to 30 as a pro skateboarder.

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.095 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still doing
it at 45 with these--

00:47:19.095 --> 00:47:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I've had 24 orthopedic
surgeries now too.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
the neck injury.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.370 align:middle line:84%
I've been mentored by Paul
through all of the injuries.

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And I've applied all of
the knowledge and all

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.790 align:middle line:84%
of the data and all the
experiences I've had with them

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:39.160 align:middle line:84%
to everything I do, every piece
of life, my whole lifestyle.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And I've been able to
overcome-- you know,

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I've had four knee
reconstructions

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:43.780 align:middle line:90%
on the same knee.

00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:44.305 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Wow.

00:47:44.305 --> 00:47:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>>WAY: The NFL only
have one, or you're

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.500 align:middle line:84%
going to lose your
contract and probably won't

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.070 align:middle line:90%
make you come back.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:48.870 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Yeah.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.200 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: I just want to say
he was scared as hell when

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.280 align:middle line:84%
I asked him to bring
his skateboard in,

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:03.170 align:middle line:84%
but took me four months of
about four to five times a week

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.990 align:middle line:90%
to get him back in top shape.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I had him jumping from different
types of balance boards

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:13.730 align:middle line:84%
blindfolded, kind of like "The
Karate Kid" but the real deal.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: [CHUCKLES]

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: And I said, until
you can do this obstacle

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:20.150 align:middle line:84%
course blindfolded, you
are not ready to go back.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And he won his
first contest back,

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:23.900 align:middle line:84%
came home with a
paycheck, and that

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.400 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning of the
rest of the Danny Way story

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.200 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: What a testimonial.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.930 align:middle line:90%
This is incredible.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:31.592 align:middle line:84%
And Danny, I want to
thank you so much,

00:48:31.592 --> 00:48:33.050 align:middle line:84%
not just for
everything that you've

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:35.383 align:middle line:84%
been doing that I've been
following for quite some time,

00:48:35.383 --> 00:48:39.710 align:middle line:84%
but for sharing with us the
fact that somebody can come back

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:42.950 align:middle line:90%
from an injury like this.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:44.730 align:middle line:84%
I guess there's
just one last thing

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:46.730 align:middle line:84%
I want to say is when you
were jumping the Great

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Wall of China, what was
going through your head?

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:51.375 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: [LAUGHS]

00:48:51.375 --> 00:48:53.375 align:middle line:84%
>>WAY: That's an interesting
twist in that story

00:48:53.375 --> 00:48:55.630 align:middle line:84%
too because I took a
practice run the day before

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:57.020 align:middle line:90%
and I fractured my ankle.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:57.820 align:middle line:90%
[CHEERING]

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.930 align:middle line:84%
So I had to do that
on a fractured ankle.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So then, again, I go
back into the wisdom

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:04.550 align:middle line:84%
that I've acquired
from all the mindset

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that it's taken to overcome
some of these other challenges.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And when most people
would have just

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:15.320 align:middle line:84%
thrown the towel in and accepted
that this is a wrap, that I'm

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.300 align:middle line:84%
not going to be
able to continue,

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:84%
I was able to not leave
any what ifs on the table

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and just show up the next
day and braced and taped.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And with the right mindset,
I overcame that, but yeah.

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.390 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: That's brilliant.

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>>WAY: The-- but doing
that with a broken ankle,

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.780 align:middle line:84%
yeah it would've been a lot
easier without that going on.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.470 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: I'm sure.

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:34.070 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Danny, I want to thank
you so much for sharing

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.338 align:middle line:90%
this story with us.

00:49:39.338 --> 00:49:41.630 align:middle line:84%
I think that's probably one
of the best testimonials we

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:42.430 align:middle line:90%
could have gotten.

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:44.300 align:middle line:10%
So thank you for taking
time out of your day

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.437 align:middle line:10%
to be with us today.

00:49:45.437 --> 00:49:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>>WAY: Right on, you guys.

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.070 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: All right.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:47.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Thank you.

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.930 align:middle line:90%
You're still--

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:48.230 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: Much love.

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: --my hero, baby.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: [CHUCKLES]

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>>WAY: Hey, vise versa, man.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: All right.

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:53.070 align:middle line:90%
>>WAY: Team forever.

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:53.870 align:middle line:90%
>>BEN: All right.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:54.540 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.410 align:middle line:90%
>>WAY: All right.

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:56.325 align:middle line:90%
Take care.

00:49:56.325 --> 00:49:58.700 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: I don't even know what
I could add on top of that.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.980 align:middle line:84%
That's such an
incredible rehab story,

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:04.940 align:middle line:84%
but I want to say that I read
the book "Rise of Superman"

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:09.830 align:middle line:84%
by Steven Kotler, and that story
was in it about having broke

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:11.780 align:middle line:84%
the ankles, or
sprained the ankles,

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and still doing the trick,
still doing the trick.

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:20.280 align:middle line:84%
That must speak to the fact
that your approach to healing

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.590 align:middle line:90%
is a truly holistic one.

00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:22.390 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: It is.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.865 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Because it's really
about living your life too,

00:50:24.865 --> 00:50:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and not letting certain things
be obstacles if they don't have

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.920 align:middle line:84%
to be obstacles but
also getting over--

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.470 align:middle line:84%
getting out of our own
way when there's something

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:35.960 align:middle line:84%
we want on the other
side of an obstacle,

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.640 align:middle line:84%
learning what it is
that's keeping us

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.557 align:middle line:90%
from moving past that.

00:50:38.557 --> 00:50:40.432 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: You know, all
the systems in the body

00:50:40.432 --> 00:50:41.330 align:middle line:90%
are integrated.

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:43.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't change one
hormone in the body

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.290 align:middle line:84%
without affecting every
hormone in the body

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:47.900 align:middle line:90%
and every tissue in the body.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The problem is is that people,
in the traditional approaches

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.630 align:middle line:84%
to rehabilitation
or medicine, are

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.770 align:middle line:84%
very myopic in their
thinking, right?

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.040 align:middle line:84%
You go see an
endocrinologist who

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.600 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have a clue about diet.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.107 align:middle line:84%
Or you go see a
shoulder specialist

00:51:01.107 --> 00:51:03.440 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't have a clue about
how the spine and the core

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:06.380 align:middle line:84%
works and how the legs work
and how the foot works.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But your little toe knows
what your eye muscles

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.060 align:middle line:90%
are doing all the time.

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Even the corrugated
muscles in your eyebrows

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.110 align:middle line:84%
know what your little
toe muscles are doing.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So when I take someone like
Danny Way, I have to say,

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, we have to look
at every aspect.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.190 align:middle line:90%
All systems have to be go.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:24.680 align:middle line:90%
You can't take a guy--

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.550 align:middle line:84%
because he had a
contused spinal cord.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.480 align:middle line:84%
He tore the ligaments,
the alar odontoid

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.630 align:middle line:90%
ligaments were stretched.

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:31.910 align:middle line:84%
That's the ligaments
that hold your head on.

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.200 align:middle line:84%
They were stretched
to the point that it

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.773 align:middle line:84%
causes the whole nervous system
to go into complete freak out

00:51:35.773 --> 00:51:37.940 align:middle line:84%
because it feels like your
head's going to fall off.

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what holds your
head onto your neck.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:43.280 align:middle line:84%
The interspinous ligaments
that hold the atlas

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and the axis together
were damaged.

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.360 align:middle line:90%
So they were too loose.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.820 align:middle line:84%
So basically, his
head was falling off,

00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and his spinal cord
had become pinched,

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.030 align:middle line:90%
and it swelled up inside.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:55.760 align:middle line:84%
He was a quadriplegic
for two weeks.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.760 align:middle line:90%
Then he went to be a paraplegic.

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Then he couldn't move
his body for six months.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So by the time he got to me,
he was like a piece of wood.

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:05.630 align:middle line:84%
When I actually checked
his range of motion,

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:08.542 align:middle line:84%
he had two degrees in one
direction, three degrees

00:52:08.542 --> 00:52:09.500 align:middle line:90%
in the other direction.

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.000 align:middle line:84%
He could only look
down two degrees

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.075 align:middle line:84%
and look up like
one or two degrees.

00:52:13.075 --> 00:52:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So it was literally
like his neck

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.360 align:middle line:84%
was frozen in ice,
and his whole body,

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.300 align:middle line:90%
because the fear of those--

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:22.305 align:middle line:84%
when those ligaments are
stretched, literally,

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:24.680 align:middle line:84%
you think your head's going
to fall right off your spine.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And it can pinch the spinal
cord, which is what happened.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So fortunately, I had done
extensive anatomy study,

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.660 align:middle line:84%
extensive study in
corrective exercise

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:37.520 align:middle line:84%
and the application of very
complex exercise systems

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.440 align:middle line:90%
for segmental integration.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.930 align:middle line:84%
So I had spent my whole
life studying to know

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:44.120 align:middle line:90%
what to do with a Danny Way.

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And so once I got a
hold of him, because I

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:48.170 align:middle line:84%
work with injuries
like that all the time,

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.480 align:middle line:84%
I knew exactly
what we need to do.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.080 align:middle line:84%
And so my whole education
system is like what do you have

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.660 align:middle line:84%
to understand to really
rehabilitate someone

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.860 align:middle line:84%
effectively, not just to
get rid of their pain--

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.990 align:middle line:90%
that's not hard to do at all--

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.120 align:middle line:84%
but to get them back on
the job, get them back

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.150 align:middle line:84%
into their sport, making love,
riding horses, living again,

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.950 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And really, I've brought
many elite athletes

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.120 align:middle line:84%
out of medical retirement
when doctors literally

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.745 align:middle line:90%
forced them into retirement.

00:53:16.745 --> 00:53:18.120 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: You were
mentioning to me,

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.790 align:middle line:84%
at some point, that
on your podcast

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:23.580 align:middle line:84%
that you had Danny Way on,
that he actually introduced you

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:24.630 align:middle line:90%
to plant medicine.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:25.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHEK: Yes.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:30.900 align:middle line:84%
He was the first one to suggest
a doctor that was using them

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.940 align:middle line:90%
in his clinical practice.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.790 align:middle line:84%
And he felt that it was
such a profound experience

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.400 align:middle line:84%
for him and his
brother that I should

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.360 align:middle line:84%
go try it because, by then, him
and I were quite good buddies.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.850 align:middle line:84%
I'd rehabbed him from
a very serious injury

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.305 align:middle line:84%
that [CHUCKLES] really
was career ending.

00:53:47.305 --> 00:53:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we spent a
lot of time together.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Paul,
trust me on this.

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:53.490 align:middle line:84%
You're going to find
this really worth doing.

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:57.570 align:middle line:84%
So I went and had my
first 5-MeO-DMT session,

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and it was one breath
and 1, 2, 3, God

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:03.600 align:middle line:84%
And I just had a full
on union experience.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.460 align:middle line:84%
But fortunately
for me, see, I was

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.980 align:middle line:84%
raised in the
Self-Realization Fellowship,

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.620 align:middle line:84%
temple under Paramahansa
Yogananda's teachings.

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I'd had my first
samadhi in meditation

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.240 align:middle line:84%
when I was 35, at the
Self-Realization Fellowship

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:18.420 align:middle line:84%
garden, sitting on a bench
overlooking the ocean.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:22.830 align:middle line:84%
I had hired Master Fung, or
acquired him as my master.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:24.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd done years
of tai chi, and I'd

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:28.680 align:middle line:84%
gone into complete states
of union doing tai chi.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So when I had my first
experience with 5-MeO-DMT,

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I was like, this is
mind bogglingly good.

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.000 align:middle line:84%
What blew me away is I
got there in one breath.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.430 align:middle line:84%
But the good news
was is I wasn't

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.120 align:middle line:84%
afraid to experience the
wholeness and the divinity

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.920 align:middle line:90%
that we all are.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And so the beautiful thing was
is that the medicine experience

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:57.210 align:middle line:84%
was a confirmation that my inner
practice had worked because I

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.730 align:middle line:84%
saw lots of people
get very, very scared

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.710 align:middle line:90%
and freak out and panic.

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen many people,
after 10, 12, 15 attempts,

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.750 align:middle line:90%
they cannot let go.

00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:10.470 align:middle line:84%
They don't have enough trust
in the wholeness of themselves,

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:13.620 align:middle line:84%
or what we call God, because
the ego's still too fragile.

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:16.140 align:middle line:84%
The ego's still too
downward oriented.

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.798 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't figured out
that it is everything.

00:55:18.798 --> 00:55:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think all of it works
together very beautifully,

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:27.570 align:middle line:84%
but I think that the
plant medicines are

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:30.630 align:middle line:84%
most effective for
people that have been

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.100 align:middle line:84%
through enough
pain, enough crisis

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.550 align:middle line:84%
to have to look outside
themselves to find the whole

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:38.320 align:middle line:84%
so that when the medicines
open the doors for them,

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.080 align:middle line:90%
they're ready for it.

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, it's kind of like
taking a kid to Disneyland

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and shooting them
out of a cannon

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:48.600 align:middle line:84%
and hoping that they don't
splat when they hit the ground.

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.460 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: Is this when you became
a part of the Native American

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:54.900 align:middle line:90%
Council?

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Is that when you
made that decision?

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHEK: You know, I had
such a profound experience.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And I found it so fulfilling.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And I had powerful
visions, and I immediately

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.170 align:middle line:90%
went home and began to draw.

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And I realized how
many people could

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:11.070 align:middle line:84%
be helped with these
medicines, but I realized

00:56:11.070 --> 00:56:13.380 align:middle line:90%
how very powerful they were.

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor that
Danny introduced me to

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:17.290 align:middle line:84%
had a lot of problems
with his body.

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:18.360 align:middle line:90%
So I said to him--

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I said, I would like
to be taught by you

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:25.500 align:middle line:84%
how to use these things so I can
help people in a skillful way.

00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:27.390 align:middle line:90%
And I will trade you.

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I will work on you
if you will take me

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.803 align:middle line:84%
into a medicine experience
and teach me how

00:56:31.803 --> 00:56:32.970 align:middle line:90%
to use a different medicine.

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:37.020 align:middle line:84%
So I spent one year,
almost every weekend,

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.110 align:middle line:84%
working with him, either
conducting ceremonies together

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:43.700 align:middle line:84%
or him taking me into a
ceremony and me working on him.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And after one
year, he felt I had

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:48.420 align:middle line:84%
the knowledge and the skills
to handle it on my own.

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.750 align:middle line:84%
But to make sure that
I wasn't illegal,

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:54.332 align:middle line:84%
I went through the process
to become a medicine man

00:56:54.332 --> 00:56:56.790 align:middle line:84%
and spirit guide through the
Native American Council, which

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:59.370 align:middle line:84%
I really love because I
really think it needs to be

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:01.290 align:middle line:90%
under a spiritual umbrella.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:04.380 align:middle line:84%
So everything that
I do is basically

00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.020 align:middle line:84%
encapsulated as a
legitimate healing ceremony.

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.960 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot of preparation.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.460 align:middle line:90%
There's prayers.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.908 align:middle line:90%


00:57:13.908 --> 00:57:17.310 align:middle line:84%
There's, shall we
say, ritual that

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:19.710 align:middle line:84%
is enacted in order
to ground somebody

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:24.210 align:middle line:84%
and to keep it sacramental so
it's not just getting high.

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:29.100 align:middle line:84%
And there's follow-up work
that goes on for months after.

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:34.770 align:middle line:84%
So I really feel that my
experience that Danny ushered

00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:40.110 align:middle line:84%
me into opened the door for
me to be one of the people

00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:44.730 align:middle line:84%
to make it safe for people
to get this type of exposure

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:48.690 align:middle line:84%
when it was really a legitimate
healing thing, not just a party

00:57:48.690 --> 00:57:50.220 align:middle line:84%
trick or getting
high or doing what

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.040 align:middle line:84%
everybody else is doing just
to keep up with the Joneses.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And I've had to rehabilitate
many people that have gone off

00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:58.420 align:middle line:84%
into the jungle and just
had their minds scrambled

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.260 align:middle line:84%
by high doses, wrong setting,
wrong set, fake shaman, and all

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.190 align:middle line:90%
that stuff.

00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:04.607 align:middle line:84%
>>BEN: How can
viewers that I know

00:58:04.607 --> 00:58:06.690 align:middle line:84%
are going to want to be
able to connect with you--

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:08.710 align:middle line:84%
how can they connect
with you and your work?

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:13.000 align:middle line:10%
>>CHEK: Well, my institute
is C-H-E-K Institute.com.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.530 align:middle line:10%
We're a worldwide organization.

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:15.790 align:middle line:10%
We're multidisciplinary.

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:17.800 align:middle line:10%
We have doctors,
therapists of all types,

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.900 align:middle line:10%
which is very important
because I teach people

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.190 align:middle line:10%
how to use experts.

00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.690 align:middle line:90%
We're not a one-stop shopping.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.650 align:middle line:84%
I integrated Danny's work
with a NUCCA chiropractor,

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:29.050 align:middle line:84%
which is a specialist in
the upper cervical spine.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.300 align:middle line:84%
I always work with
whoever is the best.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.430 align:middle line:84%
My job is to figure out
who you need to see.

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So all Chek

Paul, I want to say
this is not just

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:20.740 align:middle line:84%
a pleasure but such an honor
to have you on this show.

Paul Chek is certainly a
master of the physical,

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:35.320 align:middle line:10%
a trainer's trainer, a healer,
and an all around movement

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:38.500 align:middle line:10%
expert, but he's also a
deeply spiritual person,

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.480 align:middle line:10%
which is dear to my
heart, who has found

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.430 align:middle line:10%
that true well-being
can only come

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:46.750 align:middle line:10%
through integrating the body,
the mind, and the spirit.
